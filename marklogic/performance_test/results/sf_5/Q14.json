  "text": "After ordering online and receiving a message that stated my food would be at my office at 12:15pm. Mind you I ordered before 11am because it was for a very importan meeting with my boss. I called when I noticed it was already 12:15pm only to be told that they were short a driver and the food would go out when he got back. Ok, I can understand that. However, I don't understand the fact that no one gave me a call to let me know. Instead, the manager told me I should've called the order in not placed it online??? Really! Okay, I wasn't too happy, But it was worst when I received the order and was told that there was no soup because they didn't have it. I was pissed off at that point. I called back only to have the manager not really sound like he cared. He did ask me if there was anything he could do, but all I said was that the communication was seriously lacking. They still charged me and did nothing to keep my business. I am always ordering for my office, however, I will not use Earl ever again.",

  "text": "Good food at reasonable prices.  The best part was the lunch special that gives you the drink and fries for free (normally a $2.25 add on) for free when you purchase a burger or a sandwich. \nI got the breaded tenderloin which was more money than the burger but was really big and worth it. my son got a double burger and fries and my daughter got the kid's chicken nugget meal with fries and a drink. Good fries too! Thick and tasty rather than tiny shoestring ones.  \nWe all ate it fast and were stuffed.   I wished we had saved room for ice cream or a milkshake. they looked great.",

  "text": "I have been wanting to visit Marjie's for months so when my family was in town for Jazz Fest I decided to give it a shot! And I'm so so so happy I did!\n\nFirst of all, Marjie's is located in a shot gun house on Broad Street. There is no parking lot/ easy parking so we parked on a side street and walked over. The restaurant was crazy after Jazz Fest Thursday but we were the luckiest people in the city because we got a table for 4 outside on the back porch. While the inside of the restaurant seemed a little bright/ like someone's home, the back porch was PERFECT for dinner. It is super comfortable and there were string lights which made me feel like I was at a cute little garden party.\n\nOur table for 4 decided to order a bunch of food and share it family style, which I highly recommend! We started with the charred Brussels sprouts (obviously because they're my obsession), which were a little sweet, crunchy, and delicious. We also got the springtime som tam (double spicy)- great fresh veggies, coal roasted sweet potatoes - salty and sweet and oh so good, hush puppies - pretty good but just tasted fried to me, the chili butter yard bird - cooked very well, the herb rubbed gulf fish - great flavor, and the spare ribs - I didn't try them but my family really enjoyed them. All of the food was unique, thought out, and very flavorful. There wasn't one thing that we ordered that I didn't really enjoy, so I know that all of the other menu items are probably amazing as well. And the food was affordable! All of that food plus 2 beers and tip was around $125 - a steal for dinner for 4.\n\nI'm sad that it took me so long to visit Marjie's but I will definitely be back! \n\nFood - 4.5 stars\nPrice - 4.5 stars\nService - 4 stars \nAtmosphere - 3 stars inside, 4.5 stars outside",

  "text": "Eh, this place is fine\" is the thought that keeps coming up as I figure out how to write this review. In my stable of establishments to patron, this is filed under \"Go to if you're looking to give the impression of a fancy restaurant and food doesn't matter.\n\nNone of the food is bad, per se, but I also cannot think of one dish that has knocked my socks off. The same can be said for the drinks. I ordered a apple cider mule last time I was here and I'm not sure what the problem was, but it wasn't good and that is something that is hard to mess up in my opinion. I also had the filet and the cream of tomato soup. The filet was very tender and good, bit the flavor wasn't great if that makes sense. Finally, the  soup was too thick and salty for my tastes and that is saying a lot considering I love salty food! I hate to give a restaurant an okay review, but okay has just been my opinion of the food here.\n\nPrices seemed decent but close to the more than I would have liked to pay' end considering the service was spotty and the food was mostly average.\n\nOther than that, the ambiance was great for getting dressed up and a romantic dinner. Low lighting, and polite wait staff makes this a great go to for dates if you're trying to impress someone early in your relationship.",

The sauce is served on the side and is just the right kind of spicy.  The sweet potato fries are particularly perfect (and I am super picky about my sp fries!) and have a hint of cinnamon sugar about them.  The homemade salsa was chock full of fresh ingredients that tasted like they were in the garden this morning.  All in all, this was an amazing place to feed our family as we passed through.

  "text": "Tried it for the first time the other night because I had a gift certificate for the place.  The area where we sat was dirty - could feel the crumbs on the sofa-like seating and had to dust them off.  Bleh, not a good start.  We ordered from the a la carte menu.  We started with the Casablanca salad which was good, but under-flavored.  We had the chicken tagine and chicken kabobs for entrees.  The chicken tagine was awful.  The seasoning on it was too dense and pungent to eat and the chicken itself was bland and on the dry side.  The kabobs were also bland and dry.  The couscous that accompanied the kabobs was simply awful - bland and tasteless.  \nFor the life of me, I can't understand why a Moroccan restaurant serves pita bread rather than traditional Moroccan bread.  But, even still, the pita was dry and on the harder side, not overwhelmingly fresh.  \nWe did not get dessert.  We did have the Moroccan mint tea, which was good and tasted authentically Moroccan.  \nThe kicker was we weren't able to use the gift certificate for the a la carte menu, only for the \"feasts\".  \nWe won't be using the gift certificate at all because we won't be going back.  \nTo top it off, the belly dancer was not good.",

  "text": "I played Yelp Roulette for Castleton.  They were some other options I wanted to try like burgers and BBQ, but I had that recently. #40 on the list was Joella's.  As I looked at the menu, it claimed the winning spot for my supper.\n\nJoella's is a little different from your standard fast food chicken places.  You get to choose your level of spice, more side options, and dipping sauces you do not get from other establishments. \n\nI went with the Jumbo tenders at the Ella's Fav level with red-skin mashed potatoes and green beans.  For checking in to Yelp, I also got a big wing, which I almost had to argue about receiving.  The tenders were big, juicy, and on the spicy side.  The green beans were ok but the mashed potatoes was very creamy and delicious. The wing had good flavor but has the flaws of most wings, not enough meat and some maneuvering.\n\nOne sauce comes with the meal and one sauce is just not good enough for this sauceaholic. So I chose 5 and paid an extra 50 cents for each one.  A description of the sauces I tried are: Jojo (Mustard BBQ), Bama white (a lot of horseradish), cheerwine BBQ (Cheerwine is a chery flavored soda), pimento ranchero (ranch with pimento cheese), and my favorite  - the spiked honey.  I am having a hard time thinking of a sauce similar to it.  Either way, that's the sauce I'm choosing next time then either the Jojo or Pimento Ranchero.\n\nFor dessert, they have pie in a jar.  I had the chocolate peanut butter one which was very fulfilling. I get to keep the jar too.\n\nSweet tea was Indiana level sweet tea which means barely sweet.  But it was fresh-brewed. \n\nI thought of Joella's as a better Southern Pop-eyes.  If you love fried chicken with some heat, come give it a try.",

The food is decent however it is really overpriced. $13.30 for an order of 10 wings is a lot. Their pizza price is the same. $25 for a large and it is not anything special.

Super friendly staff and they offer a wide range of different coffee drink options which is surprising since the place is so small. They have 1 power outlet and not really a place to sit and work all day but it's great if you are watching a show at the Straz and need your coffee fix. They offer seating outside and no bathrooms. Sitting inside you can hear the show that's performing through the walls which I thought was amusing. They serve Buddy Brew coffee so you can't go wrong with that since it's a local favorite. Good luck finding parking but if you're in the area or going to the Straz Center I recommend checking out this place.",

I said I dont want them she said ok took fries and dumped them in trash never sorry or anything.  so she said to me a bit later have a good day and took her stuff and left. so I ask the next bartender for a manager. manager came I explained the problem as I was talking the girl bartender came up and I told her that I've been in service industry for years and said you should ask what size beer and explain that they dont do sides. as I was asking some other bartender that was ringing up a item in pos system said everyone else does the same thing with a attitude. I said I beg your pardon manager said dont worry about her. really  that employee should be fired. anyway I said I really deal like your just trying to get as much as you can from me because I'm at airport he said that's correct. wow again. I will never eat there again and worn everyone watch out they dont care about you. sorry was hoping for a better experience.  manager did adjust my large beer and buy me one but still deal cheated.

  "text": "My husband planned a fabulous birthday evening for my 40th along with a group of friends.  While the Paramour is beautiful and in the past we experienced a nice dinner, this visit was not exactly great.  When we arrived my husband planned for appetizers to be served with drinks in a private setting while we waited for dinner, several of the apps were more room temp than hot when served.  The space we sat in was very pretty but not at all private, At dinner we sat in a very nice private dining room, several guests were quite pleased with their meals, mine was less than mediocre.  The following day my husband reviewed the bill and noticed we spent $100's less  than the anticipated amount.  My husband contacted the manager and asked if they would offer a gift certificate/credit and mentioned that the servers and party planner never mentioned that we had not spent the amount allotted. Much to our dismay and disappointment, the Paramour was less that cooperative refused to do anything and more or less indicated it was our loss.  just very sad as we have shared this story with friends and co-workers we have discovered this to be more a common occurrence than a rarity.  We will not return due to the horrible customer service, mediocre meal and shadow they cast upon the memories of my birthday..",

  "text": "We were looking forward to a wonderful evening at Oceano Bistro with a large group to celebrate two birthdays. We had heard good things about this place and gave it a try. A couple of people in our group loved this place in the past. I don't know if the quality has slipped or if this is the new normal, but the whole group left feeling very underwhelmed by the experience. Being Restaurant Week, most of us ordered off of the special menu with a few regular menu items added. The problems started when the servers forgot to bring out two of our chowders as the first course. Eight people in our group of ten were eating while two of us had to wait until they were almost finished before we had to chance to tell them that we had not been served our first course yet. Once the chowder came, it was pretty bland. It wasn't bad, just needed more salt, pepper and spices. Next came our main course - mine was trout with mushrooms and green beans in a mushroom sauce. The trout was excellent. The mushrooms were very good, but were very sparse. Needed many more mushrooms. The green beans were too raw for me. I like a little fresh snap and crispness to my al dente vegetables, but these were way, way too raw and had no flavor either. Dessert course was either bread pudding with ice cream or a cupcake. The bread pudding was good, but the cupcake was very dry and non-edible. \n\nLastly, they did nothing to recognize the two of us that chose to celebrate our birthday at their establishment. No drink on the house or complimentary appetizer or anything. A small gesture goes a long way in showing your appreciation for your patrons and making a lasting impression. \n\nThis place was trendy and nice all around, but I was not impressed. The next time I celebrate my birthday, it will be at another establishment. There are plenty of wonderful places in which to spend my time and money.",

  "text": "We were visiting here from TN and found this close (about 7 mins) to the airport. It was smaller than the pictures on Yelp make it seem but that didn't take away from the experience at all. We went about 430 on a Saturday evening. It wasn't busy at all. The bar was open and there are about 6 tables in the front but they also have a more secluded room in the back with a pool table for private gatherings. When we first walked i. The music was playing \nSo the vibes were nice!  We got a table and the man behind the bar came right over to greet us and get our drink orders. They had a full bar and carried a lot of different beers. We just ordered Corona (no pun intended lol). A young lady then came over and took our orders. We got the chicken Philly egg rolls w/tots  and the fish and chips. The eggs rolls i believe are homemade (not frozen) because she asked if we wanted onions, mushrooms, and jalapeños in them-even gave us a option on which cheese we wanted in them. The fish was crispy and fried to perfection and the fries great too! Overall, this visit was great and they service was also great. The guy even gave us some good places to visit while in the city! Great service !",

  "text": "My husband and I love craft beer, so Philly Beer Week is one of the best times of the year - when we have time to enjoy it. I actually had the weekend off for once, so we made sure to hit up as many of the events and bars as our livers could handle. BRU Craft & Wurst was celebrating their 1st birthday so we hit them up for a late lunch.\n\nThey had a live band performing (mostly covers), and although they were good performers, DEAR LORD was it loud inside! We asked to be seated as far from them as possible, and it was still incredibly difficult to hear one another. A place that primarily shills beer/alcohol should foster conversation, not lonely consumption. We like the concept of the 'self serve' drafts that charge you per ounce, but for this latest visit we stuck with the bar's draft list. They had some sandwich specials as part of their celebration - we shared the roasted pork and garlic pork sausage with sauerkraut, both of which had pickles and chips. The food was great with our cold brews, both meats super juicy and tender and instantly put us in a summer state of mind. If it wasn't for the loud music, we would've hung out longer and had another drink, but our ears were ringing and we left to enjoy the sunshine.",

  "text": "If you want an experience with impeccable staff, service and good...tululahs garden is the place. After eating there after the Moshulu, I was so upset that I didn't book them. The difference of attention from staff and care was most noticeable and the food was to die for. I Agree with Jackson and the other reviews below about the Moshulu. Food mediocre, staff inattentive and lack the care for guests and definitely not the place if you want your occasion to be special. I can't believe the difference of how we were treated with a special occasion at tululahs garden a week later, vs Moshulu. I told the staff at tulalahs how awful our whole experience at Moshulu was and how I wish I would have booked them instead. I dined at Moshulu years ago for a brunch buffet and was really excited to come back. I made a very special request weeks in advance and although requests aren't guaranteed, staff wasn't prepared with any knowledge of what I asked to be written in the book. Hostess didn't seem knowledgeable about seating logistics. Our table was immediately inside the door to the left facing the parking lot which defeated our initial excitement and choice of booking this establishment, which was really stressed ahead of time for having a water view. I wasn't made aware of a dj on top of the ship so couldn't eat there with grandparents and loud music, Even though I asked lots of questions when booking. Waiter came over and told me it was an \"off day\" for seating rooms and an \"off day\" overall. We decided to remain at table but the rest of our special night was ruined because we chose this special place for the views and atmosphere and to celebrate a very special and meaningful milestone.. If you are seated in the ship on the left as we were, I would opt to spend that kind of money at an excellent restaurant with excellent food and stellar service such as Amada or any Jose Garces restaurant. At no point throughout the evening did any managerial staff stop over or check in or ask how everything was. When we got the bill the 20% gratuity was added to the check so it didn't matter how they treated us. The manager walked by us as we were leaving and didn't say a word, just headed upstairs. No goodnight, no nothing. The lack of care and professionalism made this worse. Plates stacked on table while tea was being served. Crumbs everywhere and nothing reset. I don't care too much about a reset table but in what's listed as fine dining, I was surprised. Worst $550 I have ever spent and we love spending money on great food, service and experiences. It was such a letdown. When I called the next day to speak to a manager, the Owner's daughter was very nice and promised a call back later in the day. I didn't receive a call that day, No call the next day, the day after. I called back a few times as The lack of acknowledgment first at the restaurant and now by phone, really solidified the lack of care that the manager on duty displayed that night. I finally received a phone call exactly 7 days later. Manager was rude, condescending, and placed blame on me and questioned my feelings. He scoffed at my explanation of events and only apologized for how I feel but nothing on the restaurants end. I was frustrated and questioned by someone who didn't show his face once that night but claimed he was there and claimed his staff was beyond excellent. He told me I was a waste of his time. If this was the case, why would I have called and why would I be leaving a review on yelp? I opened a yelp account years ago and I don't remember using it since years ago. The manager really could have made things so much better by being nice, respectful and at least trying to understand. He instead made fun of me, made me feel like everything was my own fault and insulted me. I would have loved to be invited back for a redo in a nicer location on the ship as I originally requested or on s day where it wasn't \"off\" as the server stated but now, not only will we never come back there or any sister locations in the city, we will never recommend  Moshulu or any of their sister places to our friends or any one else. I stand by Jose Garces establishments for their professionalism, food, and service. I have never been treated so poorly by someone who chose his career in the restaurant business in my life. Awful, hurtful and sad. Waste of money.",

The Roasted Brussel Sprouts and roasted beets were next level. The hamachi & melon was an unexpected yet perfect pairing.  From the hostess to the bus boy the staff was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu and ingredients.  The restaurant is in a comfortable space and the crowd was energized and vibrant. I will definitely return",

He was completely professional in his delivery of food items and graciously retrieved extra drinks and sauces for us. We'll definitely be bsck next year. Chris, the manager was also very accommodating and gracious. He stopped by our table a few times to make sure our visit was perfect.

  "text": "Tang Bistro's been on my radar ever since it first opened. A lot of Northern Chinese spots seem to have opened up recently (South Silk Road, Blossom Northern China Cuisine and Chinese Crepe). TB specializes in Xi'an cuisine.\n\nWe came on a Tuesday evening and the place was half full. The inside is quite spacious and even has a patio facing out onto 109 Street (after all, it housed Urban Diner). The menu is beautifully done and more upscale than your normal Northern Chinese spot.\n\n- Liang-pi (cold noodles) ($7.50) - crap, I didn't realize that you had the option of getting this non-spicy, mild, medium or intense! Would love to see how \"intense\" it really gets. The cold noodles had a chewy, slippery bite. Comes with the usual bean sprouts, julienne cucumbers and spongy gluten. Good but I prefer Noodle Feast's version.\n- Cucumber salad with garlic sauce ($6.50) - the cucumbers had a satisfyingly crunchy bite. The vinegar/garlic sauce was bright and refreshing. Would get this again.\n- Spicy pig ears ($9.50) - the spicy pig ears had a tasty chili oil sauce. Great texture but the portion was pretty small for the price. CC thought it came in a \"ear shaped\" bowl.\n- Scramble egg & tomato ($10.50) with hand pulled noodles ($2.00) - the hand pulled noodles had a great chewy toothsome bite to them and the egg & tomato sauce worked well with the noodles. The combo felt like you were eating Italian with an Asian spin to it. The egg reminded me some sort of delicious cheese. I know that sounds weird but it was good.\n\nThe dishes are a bit on the oily side of things but everything was solid. Will be back to try more dishes. 3.5 stars.",

I was just there two weeks ago. So, as most people point out, the place is classy but expensive....and the portions are a bit on the skimpy side. I like going during happy hour (which I don't think they are having anymore) when the drinks and some appetizers are at a discounted price. Atmosphere is trendy and fresh. My only complaint is the chairs aren't that comfortable to sit on and chat. My girl friend and I split two  appetizers and had some wine. Both appetizers were fresh and tasty. I am not going into details in describing them because I am not sure if they are even still on the menu. I am willing to give this new pizza place a shot, but I really hope they have a happy hour.",

And I will preface this by saying I have been to two other Wasabi's (the one downtown, and the one out in Town and Country) and both of those locations were pretty good. The service at this Wasabi was wonderful, so I am not complaining about service. It was the food. Just terrible. I ordered a lot of nigiri.... amaebi, ikura, maguro, sake, tataki tuna, and uni. I was really excited for the uni too. But it was AWFUL. I seriously cannot believe they would sell this to people. Did the chef even taste it? It was not 'old' or 'sitting out' for too long, just to clarify. It must have been from Maine or maybe the urchins they harvested weren't in season....I don't know what it could have been. But my taste buds do not lie. It was sour, and even bitter. Instead of being soft and smooth in texture, it was almost chewy and it was definitely firm. Blegh. Totally cockblocked as I was prepared to buy a shitton of the stuff. The other things I had were only so-so. The tuna and salmon did not have great flavor. The tuna tataki was the only redeeming piece of sushi on the entire plate. I left still hungry as I sent the uni back. They were understanding about it, but ugh. It was just awful. I am not going to bother to come back to this location if they aren't serious about ordering good quality seafood for their sushi. :(\nOn the bright side, Bob's called me the very next day to tell me they got fresh urchin in-stock. Totally made me rejoice because the uni from Wasabi was just that terrible!",

  "text": "Came her for the first time after I had been wanting to stop by for years on a Wednesday night. The place was PACKED, I think because of the gem show, but we didn't have to wait too long for a table. Unfortunately our table was right next to the front door, and it was a chilly night, so we weren't super comfortable even while wearing our jackets. Some of my review is probably a bit tainted by the fact that they were so busy, but they didn't handle the rush super well. It took awhile for someone to come take our orders, and then awhile for our food to arrive. The food didn't come all at once, but one thing at a time, which was a bit annoying when you're really hungry and just want to start eating. Also, they forgot an item from my order, so I had to wait awhile for it to arrive. I ordered the chicken vindaloo, which I expected to be spicy as vindaloo usually is, but it wasn't very spicy. I didn't find the flavor that great either, personally. Most of the Indian food I've eaten has been in the UK, so my standards may be a bit high, but I wasn't super impressed. I also had a chicken biryani that was ok but not great. Our naan was quite burnt, rendering parts of it inedible. However, the shining star of the meal was the chicken tikka masala - that may have been the best chicken tikka masala I've ever had. While I wasn't thrilled with my dish, I would definitely order the chicken tikka masala again. I also ordered a takeaway order at the same time that I placed my main, and I had to ask multiple people for it and go back to the counter in the back before I got it, after sitting and waiting for what felt like an eternity. If the chicken tikka masala wasn't so good I probably would never go back, but for that alone I would brave the crazy service just to have more",

It's a good restaurant by Burlington County standards, but if you've been outside of the area before and come back for the holidays, you know that this place is so overpriced and doesn't offer anything of quality. First, the decor is so outdated you feel like you've been transported back to a 90s banquet hall inside. The Christmas Eve menu was a mixture of fried food, steamed bag veggies for sides, and pastas in jar-like sauces. Among our dishes, we had the filet (40$ for a steak that wasn't prepared properly either the first or second time and was the size of a baby's fist); chicken francese (supposedly in a white wine sauce, but really just was a creamy/congealed butter sauce). This place is ok for senior citizen groups looking for a slightly-fancier alternative to a diner, but if you're going to pay the price this place charges, why not just go to Philly or NYC for quality food?",

Seems that people seated anywhere other than at one end of the bar aren't privy to that info. When I went last, it was difficult to see what price each beer was supposed to be. Happy hour prices are a vaguely advertised mystery.\n\nThe location is great. It's a spacious corner property with bike parking and lots of street parking, but the space feels haphazardly furnished, like someone threw a couple of church pews chairs into an empty hall with some tables and added a bar at one end as an afterthought. The lighting is nice for a cozy bar atmosphere, though.\n\nThey have outdoor seating and serve food, but the service is incredibly spotty. Bars shouldn't try to be restaurants if they're not interested in good food and have a way of delivering it to tables. The nachos I tried a couple of months ago were barely passable. I've been spoiled by the Cantina for too long, it would seem.\n\n\"Eehhh.\"",

  "text": "I used to consider Penang to be one of my favorite restaurants. Up until two months ago, my partner and I ate there at least twice a month, frequently taking friends who'd never tried Malaysian food and and who weren't quite sure what to order. We begin every meal with the roti canai appetizer, which is wonderful, and we were attempting to try every entree on the menu. The last time that we went, however, we didn't have such a good time. We were starving, and we were eager to have a good meal. When we entered the restaurant, the young woman behind the counter asked us if we were there for the tasting party, and we told her that no, we just wanted dinner. She kept recommending it, and we finally said that we would give it a try. We were asked to pay up front (an anomoly) before she took us to a section of the restaurant that was separate from the rest, and seated us. We sat there hungrily for more than 20 minutes without being offered food or told about food. Whoever was running the tasting party ran it like a hot mess. The young woman who appeared to be in charge (not one of the regular staff) ran back and forth talking to people that she appeared to know. We finally decided to leave, so we got up and asked the hostess for our money back. She asked us if we wanted to sit down at a regular table and order, but the restaurant was much busier than when we first arrived, so I knew it would be at least another 20 minutes before we saw any food. I firmly said no, and we left. It was an extremely disappointing experience, and I'll hesitate to go back again. It's a shame that such a crappy experience has soured me toward such a good restaurant.",

I went back yesterday for the first time, and was struck anew by how much I loved the atmosphere - the art, the coziness, the friendly baristas. And this time I found out how good their food and coffee are! Their bagel sandwiches are delicious and will leave you absolutely stuffed, and I disagree with the reviewer who said their coffee was over-roasted. Their iced coffee, at any rate, was perfect and not nearly as acidic and bitter as, say, Starbucks'. I wish this place weren't so far out of my way, because I'd come here every day if I could.",

The wait to sit down was 10 minutes but we didn't want to wait for that so we sat at the bar which was empty. We waited at least 5 minutes for someone to come over and had to ask to see a menu so we could quickly place an order. I havent been to olive garden in a year and at first glance of the menu I thought the entrees looked a little over priced. To my surprise we also got a choice of soup or salad and we get unlimited breadsticks. The soup and salad is actually a pretty large portion. I ordered lasagna and took my leftovers home. I had a full size meal leftover. \nOverall olive garden was clean, the employees were nice, but in no rush.",

I absolutely loved both! The Crab Dip was piping hot and accompanied by crispy bread while the Crawfish Beignets were so flavorful and unique! \n\nAfter trying these two amazing appetizers I knew I had to order more! Thus, I also ordered the Chargrilled Oysters which were out of this world!! The oysters were smoky but the Parmesan cheese on top brought the perfect contrast! \n\nFor my main dish I ordered the Creole crawfish pasta with a side of the Smoke Fried Oysters. What can I say? I'm a hungry girl! The Creole Crawfish Pasta was creamy and yummy! The Smoke Fried Oysters were crunchy and the remoulade sauce was the perfect touch! \n\nOverall, my food palette loved this restaurant! Thank you for having us!",

  "text": "My parents recently moved to Newtown so they received a coupon for free dozen bagels from Newtown Bagel Co. Since my parents always have a bagel and coffee for breakfast, I went with my mom to pick up some bagels for them while I was visiting. We felt bad asking for just the free bagels, so we asked for 2 dozens and picked up 2 tubs of cream cheese as well.  \n\nThere was no one in the shop as we went in at around 1:30 pm and they close at 2 pm on most days.  We were greeted by a gentleman, but he went into the back as we were picking out the cream cheese and a younger girl helped us with the bagels.  \n\nI felt a bit awkward because as soon as I told the employee that we had a coupon for a free dozen and wanted to get a total of 2 dozens, she said they are pretty low on bagels and asked if we wanted to come back tomorrow and said they probably only have about 2 dozens left (which may have been true if she counted just the ones that were in the bins... but there were about another 5 dozens prepacked on their countertop.)  I knew most bagel shops close early and expected to have a less of a selection available to us, but I didn't expect her to ask me if we wanted to come back another day.  Maybe she was just being considerate... because she wanted us to have more to choose from?  But I just felt that wasn't the thing to say to customers that made their first trip there (with a coupon which made me feel a bit more uncomfortable). She must have known it was our first time there because only first time customers can use the coupon.  \n\nAnyways, I told her that we would see what they have left and go from there... and we were able to pick out the 2 dozen bagels and they still had about another dozen or so left in the bins alone.  I was thinking maybe she said that because they would have to reject other customers that came in after us if they ran out, but they were going to close very soon and they still had a good amount of bagels left.\n\nI wanted to see if she would offer to cut the bagels for me... since throwing them into a bagel cutter is way less work than me sitting at home and cutting 24 or so bagels, but unfortunately she didn't offer and I didn't ask since I just felt a little bit uncomfortable there.  Afterwards when I mentioned this to my mom she said maybe they don't have a slicer... which.... I doubt, but if that's the case I apologize for mentioning this at all.  The employee did offer to give us some freezer bags though, which was nice of her.\n\nAs for the bagels, I enjoyed the bagels... they tasted just fine.  I read some other reviews and some people said they were too light and didn't fill them up... and I can see why they say that, but I don't mind because I actually don't mind a lighter bagel.\n\nI would go back and grab some more bagels if my parents needed some when I'm in town, but my first experience wasn't exactly what I expected.",

Everything was the bomb - my fav was the smoked ribs and the mussels (the meatiest mussels we've had). We also had the octopus (delish), the burrata (creamy), the hanger steak (cooked to perfection), the crawfish Mac & cheese (tasty), and the ricotta dessert balls - HEAVEN! \n\nHad to share a lengthy review because we already can't wait to go back!!

Called them three times on Oct 28, no answer.\n\n-----  (ordered review) -----\n\nMy daughter was attending a middle-school fund raiser at a nearby Applebee's, so my son and I had to find a way to burn an hour of time.  I punched \"bagels\" into Yelp, and Brooklyn Bagels caught my eye.\n\nI grew up in Brooklyn, so the phrase \"Brooklyn Bagels\" has a very specific, almost sacred meaning to me.  Sure, I appreciate the appeal for any bagel restaurant to apply \"Brooklyn\" to their name - it's not legally-defined, and it improves business.\n\nThis place is the real deal.  I don't know exactly what makes bagels from Brooklyn so special, but out of all the bagel restaurants I've been to in Southampton / Willow Grove / Warminster / Hatboro / Horsham / Huntingdon Valley area, only this place nailed it.  The texture and flavor are perfect.  The New York-style menu spans much of the room.  The owner (I presume he was the owner) is friendly, and the sandwiches are excellent.\n\nThe ambiance isn't great, and seating is limited - but from what I recall of similar places in Brooklyn, that too is authentic.  \n\nI strongly recommend Brooklyn Bagels, and as you drive there, make a point of sticking your hand out the car window and flipping off any \"Manhattan Bagel\" franchises you pass on the way.",

  "text": "Many positives...beginning with easy, ample and FREE parking behind the restaurant!  Our order was taken promptly and the staff quickly advised us about the menu in regard to vegetarian and gluten free items.  Amazing iced-tea (unsweet tea mixed with their yummy housemade strawberry lemonade).  I enjoyed one of the best salads ever...the Pepper Patch with an amazing dressing, roasted jalapeño vinaigrette.  The side of roasted vegetables was tasty!  Our son often orders quesadillas when we eat out and he rated the Veggie Quesadilla at Urban Cookhouse as topnotch!  The crowning glory...the strawberry lemonade milkshakes.  We enjoyed dining on the outdoor patio in the shade.  The staff was excellent, attentive, helpful and friendly.  We will be dining here again!  Great place for lunch, afternoon snack or dinner!",

  "text": "The first time I came here I just got bagels and this morning we got breakfast sandwiches. I was impressed with how much filling there was. It was tasty and filling. I had bacon, egg, and cheese, and my boyfriend had scrapple.  However, after trying the bagels on two different occasions I have to admit they are just not that good. They don't have the right texture. They are almost crumbly and fall apart as you are eating them. They seem more like bread. It's slightly chaotic inside and can be confusing to order. I would come back for a breakfast sandwich or to try some of their other breakfast selections since they are local. I would not order bagels from them, as I much prefer the bagels from another place.",

Walking through Center City, I came across this unique French bakery offering a range of pastries from croissants to flourless chocolate cake. Being a pastry lover, it was difficult to resist adding another bakery to the list of places that I have been to but  I am glad I took the chance to try their pastries. The employees were very kind and helped me select a few pastries that met my dietary restrictions.\n\nThe taste of the pastries was between 3.5 or 4 out of 5 while the customer service was 5/5.

  "text": "LOVED this place when it was Tijuana Flats - used to go there at least once a week and was so excited when I heard they would be reopening under a different name. Then they kept pushing back the opening, first the end of January, then sometime February, then late February, and finally March 9th (even though they said they would be open March 8th when called).\n\nEven though it's under the same management with the same staff with similar food, it just isn't the same. For one thing, they've given the place an \"upscale\" makeover, complete with Apple computers as registers and taken simple things like napkin dispensers off the tables. If you were a fan of the cheesy double stack tacos, you're out of luck - they must have been a Tijuana Flats-only item.\n\nMy husband and I ordered our food and 20 minutes later, we were still waiting. Someone came over and asked our name because apparently the order never went through (so much for fancy technology). Then 10 minutes later, our order came out but it wasn't entirely correct. When we pointed this out, all we got was a blank stare. No one ever apologized for the wait or the mistake in the order. The food itself was just ok, but that could be because they threw it together in a hurry. All in all, it was a pretty disappointing experience after waiting two months for the reopening.",

First, when I walked up and saw the open air cafe I was blown away by how cool this placed look and was stoked to see there was a line b/c that generally means that you are in store for a treat when locals take the time to wait for fare.  \n\nThen after waiting in line for a while it occurred to me that maybe the line was due to the comically slow service.  I waited about 10 minutes in a line of about 6 people before putting my order in.  I considered a few times going somewhere else, but decided I should wait it out.\n\nFinally, I had arrived and was able to place my order.  I got an Ethiopian blend coffee and their extra thick sourdough toast with almond butter.  Both were totally worth the wait.  The coffee was a perfect complement to the wonderfully sour toast.\n\nLong story short, this place is definitely worth the trip, but don't plan on getting in and out quickly.",

Their lattes and cappuccinos are also fantastic. You can get gelato in your latte and that is their signature item! The service is always fantastic and the prices are reasonable. You can get three scoops in a small and their flavor choices are vast. The price is about $5 which is reasonable since they pile the gelato as much as they can. I highly recommend the Mediterranean salted carmel, the amaretto chocolate chip and the amarena cherry. Those three flavors together are a tasty combo. Although the hazelnut, coconut, baileys and wedding cake are also amazing. Too many to name so come here for the best gelato in town and see for yourself.",

Yes I swear, it was awesome.\nParking is not the greatest in Downtown Tampa. I really don't like driving around the area, but you will end up paying a small price on the meter.  \nYou can sit outside and enjoy fresh air since the outside is mostly shaded, as well as bring your dog. \nIt was definitely a great afternoon. Would be back again. This is my first try at this location, but I have been to the Westchase location which is even nicer. But they both are as equally tasty.",

Feels like bar rescue, simple menu but delicious. They do have a daily menu on the side. On a blue paper. That usually has something nifty. \n\nLet's talk about the beers.  So, this place has a lot of beer. They don't have the \"mainstream\" beers per sé. But what they do have is an amazing selection. One that would make you lose it. They do have their version of Blue moon or shock top. DON'T get that. Tastes like bitter old lemonade. Everything else is pretty good. They will have some private beers. Again, no buds or millers etc... \n\nBut between the food and the beers, I highly recommend this place. Service is great too!",

Everything was on point and delish! The Caesar salad was made with anchovies in the dressing and even tho I don't like the taste of anchovies, the salad was light and refreshing! The creme brûlée dessert was the best I've ever had! Highly recommend! The one negative thing I have to add is that the water tasted like dirt. Another table complained about the same thing!

Seemed slightly understaffed when more people started trickling in for lunch but were never rude and reasonably fast. \n\nSpace:\nSeems like it's in an old KFC or some other fast food place? They still have the old drive in window up although I'm still not sure if they're using it or not...small space when the rush starts coming in. About 8-9 seats at the bar max, three 4-6 person tables and around 5-6 extra seats against one of the walls. Was able to grab a table but a group behind us had to wait a while for another. They do treat it like a full service restaurant though, waiter/ess has to seat you so no going to grab a seat yourself. \n\nFood: I had half the fried chicken, she had the chicken po boy, also split spiced tots. Fried chicken was very fresh. Breading is thick, very interesting spicy and sweet flavor which I really liked. They have a couple table sauces which go well with the flavor. She said chicken po boy was great. Spiced tots were unique with great flavor but my mouth was a little overwhelmed by all the chicken. I had a Southern Peach. Drink was well mixed, they don't skimp on the liquor. \n\nWould go back again, might try some fried nugz next time.",

After going there a few times with friends, they wanted $20 to park in their mostly empty garage and or outdoor parking. I tried to explain I wanted to go up to the bar for a few drinks, but there was no talking to the \"in charge\" parking guy. Bottom line, won't go back. There are many other good choices with free parking, Frenchies, Palm Pavillion and Crabby Bills to name a few. All of these have better food and drink prices. Sent an email to the company but never heard back from them, not surprised. Just another overpriced  tourist joint with a view in my opinion.",

The omelets are very customizable, and they are quite large.  It came with a side of toast, and a choice of fruit, home fries, or french fries (??).

After reading some reviews, I was convinced to go with the Lemon Basil Mojito..pitcher. At $34 - you get a large pitcher of this cocktail. \nWe started off with the bacon-wrapped bleu cheese stuffed dates as I have an addiction to a version of these that I make with manchego and prosciutto - my version blows these away....way away. Mojo must deep fry their version as the crispiness of the bacon really turned me off. We also got the edamame curried hummus with some lavash crackers. This was simple but tasted really nice - lacked enough crackers to finish off the hummus. \nWe got a flatbread pizza and a trio of sliders (Korean BBQ, lamb, black bean) for our next course. The flatbread pizza was forgettable and the best slider was the black bean for sure. The Korean BBQ had a really strange tasting slaw that needed some spice and salt. The bread pudding for dessert was the all-star of the meal and almost got Mojo four stars. Mojo offered good tasting food and solid drink, but doesn't warrant the price.",

  "text": "This pains me. After a long day of running around, my husband and I just wanted to grab a quick bite before going home. I make it a point to patronize local businesses and we chose Coach's. That was apparently our first mistake and it only got worse. We came in the side door to see a busy bar area; the bartender looked at us, said nothing and went back to her bar customers. Apparently, a server had to be called in, but after 15 minutes of being totally ignored, we were getting ready to walk out. When the new server finally made her way over to us, she was friendly but didn't apologize for the lousy service. She took our drink orders before dashing away again, and came back with them 10 minutes later. At that time, we ordered. I got wings and my husband a patty melt or something along those lines. During the 45 minutes, yes 45, we waited for our food, my husbands beer had been gone to 25 with no offer of refill. When the food arrived, it wasn't worth bothering with. Sloppily thrown together and not at all hot. The wings I got were of very poor quality. Many broken bones, and had an old taste to them. Sauce was flavorless. The blue cheese dressing was good tho. After we had been served, a couple of nice looking guys came in and sat next to us. The bartender (female) who had completely ignored us made a beeline for them. Was so friendly and chatty with them, but never once looked our way. I guess we aren't the \"right\" clientele. I guess Coach's 2 has enough business that they don't need ours, because we won't be back.",

There were a few others dining there but the music was very low, which kind of made the vibe uncomfortable.  Our waiter (I think his name was David) hovered way too much for my liking as if we were a nuisance.  I ordered the lamb sliders and mac and cheese.  They were both delicious and cooked to perfection.  Once the bill arrived it was combined for me friend and I.  (why do restaurants assume to female friends who are dining wouldnt be paying separately?)  Anywho, I asked, can you separate the bills.  To which David replied I can do it myself and itemize the bill and list which card was paying for which, this REALLY ticked me off.  So as I sat there trying to separate each of our orders, drinks and taxes he literally stood over my should, not to offer any assistance but to rush me.  We felt like we were intruding just by dining there.  Plus side, is there were great picture ops on the deck.IF I return when visiting Philly again, I'd definitely ask for a different waiter.",

I was a little bummed that mine didn't have any sauce on it and I kept using the sauce off the Winding Creek roll.  The food was alright overall, but not the best I've had.\n\nThe reason I'm giving this such a low rating is because I got food poisoning.  About 20 minutes after eating there, I started getting symptoms of food poisoning.  Fortunately the illness only lasted about 5 hours, but let me just say that the Cali roll didn't taste that great the second time around.  I didn't even have sashimi, so I'm not sure what caused this.",

The service alone is worth five stars and I will tell you why. We encountered a rude bartender who was openly upset, declaring he was aggravated that they were so busy.  He was rude to my sister in law who's birthday we were celebrating.  A problem seems to bring the best out of these people, the manager and the owner were the most engaged and professional we have ever seen. My brother is a chef at a resort (we will not name here) and he was the most impressed in our party.  But on par with the incredible service was the food. Everything our table received was exceptional. The omelettes are perfect. We had one of each between us. The savory breakfast bowl was very impressive, a great combination of ingredients and well executed. We will be back. And we will be sending a lot of people in the meantime, you can count on both.",

Scott, the bartender that served us on Aug 4th has changed  the latter part of that statement. Never, ever have I experienced such rude, almost threatening behavior from any server, anywhere. He was obnoxious the minute we sat down, made rude remarks under his breath and generally treated us as if we were a HUGE inconvience just by being there.He actually became very aggressive when I had the audacity to ask for the bill. Sam Frankovich needs to remove this guy promptly before he has a lawsuit on his hands. So no matter how good the food is, if I ever see this guy behind the bar (or anywhere else) I will leave.",

The eggs were amazing! They had a great taste, like if they just pick them up from the farm earlier in the morning (seriously!)\nMy husband got the \"Eggs Benedicts\" with hash browns- i stole half of his hash browns and they were so yummy! \n\nThe Service:\nThe service was great, the food came out fast and we had breakfast in like 30 minutes which was what we were looking for. \n\nOverall: 4 Stars (Salmita's Scale) I still want to come back and eat with more time, try more meals and their mimosas of course! ;-)",

It was a late lunchtime on a weekday so it was empty but that fared well for us because service was a-one.\n\nMany interesting items on the menu you don't normally see.  Surprisingly, there were a house special wings that I have never heard of.  Mambo wings.  Had to have them.  Not glad I did.  I liken them to crack or heroin.  If you never try it, you won't ever crave it.  I am a pushover for wing recipes I haven't had and I never heard of Mambo wings so I had to get them.  Now, I crave them daily.  \n\nWaiter said they got the recipe from D.C.  Now I research them and they have been around a long time there although more often called Mumbo wings.  Mumbo sauce is apparently common in chinese take out joints in D.C. but has a large wing following.  Enough that there are Mumbo wing restaurants.  I have been a wing-head ever since they first came to this area with Hooters, Melons, Mugs N' Jugs and mostly because I lived across the street from Knockers (where the original Winghouse is now).  That was around 1989.  27 years of wings and I have not heard of Mumbo wings.  Damn you to hell 1933 Pub & Grill.\n\nNot sold in Walmart.  Not in Publix.  Not in Winn-Dixie.  I must make the trek to 1933 or suffer the consequences of $15 per bottle on Amazon or Walmart.com.  This may be my last review as I may be broke soon due to the scarcity of Mumbo sauce in this area.",

Dumplings are only sold in groups of 5 unless you head over on Wednesday when they have $1 dumplings. Typically you can not mix Sweet and savory but the counter guy was feeling friendly and allowed me to do so. My friend and I ordered a cheesesteak noodles and a 5 pack of dumplings. Taco, buffalo chicken, cheesesteak, apple pie and cheesecake. There are sauces on the table are great for dipping. As a condiment lover, enjoyed them greatly! The dumplings were packed with flavor. The cheesesteak was my favorite savory And the cheesecake my favorite sweet. Apparently cheese is the key to my happiness! I might have ordered another if they available individually.\n\nThe noodles were fresh. Ramen style but fancier. They were tossed in a white super gooey delicious cheese sauce with large pieces of cheesesteak and perfectly cut scallions. \n\nLooking forward to hearing back to try some more. Hopefully my next trip will be on a Wednesday where you can buy as many or as few as you would like!",

Now you could do the fancy brunch buffets, or pick the perfect patio to while away the day, or you could get right down to business and cure what ails ya with some serious food, like the brunch slice at Noble Pie! \n\nThis piece of pizza is nothing to muck with! They top a large slice with their creamy and garlicky bianco Base, a light layer of mozz, prosciutto, sun-dried tomato, asparagus, and red onion, and then top it with spicy hollandaise and... wait for it... a FARM FRESH EGG! As soon as it arrives you've gotta slather that ooey gooey egg yolk all over the slice and enjoy. The flavor combo is dy-no-mite and it's the perfect piece to put that hangover out to pasture! \n\nOn top of that beauty, Noble also rocks a full brunch menu with calzomelettes, sourdough toasts with eggs, cheese, and fresh veggies, a BYO Blood Mary and Bottomless Mimosas, and a full cocktail menu, all served up in a chillaxed atmosphere! Oh yeah, they also have gluten free crust and are happy to accommodate any special requests you might have.\n\nNoble is an awesome addition to downtown Reno and a stop worth making for brunch, lunch or dinner.

It smelled a little off, especially in the back.  I got the curry chicken and the wife got Fried wonton & seafood soup.\n\nThe curry chicken was totally bland and also basically lacking one thing, chicken.  I was really let down by it overall.  The soup, which I did try, was okay but still not as good as our usual place, PHO 21.  We also got pork egg rolls for an appetizer which again, were okay but nothing great.\n\nIt was also about $6 bucks more for the same amount of food as compared to our usual spot as well.  They did have a wide variety of things to choose from on the menu but with what we had tonight being so poor I doubt we will be back to try much else.  The other thing I didn't really care for was our waitress.  She left me feeling like we were a nuisance to her overall because we had the audacity to come into the establishment and order food.\n\nWith so many Vietnamese places in Reno you can surely find one better than this place.  I highly recommend PHO 21 just off McCarran next to the Flowing Tide Pub, much better.",

By far the best dude there, and he even offered to give me some salsa in a to-go container after raving that I really enjoyed the taste.(Made in-house) \n\nIt can get busy after 10:30ish am so just be prepared to wait if you aren't an early morning person. \n\nIt's also pretty nice that the bar-top is first come first serve. Easy for 2 people to squeeze in quick if there is a long wait. \n\nHighly recommended",

  "text": "Woohoo is right! Hubby and I found this great place on our fifth day in this lovely city. I settled in at a nice table by the window and he ordered for the both of us.You order and pay at the counter, which is cool. He knows what I like for breakfast and that makes me happy. I got the egg breakfast with bacon and perfect over easy eggs. No toast but the best homemade biscuit ever.   Hubby is not a big fan of biscuits but kept sneaking bites of mine and said it was the best he ever tasted(bold statement). He ordered the Envie which is eggs,brie and ham on a fresh croissant. I'm telling you, we were both so happy after eating, it was sinful. The cook  (Steven I think), delivers your food  which is a great touch. Hubbys'  food was delicious and mine was very tasty. We both had the cafe au lait , which was nice and hot and creamy, I added cinnamon to mine. I love this place and will be back every time we come to this fine city. If you're tired of the touristy breakfast places in the Quarter, try this hidden gem just off Bourbon Street, by the river, in one of the oldest areas of the city. If you don't like cool, funky coffee shops with awesome open air seating, great food, and quirky but very cool staff, then I would suggest hitting a Starbucks for a $4 latte and a stale muffin, don't worry we won't miss you.",

To start with, the chipotle, almond guacamole is hands down the best guacamole I have ever tasted (sorry, mom). It was perfect size and perfect taste. I tried looking for it on the menu but I didn't see it so I hope they didn't do away with it - if you are there ask about it! You won't regret it. \n\nFor the main course, I had the molcajete de carne which was delicious and a BIG portion. I didnt share it but it might be good to share. If you plan on having your traditional mexican beers at this place forget it. They don't sell XX or any other mexican beers that you have tried in the past. They sell what they call \"an authentic\" mexican beer which is good. My date had a margarita that she thought was good. \n\nThe restaurant has a pretty good feel to it - dim with traditional mexican decorations. I didn't really like our table as we were off to the side and it was kind of small. We were in the walkway so it was a bit uncomfortable. \n\nThe waiter was knowledgeable, funny and attentive. He even taught my date a few spanish phrases which was cool. \n\nOverall great experience at tequila's a def must go if you are looking for mexican food in Philly.",

I would say though everyone needs to try out the buffalo wing and the potato pizza.\nThe guys who work here are awesome! They always make convo with me and usually know what i want to eat just by what im looking at and throw it in the oven for me. \nWhen you get inline you get to walk past the case of fresh pizza's and point out which one you want. They take a slice of that and toss it into the nice oven and get it out to you ASAP. \nThe seating is First Come First Serve. Great place to go to watch the game with friends and have a pizza and beer.  You can definitly hawk/vulture tables till it becomes empty. Great college place to be at.

I will say when we went Thursday after mardi gras they were a little short staff. ( the hostess was serving tables, passing water, and hosting) it was a little annoying but after seeing her move I was impressed. Not to mention the food was not skimped over at all. This is why they still get 5 stars from me.",

  "text": "Based on 4 bowls of the Pho Tai, we were not impressed.\n\nThe broth was ok, not as layered and flavorful as I'm used to.  \n\nThe side plates with lime were good except for the lime on two plates: the end pieces with less juice than needed, and the bitter liquid from the rind squeezed out too.\n\nBut most disappointing was the \"rare steak.\"  It was very tough and chewy, not pleasant to eat. Two of our party left most of it in their bowls.  One of our party kept casually listing all the pho places she knows that are better, not intentionally slandering this place, but saying what she preferred about other places, which turned out to be everything...\n\nExcept the egg rolls, which she liked a lot.\n\nThe Thai tea was good. \n\nBest about the experience was the service. All of the girls working there were great, kind and helpful.\n\nI'm not going to have the pho again, but will likely come back to try the banh mi.",

  "text": "My boyfriend and I were walking downtown trying to find a nice place to eat dinner. We came across this restaurant which was conveniently located by the parking garage. We took a quick look at the menu and decided to give it a try.\n\nThe server was friendly although extremely slow! I ordered the beer sampler which gave a taste of their 6 different beers while my boyfriend ordered a mojito. The mojito was horrible and tasted like pure soda water. We were able to switch it out for a sangria which was pretty bad but we didn't want to complain again. For dinner, my boyfriend ordered the smoked half chicken which came out extremely dry and flavorless. I ordered the margherita pizza which was the worst thing I ever ate! It was pure garlic throughout the entire pizza. I even got sick within 10 minutes of leaving because of how much garlic the chef put into it. \n\nThankfully, the server was friendly and took the pizza off the bill even though we never even interacted with a manager. The ONLY reason I am giving this place 2 stars is because of how nice the server was. This place definitely looked promising from the outside but was a complete waste of time. We will never be back again!",

I guess in my mind, British pub food just shouldn't cost more than $10. They are always very busy (which is good for them) but it can take awhile to get seated. Their service can be hit or miss. (One time, we had a great server who was very helpful. Another time we had another server who we didn't have such a great experience with [my husband ordered beer for himself and when he switched seats b/c the sun was in his eyes, she assumed that he was giving me his beer and yelled at me and demanded for my ID (I was not going to have any beer, my husband was just sliding the beer across the table to his new seat!). Also, we paid via credit card but tipped with cash. We put down a bill and she just picked it up, never brought us change or asked if we wanted any. I guess she thought she deserved a 23% tip!) \n\nWe haven't been here in awhile and I don't see us going in the near future. I think it gets a lot of hype b/c it's on Beach Drive.

The bourbon honey fritters were GAS. My bulgogi entree was mediocre at best and I ended up trading my husband for his scallops. I haven't had any issues with scallops until then. They tasted great, presentation was ok (there's only so much you can do about scallops on a bed of white rice atop a metal tray... lol), but hours later I was not alright. I will definitely come back here and only order appetizers and drinks. Love the history behind the building and I'm sure it's a popular spot in the summer... absolutely beautiful and very clean inside! The bathrooms could use more attendance at night though, there was so much water on the wide counters that my shirt got soaked while I was trying to reach for the faucet handles lol. Be aware if you are going there as a couple they put smaller tables between 6-tops so we were sandwiched between two very loud groups. We ended up spending most of our dinner either texting each other or rolling our eyes at the inappropriate conversations coming from next to us lol!",

  "text": "I have to agree with my fellow yelpers, this is a great place for brunch. Classic diner fare with a southwest twist.  We had Jonathan's famous fiery scrambler with homemade sausage and gravy on the biscuits along the new mexican breakfast burrito.  The sausage had a good flavor but was cooked into a hockey puck, so if you get it (and I do recommend you do) maybe get it in one of their dishes instead of on the side.  The fiery scramble has great flavor and I highly recommend it.  The potatoes were deep fried which is not the way I prefer my breakfast potatoes cooked, so they were just alright.  The burrito is huge, so plan for left overs.  You can add the optional green chili on top; we didn't and regret that decision.  Will have to come back and try it again.  The place is crowded, so plan for it.  The bus outside offers a place to grab drinks while you wait, so that is a plus.  Will definitely have to give it another try.

The duck was amazing, perfectly cooked and the sauce that came with it was great.

They have a wide variety of options - cuisine from the North and South of India. The restaurant can get a little busy during lunch hours, but that is a good sign that the food is great and tasty. I recommend this location to anyone wanting to try great Indian cuisine in the greater Nashville area.",

For dinner, I once just had a cup of their vegetarian chili which was amazing! Definitely will get a Bowl the next time. However, I was not so thrilled about their salmon burger. It was mashed up salmon with other ingredients. I thought it was going to be a piece of grilled salmon in a bun. Whatever was mixed with the salmon and the sauce that was drizzled on top of the patty did not go well together. The salmon burger lacked some flavor.\n\nI'll have to find something else on their menu for a dinner option.",

It's the only place where a quick, inexpensive meal that's made with real food can be purchased as far as the eye can see. Think of it as a fast casual version of Mongolian BBQ.  Pick a starch, a meat, veggies, a sauce and they grill it up for customers. \n\nThe interior setup is awkward with customers having to cut the line in order to fill their cups with ice and tea, which are positioned opposite each other. Besides that though, I'm a fan. \n\nI ordered the subtlety spicy finadene chicken with brown rice, broccoli and mushrooms and left not even a grain of rice in the bowl. I finished it off with a piece of crazy good carrot cake, and washed it all down with some u sweetened tea. With the tip, it cost me about $15.",

I can go pickup a large 2 topping for under $9 tax and all, there's not any other pizza places around town where you can do that. I haven't tried any of their other food as I'm perfectly content with pizza. They've got one of the best marinara sauces I've ever had and their mozzarella cheese sticks are mouth watering.\nIf you haven't caught on yet, I'm a big fan of this place. I highly suggest you go try it out if your around town. You can do take-out/delivery/or dine in. They have a good size dining room with servers who tend to you. If you go on a weekend sometimes they have a live band or singer on the stage. That's right,  they have a small stage as well. Good times. Go. Try. Enjoy.  -TnT-",

How is it possible that the food can be even more delicious every time? I don't know, but Khmer Kitchen makes it happen. My sister and I got the fried calamari again, the weekend special which was a coconut curry soup situation, the lemongrass beef stir fry made extra spicy, and the caramelized pork. Sigh. Just wonderful. This time the lemongrass beef was tender and delicious! And wow...they weren't joking about the spice. We might have to go down a few spice levels next time. Basically everything I wrote before about the dishes we'd already had rang true this time as well. The surprise was in the weekend special. Wow...it was everything we didn't even realize we needed. The flavors were complex, warming, with a hint of sweetness and spice. I loved the giant, soft chunks of potato and carrot. My goodness, it was delicious. \n\nI love this place. I will take everyone I care about here, and you should too. \n\nOh yeah, our waiter is always awesome! Really attentive and doesn't mind that we ask for a million bowls of rice :)",

At this point I believe I've tried 4 different kinds of their tacos, the chicken tortilla soup, cowboy beans, rice and black beans, all the salsas, guac, and their \"almost guilt free\" donuts. I'd honestly be hard-pressed to choose a favorite anything. \n\nAlso, despite a poor first experience due to a corporate happy hour taking place while I was dining there, subsequent visits have been quick, courteous, and pleasant! I was in and out in an hour when taking a lunch break for work, even! \n\nWhen Nada found out about my lengthy wait times during my first visit they were extremely generous and provided me with a gift card to come back and try them out again. I couldn't help myself - I went back the day I got the gift card in the mail! You'd better believe I'll be back again soon.",

Unfortunately, I went back to Spitale's on two different occasions recently and the food has gone downhill. The first time I went back, I ordered the Red Beans and Sausage lunch plate...the beans were beyond bland and the sausage was tough and rubbery. I could heat up Blue Runner beans and cook sausage at home and it would taste better than the $12 lunch platter that I bought. The second time I ordered a salad to go. I know, ordering salad from a deli is dumb, but it's hard to screw up a salad. The veggies were soggy and the chicken was flavorless. I don't think I'll be ordering from Spitale's anytime soon.",

The crab flavor was strong and the corn had a good bite to it.\n\nGumbo- M liked it more than me. He remembers liking it more last year. Not a big fan of all the okra.\n\nShrimp & Grits- Yum! I liked the heartiness of the grits and the sauce was tasty. Good amount of shrimp.\n\nP&J oysters- I didn't have any but M like these a lot.\n\nNow onto the bad. Our waiter was never really around. After having the fritters, we were served the oysters but our table didn't get cleared of the empty basket of fritters. After the our entrees came, the basket of fritters,the oysters, and dirty appetizer plates were still sitting empty on our table. We had not received the gumbo we ordered so someone else (still haven't seen our waiter) brought it out. \n\nWhen Matt was 80% done with his main entree, our waiter finally came to check on us and asked if we needed anything from him. Uhh... Yea! How about clearing the table? Or checking to see how our food was because maybe then he would have known we were served our last appetizer after we were already served our entree. \n\nFood was great, but the subpar service tainted the experience. We did let a manager know on the way out. If our server was around we could have told him too.",

I showed her the ones I had tried and she asked if I wanted to sample any others(no one ever asked me that). \nYes please! Big Dog IPA is my new fave!\nThe food was also delicious. My daughter,son and I ordered  pizza and salad. My husband had the street tacos. All were equally delicious. Decent  prices & good portions Of food.

The waitstaff is normally decent; it's a diner so don't expect much. \n\nIt is crazy how this place is open 24-7 and someone is always there eating something. We once saw a family there at 4am who were talking about how they just finished driving home from a road trip vacation, and all they wanted to do was eat at Tom Jone's, and then go to bed. On Sunday after church it is crazy, and the line is out the door. When we were in our early 20's we'd often have parties and send the late-night people to Tom Jones for some food to sober up. They always loved it. There is something about the atmosphere, reminds me of \"Pulp Fiction\" somehow, in a vintage way.\n\nWhat to eat? BLUE RIBBON, Baby! Last time we bought... for $3.89 you get: 2 sausages + 2 bacon + 2 pancakes + 2 eggs + OJ + coffee + 2 slices toast !!!!\n\nIt is always done FAST and it's always decent diner quality.\n\nBrookhaven is dry so don't expect any booze here.\n\nIt sucks, but CASH ONLY!\n\nThey have a walk-up pick up window on the side, but any time we ever did pick up they never used it.\n\n(This place is so Delco, Tommy Pope's gotta know about it... hopefully we may see a rendition of it in his Comedy Central \"Delco Proper\" webisodes.)",

  "text": "First time here. Called ahead and was seated within 5 min of arriving. I loved the decor of this place. There are cars in the building, the bathroom sinks are made of tires and the faucets from gas pumps. It really has a great feel to it. However, I was not impressed with anything else. I try not to bash service anywhere as I was a server and bartender for 10 years and I know how difficult the service industry can be. On that note, I'm sad to say that the service was very mediocre and the food was just ok. After being sat, we waited 15ish minutes to order drinks and then another 10 to receive them. It then took another 30-40 min from there to receive our food, making it an hour + from the time we were sat till the time we were brought food. Also, I got the spinach artichoke appetizer (which I give an A+!) AFTER the dinners were brought out. My first burger came out cold and well done. I do not like my burgers like hockey pucks. The manager made her rounds and I had to express this to her, which she immediately corrected. Because I chose to customize my burger, it was going to cost almost 22.00 to which I was surprised by when I received the bill! Fortunately the manager had taken care of it due to the mix up. If you order a burger here, pick one off the menu and customize that. It'll be cheaper. My oldest daughter also got a burger but she wasn't too happy with it because it was also well done. She just chose to suck it up and eat it. In the brighter side, My husband got the model A burger and he did love his. On the not so bright side, he also got a beer flight and they were out of quite a few of the beers he had chosen. My youngest two got children's meals and they ate them but they eat what we tell them to. The waitress seemed a little overwhelmed with all of her large tables and it was very loud so if you're looking for conversation, go somewhere else. All in all, it was ok. Not the worst I've ever been to, but certainly not the rest. My recommendation to Fords would be to hire more people or train them a little more. I might return to give it another shot at the husbands request, but it's not a place I'll rush to anytime soon.",

The uncomfortable chairs with the dollar store seat cushions  were from an average reception hall, the table uneven because of the extended leaves transforming a square table to round and unless you are seated by a window, you could be in any average restaurant. The staff were dressed for a rodeo, clumsy and untrained, randomly picking up and dropping off dishes. The trendy, hipster manager spent more time smiling at his cell phone than engaging with guests. The average price of an entree was $35 with an a-la-carte option for salad and garnish. The only included item was the bread that was as fresh as the rolls at the box grocery stores.  Again, while the entrees were well above average, the rest of this experience is labeled a tourist trap and I doubt locals visit often unless they have a disposable income and overlook the lack of attention or concern to guest experiences.",

I was just surprised that they took the fish off my plate and back to the kitchen to cook further instead of taking my entire plate. Having the rest of my food and my utensils on the plate with under cooked fish made me nervous. I also was surprised that they didn't offer some sort of complimentary food or price break. When the Sea Bass was returned to me it was over cooked. Not horrible but enough that it was somewhat dry and tough. I will probably never return to Brophy's after this experience. I also sampled the clam chowder and it was very salty. I think this restaurant has gone downhill. Too bad. It used to be a great restaurant known for their freshness.",

For being a brewery, the seating area is pretty small, and gets tight with the pool table and shuffleboard.  It makes sense that they're moving to 5th and Spring Garden and I'm extremely happy they are, and can't wait to see the new digs.\n\nEvery bartender I've spoken with has been pleasant and everything from the Brawler, to the Pale Ale, to the IPA, is tasty.  Most recently, I got a flight of their different holiday-themed beers and they were all great.  You can't go wrong.\n\nOverall a fun spot to chill, but beware, it gets crowded on rainy days.  With the new location coming later this year, I'm hoping for a larger area to hang, drink, eat, and play games.",

They were easy to deal with from the start, showing me around despite me popping in without even a phone call. And then when working with them over the phone and email, everything was straight-forward and helpful. The event went off without a hitch and the staff was ready for anything and everything. Everybody was willing to help, regardless on if it was their \"department\" or not. They saved me when my ipod stopped working; they took care of proper sound for presentations and even climbed up on a chair to cut down a banner I had hung. I highly recommend Jackson's for any sort of event - with the Waterfront Room being a top-notch location for a fun and memorable event.",

My favorite part of Shogun is the fried rice. I'm not sure what they add differently, but it's ridiculously better than anywhere else I've eaten. \n\nThe steak was cooked like I asked and the rest of the meal is how you'd expect at a hibachi place. The sushi we ordered was great as well. \n\nI'm taking a star off for a few reasons. First, it's more expensive than hibachi places in the area. Second, the salad dressing was a little runny. Lastly, I'm not sure when noodles started to become a regular thing, but I wouldn't mind if they went away.",

The salads that we saw nearby patrons eating looked great too. Seating is communal - large picnic tables and bar seating (both by the bar and the pizza oven).  Open view of the pizza oven was entertaining!",

This location, by far, was the créme de la créme on every level. Customer service was beyond superb. An 11!!! Bradley, Manager, was the most helpful, friendliest, informative, patient catering manager I've ever had the pleasure of doing business with. Seriously thought I was speaking with someone from Nashville, TN (as many Southerners are very hospitable and kind). Not only did this stop with the order but continued when I updated our order to the day of the event. They called ME! to check if I was still picking up at confirmed time, so they could place the chicken in warmers to be sure we got a fresh and ready batch!!! WOW!!! Then...the FOOD was perfection!!! Everyone at the event asked where this was from and raved about it. Generous portions and sizes. Great value for the price! Thank goodness we had some leftover for the guests of honor to take home for out of town guests and to indulge in one of their favorite foods (specifically from this establishment). Go here or order from here. You will not be disappointed!!!\nFYI: Heard they're opening another location in Broad Ripple ;)",

  "text": "I have literally avoided writing bad reviews during COVID and have been deleting previous ones. But this is the one time I felt let down by Yelp. I came here expecting the 4.5 start experience and got something below mediocre even though we were hungry and would have been easy to impress. Firstly, yes it's expensive. But I have never had an issue with price when getting something worthwhile. The decor was not mind blowing and neither was the service. It was GOOD. Then comes the menu with \"fattoush\" and \"tabouleh\" labels and clear attempts to sound Mediterranean. Tabouleh had broccoli, there was NOTHING tabouleh about it. Would people call a bagel a croissant? Or a burger a philly cheese steak? That's what this place was doing. It is a little offensive to middle eastern people that food labels would be exploited to that level. There is so much room for creativity when it comes to modernizing traditional dishes but this place was just all over the place. Nothing made sense. The fattoush was literally kale and apples. Fattoush is traditionally a finely chopped salad with cucumbers, tomatoes, parsley, and toasted/ deep friend pita as the essential ingredients then it varies from one Arabic country to another but they ALL drown the salad with olive oil. This salad had no trace of olive oil or fattoush. We liked the idea of the carrot hummus but it tasted like bland purée. There was no texture, it was so runny and just a major fail. I never thought it was possible to screw up hummus, but I guess I was wrong. The cherry on top was that the hummus isn't served with complimentary pita, we had to order a tiny pita. What are $2 for a fine dining type of restaurant? Why would you even charge your customers for bread? Customers who'd frequent these types of restaurants would be indifferent about an extra $2, but I know it simply does not reflect well on the owners. I wondered if perhaps the owners had ever seen people scoop out hummus with a spoon to eat it? I was very confused. That said, the complimentary side dish of fresh herbs, cucumbers and turnips was a nice touch. Secondly, 3 out of the 4 things we ordered were just drowning in dill. The menu had not mentioned the dill, but I felt like all I could taste was the dill. Garnish in Mediterranean food varies and dill is probably one of the least used herbs for garnish. The fish was the least offensive dish, (the one thing that is served with dill didn't have dill in it ) but the side of rice which had delicious chopped preserved lemons was drowning in an extremely salty scoop of butter. We had to dump the butter out to be able to enjoy the rice. I couldn't help but wonder if the restaurant had just run out of olive oil. Lastly, to use the restroom, I had to exit the restaurant, walk through a hotel lobby and use a beat up public bathroom. what kind of a 5 star dining experience makes you use a beat up restroom to wash your hands? I felt like this place was just a bit of a scam.  $100 for the two of us was so not worthwhile - I was genuinely upset for sacrificing my last meal in Philly to a place like this. In summary, if you're looking for modern Mediterranean cuisine, look up Illili (Manhattan), Albi (DC), or the following places in Philly: Zahav, Surayya, Cafe La Maude, etc.",

The 3 girls had some attitude that made me feel like I was putting them out. The young male was very polite and accommodating. I would just like to be greeted with smiles and friendliness every time. One of the girls is often there when we come in and always acts like she is so unhappy about being at her job. We spend a lot of money there and we aren't fussy people.

Each of their twenty-something ice cream flavors is \"handmade\" (although I'm not...quite sure what that means), and their frozen cappuccino is freshly composed each day, in house.  Pastries and touristy-treats are also available, although those are provided by outside vendors.  Service does take a little while, since each drink is made to order-- I guess you could say, \"with love.\"  The ice cream is worth the wait, though!\n\nPerhaps Mike knew that I was a tourist, or, perhaps I am just that cute *wink*, because I was served a scoop of Tennessee Fudge so generous that Texas would be jealous!  It was smooth and creamy, but not gluey, like some other gourmet ice creams can be.   I also sampled the Pistachio, Red Velvet, and Moose Tracks, which were also delicious.  \n\nYes, it was still so early in the morning that people were just barely arriving at work.  Didn't matter.

I have always had a pleasant professional experience up till now and after today i am very upset and will probably never order from them again due to the way I was treated today. I called around 3 wed apr 6. I tried to order the \"spinach alfredo\" which was listed on the websites menu. The lady taking the order did not recognize the item so i was looking for my physical copy of the menu to see if it was on there (which it wasn't) then a very rude gentlemen with a heavy accent (who was apparently the manager) took the phone from her and demanded to know my order to which i said i wanted the pasta milano, he then repeated the order back to me very quickly and it didn't sound right and then he hung up immediately . well the order got to my house and it was wrong. It was the \"pasta new orleans\" which has shrimp in it which im deathly allergic to. I have worked in a lot of restaurants and normally i don't complain if the order is wrong and will just take it anyways but since it was shrimp i told the delivery driver i would not be able to eat it and i was not going to pay for it. He was kind and professional. He called his manager to see what to do, the manager asked to talk to me. Before i could explain he demanded that i pay for it since he had taken the call personally, he said \"you did not know what you want i gave you what you want\" i tried to explain  i would never in a million years order anything with shrimp. He would not listen, talking over me demanding that i pay for the order saying quote \n\n\" F*** YOU I WILL CALL THE POLICE YOU ARE F***ING SH***Y CUSTOMER YOU PAY FOR THE ORDER\" \n\nI have worked restaurant and service industry jobs for most of my life and buddy i gotta say don't say f*** at a customer is probably rule number one. Quickly followed by don't insult your customer... try to make them happy, quickly followed by make the extra effort for your regulars who are usually generous and have never complained before. I have never even thought don't call the cops on them because they are unhappy with their service was even eligible to be on the list of\nWhat not to do but now im adding it to my list. \n\nSo i told him ok fine go call the cops i would love to speak with them and i tipped the delivery guy a little extra for his having to be party to this and because i felt sorry for him that this a**hole is his boss. Well the cops haven't showed up yet i doubt they will but here is where it gets kinda creepy. The manager called my personal phone with his personal phone to tell me 'now you have my personal number' to which i responded \"I don't need it\" and hung up. so i feel a little threatened personally idk what kinda bad day this guy is having but i wasn't being irate or confrontational in the slightest with this guy at all. I didn't ask for anything free or compensation just simply 'i wont pay for that cause i cant  it sorry\" and now he is threatening me? \n\nIf anyone at Tazza is reading this i hope you realize you just lost a regular over this, that guy is not fit to be doing customer service and no one should be treated that way.",

Since I was in Philadelphia with a friend for the day, I figured I would give it another shot and she may enjoy it. At first I thought to myself that I made a mistake by choosing to go there again. The server that greeted us didn't come back to our table at all, although I ordered a bottle of water. About 15 minutes later, another server named Maddie come over and and said she would be taking care of us. It was obvious that the place was busy and everyone was running around, yet she still took the time to make us feel important by being friendly, courteous and attentive. She was even helping people around her, cleaning tables, and talking to other guests. Maddie, this review is for you! You are amazing at what you do and certainly know how to give more than exceptional service!!! We will definitely be back to see you.",

  "text": "When I heard the name \"Interstate Draft House,\" I thought it was going to be some behemoth-sized bar with a ton of beer options. I couldn't have been more wrong. Interstate is about the size of someone's apartment, and they offer about sixteen drafts. It was like stepping into any laid-back neighborhood bar, and that was just fine with me. \n\nMy cousin, his gf, and I got there for happy hour. It wasn't terribly busy, we were seated right away, and our server was very nice. Happy hour, she explained, meant we could choose some bar snacks at about $3-4 and drafts on the board with a star were only $3. Yes, that's right: THREE DOLLARS FOR A CRAFT BEER DRAFT. Not everything was on special, but even the Rogue Chipotle (which is usually double the price) was included. We each went with different drafts: Dogfish Aprihop, Prism Shady Blond (a very local brew), and Bell's Oberon. \n\nWe ordered beers and food. My cousin ordered the chicken tacos, his gf got the spinach-tomato pizza, and I went with the ancho honey wings. The chicken tacos, though just $2 each, came one per order, so he had to put in another order for a second. The spinach-tomato pie was the perfect personal size and the crust was super thin. It looked a little like a frozen pie, but I couldn't confirm that. My wings didn't have as much of an ancho flavor as I would have liked and weren't spicy. But there were six of them, they were on the larger side, and also came with some carrots/celery/ranch, so for $4 it was a great deal. \n\nGranted, it wasn't very busy, but our server never forgot about us and was ready to bring refills when we needed them. \n\nAll in all, Interstate was a solid pick. I would like to come back and take more advantage of the super-cheap drafts on a day when we aren't busting our asses to get back home before a hockey game. They have two TVs at Interstate, but if you don't get a seat at the bar, you won't be able to see them.\n\n*Also, I'm not familiar with the Philly mass transit so I can't comment on that, but we drove over to save some time and parking was super easy. We actually got a spot right in front of the bar.",

They clearly care about both the quality & quantity they serve which makes them a great choice for their location.  The homemade tortellini should not be passed up, specifically the veal (if you are a veal fan).  \nThe only criticism I have is that some dishes are better served with less pasta - specifically those with specialty sauces (seafood dishes in particular).  The parking lot is also a nightmare but they are making the best of it!\n\nUpdate 7/1/2011\nIf you get pizza get the margherita, its excellent.  We've tried 3 or 4 different soups now, all good.  The eggplant parm is excellent however the veal parm was questionable - it was made with a VEAL PATTY??  This seemed odd to me.",

However, when I think of benedict I think smothered in hollandaise and perfectly poached eggs. This place did neither. The eggs were overcooked so that the yolk was hard, the pesto hollandaise sauce was not impressive and they put only a small amount on top of each egg (it wasn't even enough to cover the egg).

Parking is street parking so don't expect to find parking right next to the place, but there is parking up the street. \n\nOur waiter was amazing, he was really nice and gave up time expectations on our pizza, which was very considerate of him. We had the pretzel appetizer, and the homemade pretzel sticks were soooooo good. The cheese sauce wasn't that great with the pretzel. I wished it was like Auntie Annie's spicy cheese sauce.... but the pretzel alone was yummy and I will definitely order it again.\n\nWe ordered the thin crust pepperoni and sausage pizza. It was a really good pizza for Tennessee. Did it taste like things crust pizzas  I've had in Chicago...which I've had many many times by the way... no its didn't. It wasn't in any way in comparison to the greatness that I've had there, however it's still a pretty yummy pizza. I do think the pepperoni was cut to thick.\n\nThe next time I go I will try the deep dish. I've had it once when I was a kid in Chicago and thought it was really really good...then I was scarred when Pizza Hut came out with a deep dish and I was in Chicago and my dad's best friend wanted to try it and ordered it, and it was horrible.... so I haven't tried any deep dish pizzas since... but I will go back to 312 here in the next couple of weeks and give it a try, because of the reviews on yelp about 312 deep dish.",

Which sucks, because being sexy does not come as naturally as the dirt under my nails. Buuuut the reason why I love this place is because of the Yards Brawler. Before Yards Brawler I was doing shameful things like ordering Snakebite and Bloody Ho's (beers mixed with framboise) and getting MOCKED for it. Now, The Brawler is my go-to order. My friend and I got the sampler pack a couple of years ago when we were young and experimental and it's like finding your favorite pair of jeans that never stretch out. You feel comfortable ordering it and people don't mock you-- in fact they mistake you for liking beer and being the cool down to earth beer chick.\n\nAlso this review is for the COMPANY which rocks a solid A in my books. They do so many things for the Philadelphia community (and beyond) that I love them. I mean this is the site where I've been to the MOST fundraisers oddly enough. haha! Love it!",

The family is friendly, and the service is fast. The place is small, so there are no spaces for groups. \n\nOverall, the best Jewish deli ive been to so far in the area.",

  "text": "PNever in my life did I think I'd be eating at another fast food joint other than In N Out. \n\nMy friend kept on raving about Chik fil A and now I understand why. It's just so fresh, delicious, and guilt free. \n\nOne day I passed by and saw a loooong drive through line and decided to jump on the band wagon. \n\nI was surprised at how fast they were handling business. Pretty impressive being that they just opened. On top of that, every worker I've encountered has been nothing but nice and well informed. \n\nMy favorite sandwich is the #2  spicy deluxe sandwich with Chick fil A sauce. It's so spicy, but in a good way. Eating the juicy spicy chicken patty along with the buns, cheese, tomato, lettuce and sauce is just the best. Everything is incredibly well balanced. \nI mistakenly ordered the regular spicy chicken sandwich without cheese, lettuce and tomato one day and it wasn't nearly as good. \n\nI was surprised at how fresh the chicken was. I could see the moisture after taking a bite out of it, just as when I cook chicken at home fresh from the market.\n\nChick fil A must have the healthiest, tastiest and smartest kid's meals on the planet. The nuggets are fresh and delicious just like their sandwiches. For sides they have great options- applesauce or a fresh fruit cup. Their fruit cup was legit. It had mandarin oranges, blueberries, strawberries and apples and everything was so fresh. I also love their drink options-milk or organic juice. To top things off, they include a fun educational toy such as I spy booklets or pop out assemble yourself animals. Doesn't get any better than that. Finally a fast food place this mom approves of. \n\nDid I mention that they have the best milk shakes ever? I never order milk shakes but they turned me around all right. Seems like they use real ice cream and fresh milk. Their Oreo and vanilla milk shakes are so delicious and refreshing. They use fresh crunchy cookies and  actual vanilla flavor. The thickness and cool mouth feel is just right too. They top them off with whipped cream and a maraschino cherry. \n\nTry all of their sauces!!!! Sooooooo good. The combinations are endless. I like the Chick fil A sauce the most but also like combining the ranch with the zesty buffalo.\n\nI've been here more times than I can count because I'm truly addicted. I talked to many workers at every location I go to and all of them swear by Chick fil A, eating here while they're working and even when they're off the clock. That says a lot.",

There is a Cuban and Dominican in the kitchen so the flavors are very close.  If you've never eaten Cuban / Dominican / Puerto Rican food, take the drive.  It's very good food.   Huge portions.   I don't expect the kitchen to be large and not built for high volume so a group of 15 plus a regular dinner crowd could have caused problems with food delivery.    There were four of us - not as fast as an Applebee's but then again, it's not an Applebees.    Waiters are college kids so they aren't familiar with the different plates available..",

  "text": "I don't like leaving poor reviews for restaurants, but unfortunately this location deserves one. \n\nYou walk in and the only menu you can order from is a folded-up takeout menu that was somewhat greasy from previous patrons. The cashiers were cordial, but problems with the order either fell upon the cashiers taking the order incorrectly or staff making food improperly. \n\nI had multiple people in my party order everything from pizza to sandwiches to the wings and nothing was up to par. We were asked what sauce we wanted on the wings, but when the \"wings\" were served, they gave no sauce. When we asked them to fix it, we were given a dipping cup.\n\nThe sandwich was properly made, but it was somewhat undercooked and fell apart after the first bite. That could be the mark of a juicy sandwich, but in this case it was just shoddily put together.\n\nThe pizza itself was passable, but not terribly great for a namesake dish. The one silver lining had to be the drink machine, which really shouldn't ever be a silver lining for any situation.\n\nThe rest of the atmosphere was fine, if a little strange. There were an abundance of large TVs, but you would think at least one of them would be in Full HD (they aren't). The sliding glass door is always open, but I'm not sure why it was needed to begin with.\n\nI don't know, it just seems like this whole restaurant just won't be worth most people's time. Yes, it really is that bad. Yes, you will probably regret it. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but that's the way Dan cooks his pizza.",

YUM!!! that had a good kick to it (that was the ginger of course! SO VERY GOOD!!) & my honey got The Champ - very good too but no kick (no ginger duh!) :-)  - I dug them both!!\n\nI got the Spanish Breakfast & my honey got the Huevos Rancheros - very good!!

  "text": "Because there was ingenuity behind the plates, I wanted to like the food more but the end result left me puzzled.\n\nThe crawfish hushpuppies were a good idea because they are two wonderful ingredients, but where was the crawfish? The key ingredient was lost and further buried by the overly dark deep frying.\n\nCombining frog legs and bacon with a spicy kick from horseradish and creole remoulade was a good idea, but what's the point of serving frog legs if you're just going to make them taste like chicken. Where is the amphibious funk? Also, be careful while eating because of the bones.\n\nFried pork rinds that popped and crackled when served was a good idea. It sounded great, but tasted like Styrofoam.\n\nTransforming grits into a white cheddar grit cake as a base for the shrimp was a good idea, but why make the exterior skin so thick? Why drown the shrimp and grits in a \"Creole BBQ cream sauce\" that neither tasted Creole nor BBQ? Why use small, flavorless shrimp? To make things worse, the side of southern greens was harshly home-styled to the point they were difficult to eat.\n\nSoaking pasta in alcohol for the \"Drunken Angel\" was a good idea, but why use cheap red wine? The wine wasn't going to cook down. Why use saffron? Saffron is one of the most expensive ingredients in the world. It's something chefs don't waste in a spicy arrabbiata-like sauce that was filled with garlic to the point where the saffron was hardly noticeable. Why put so much bread (a waitress mockingly called it a \"loaf\") on top of the pasta bowl? Not only was it carbs on more carbs, it was flavored like something from the disgusting Olive Garden (which doesn't realize that olives grow on trees in groves, not in gardens). Granted, there was good flavor from the crawfish and lobster broth, but why use so much cream sauce, again? And to top it all off, the pasta was overcooked and mushy.\n\nGastropubs frequently have smaller food items or \"bites\". No need to worry about not getting enough food here. The plates are plenty big so you don't \"parish\". Basically, don't order more than two plates per person.\n\nDespite the repeated use of ginger ale, mint, and cucumber infused liquors when cucumbers aren't in season, the best thing about The Parish was the cocktails and the main thing saving the place from 2-stars. The Caribbean Mule was clearly the top drink of the night with its cold brightness.\n\nTucson is a town so small they get confused when I give a phone number. They don't expect the area code or The Parish doesn't expect many out-of-towners. The clientele also seemed confused where silly parents celebrate their infant's birthday with the baby in tow. Who does that? This is a gastropub, not a Chuck E. Cheese. Service was not properly coordinated between staff members.",

I wasn't disappointed and would go back here again. I didn't go inside because it was pretty packed. When we first got there no seats were available.

We picked a spot by the window. We immediately received menus and our drink order was taken. Tea for me, Vietnamese coffee for hubby. Our order was taken very quickly, and drinks arrived soon after.\n\nWe got an order of 4 spring rolls to share, decent flavour, but curious that there was no chilli garlic sauce on the table. We made do with sriracha and chilli oil. No biggie.\n\nHubby ordered the pork & spring roll vermicelli bowl. Also curious was the fact that the noodles were served warm in this dish, as they've been served cold every other time he's ordered this dish elsewhere. Don't get me wrong, this wasn't a bad thing, the warm noodles actually elevated the flavours in this dish. The grilled pork was excellent as well. Yum!\n\nI ordered a regular P1 w/no tripe and extra tendon. The soup was good, flavourful broth, tasty meatballs...but I did not receive the extra tendon I asked for (I have no problem paying extra for this if required). There were 3 tasty, but small pieces in there. One other thing, the noodles seemed to be freshly cooked rather that pre-cooked and added after. A small but nice touch. \n\nOnce our food arrived, we had no other interaction with any staff other than when we got up to pay. No one asked how our meal was, no one brought us the bill. Almost like we were a nuisance, bordering on feeling like we'd been dismissed. Ok, so no warm fuzzies here. \n\nGood food, hot soup, chilly service.",

But last week we went back and got the steak and pasta special and it was pretty good so we thought we would try it again this week. Well we went Wesenday night and my husband and son both asked for no tomatoes in their pasta dish but both got them and it called for onions and they didn't get them but we didn't say anything. And then on Thursday the every next day I got an email about the pasta and steak special which included a drink. Well I guess this was our last time here..the 1st steak they gave my son was nothing but fat he couldn't even cut it so the brought him another one but it was cold and raw. Sp the manager came over and I told her about the night before az well..so she said she would take off 2 meals but when the waitress brought our bill she charged us for 3 cokes almost $9 I said No the drinks were part of the combo . So took the bill to the manager who came back and rudely sat it down kn our table but still charged us for one coke because the deal was 10.99 and she charged $10.00 and then $2.89 for one coke and also charged$2.49 for my sons salad which any other time would have been fine but since he had to send to steaks back. Like I said we have been going here since they opened.",

  "text": "Sad. Prep & Pastry started out fabulous, but the last two times I've been there, the pork and turkey sausages were under-cooked, potatoes tasted more of old olive oil and the center of the biscuits--cold. And the redone seating was not thought through. Large table placed in a large alcove that doubles as a \"bandshell\" for table talk which gets inadvertently amplified out into the restaurant making it almost impossible to hear your table mates or the waiter. Two seater tables placed so close to each other that the waiter has to assume the child's pose to service either table.  And lastly, being told that payments take place at the table after waiting in line at the cash register-- which I guess is just part of the decor--not a place to make payment for food? Ah well. It was nice while it lasted.",

  "text": "This new Tunisian-based BYO is a complete makeover of the Thai operation formerly here. The new decor is awash in soft, light blue (what else?) executed with exceptional taste. The overall effect is delightfully romantic, especially for Doylestown, which can use something \"date night\" like this even though the mellow vibe was diminished by a bright sconce light over our table.\n\nThe owners are obviously anxious to please, and could hardly do more to make folks feel welcome. We were warmly greeted, well taken care of throughout, and even given a complimentary after-dinner degustation.\n\nOur appetizers -- octopus and a meatball special -- were absolutely spectacular, fully worthy of a great restaurant. The latter was spicy in the best sense, with heat used to enhance flavor using a delectable mix of herbs and spices from the owner's mother in Tunisia.\n\nWere the meal to end there, Blu would qualify for a major detour and a solid five stars. Alas, the warhorse mains -- lamb couscous and moussaka -- were ordinare, albeit using superior quality lamb and other ingredients. Couscous was too dry and lacking in flavor complexity, while moussaka came off as little more than pleasant comfort food. If you want worthy moussaka hereabouts, try someplace like Philly's Estia.\n\nThe dessert of superior baklava and dates fared much better except for tiny portion size. If you're more than a nibbler, you're better off walking down the block to excellent Nina's or even Nonno's.\n\nThe owner has had long experience as a chef, and given the investment he's made appears to be playing it safe and predictable with menu offerings. Yet, he obviously has talent worthy of much greater things, so in time the main courses may expand to approach the quality and creativity of the apps we enjoyed. In the meantime, best bet is probably to steer clear of predictable menu choices and spring instead for the specials.\n\nWorth mentioning is how clean this place is, and not only to the eye. We noticed that when a table was cleared off where a family with children had been, the floor area around that table was also wiped down.\n\nWe got out for under $45/person, plus tip and wine.",

However, I drove past it the first time I visited, so keep your eyes peeled. It shares the same space as some nondescript business. \n\nI'm glad that the space is a lot bigger and they now have plenty of parking, even at peak times. The food, menu, and staff are the same. I came in for lunch a few times recently, and if you go early, you are golden. Anywhere between 11-12:00 you are fine. However, I stopped in around 12:30 and the line was long and order taking a bit annoying. I also waited about 15 minutes for my order, so it's not the quickest lunch option out there. When ordering take out, I like for it to be pretty quick, but expect to be at Phat Bites for at least 30 minutes at peak times. \n\nI still love the black bean burger that they offer. It's the best one I've had. I also have ordered a few sides. The kale salad is always great, and the hummus is out of this world! Phat Bites is amazing, so check them out!",

  "text": "Today a coworker and I decided to visit this restaurant for lunch and it was the first for both of us. Yelp showed great reviews but unfortunately it was not what we expected. We ordered burgers and I had a half caesar salad. The burgers were served to us very quickly which was impressive, however the burgers were no larger than a hockey puck and no thicker than the width of two McDonald's cheeseburger patties. Initially the sandwich looked great with artisan ciabatta bread, but the bread was humongous in relation to the little piece of meat that were considered burgers. They should have been served as sliders but were not. Regardless I just ate the pieces of meat and cut off small pieces of the bread for my meal. Now... the caesar salad is served and it immediately looked unappetizing. The lettuce was wilted but I still attempted to eat the salad. After three bites I realized that this salad was not good, and it definitely did not taste like caesar dressing. \n\nAt this point I felt that I had dealt with enough with the burger, so I asked the server to return the salad because I was not satisfied with it. The server quickly returned and explained to my coworker and I that his manager had yelled at him because I returned the salad. Moreover he stated that his manager did not want to refund the salad of $4 and would like to speak with me as to why I did not want the salad. This perplexed me and was counter to the service that I expected. \n\nAs I reached the counter to explain that I no longer wanted the salad, the owner did not ask me what was wrong with the salad as I expected for constructive feed-back. Instead the owner asked me what would I like in place of the salad. I stated that I did not want anything at all, but just wanted a refund of the $4 dollars. The owner immediately slammed down his fist on the counter in front of my coworker and I, and then refunded the cost. \n\nFor this and previous reasons, especially how he treated his young employee, we will NOT EVER visit this establishment again. You do not treat your employees like crap, and definitely not your customers. Let alone as an owner show physical hostility toward your customers because they were not happy with a meal that you served. This is unacceptable and should not be tolerated. \n\nUnfortunately in our society there is far too much anger and physical violence in the workplace, and many other places that the community frequents. I am not labeling this owner but I could not help but to take a step back when the physically aggressive act occurred. \n\nBecause of today's violence throughout our society, it is very important that we pay attention to the signs wherever we are. We must stay vigilant and do our part to bring attention to potential incidents all around us. It is our duty to our communities and to one another.\n\nFor this reason the owner's physical act of anger immediately caught my attention. I pray that I am overthinking this but better safe than sorry and if you ever frequent this establishment, tread lightly if you ask for a refund.\n\nSigned,\n\nVery unfortunate experience",

After what seemed a longer than average wait time we asked where our food was.  the server said it's coming soon.  The kicker was the table that sat well after us, got their food first.   Then when our food arrived and we asked for ketchup and mustard. It was \"dropped\" on our table. We weren't impressed at all.   I wouldn't go back.",

Far from being convenient, it's proximity to a major intersection in town makes it a bit tricky to get to from some directions. Since I was coming from the west, I had to enter via the CVS lot. However, I noticed some people driving the wrong way around the lot to get where they needed to be and that could be dangerous.\n\nThe food here is pretty much average for the fast food chain. Service was actually pretty good. I didn't like that most of the chairs in the dining area were hard. (So it seems I'm getting old. :) ) However, the dining area and restrooms appear to be renovated not too long ago and are in good condition. One downside is there is no self-serve beverage area, so you'll have to ask for refills at the counter.",

They have a particular treat served in a shot glass that combines espresso, caramel, and salt, and it will absolutely wake you up.  You can buy their signature blend, affectionately named Road Rage, while in the small shop.  They also serve up some snacks if you need a pick-me-up while shopping about the many adorable shops in Marathon.  It was without a doubt some of the best coffee I have ever had.  I would not recommend this as a coffee house for sitting and doing homework, as its too small, but I would recommend picking up a cup from here on your way to run errands.  You will have the most productive day ever hyped up on this incredibleness.",

Normally I hate fruit in my food, but the pineapple is subtle and really compliments the calamari and shrimp.  You eat it over little shrimp crackers.

Despite its sort of 70's, bronze window frame, stucco exterior, the interior is very well designed, simple but not boring, and very clean.  The service is kind and our waiter had the perfect balance of friendliness and professionalism.  The food was very pretty and mine was quite tasty.  I had a salad of red and yellow beets with almonds, arugula, and a goat cheese mousse.  I am a Vegetarian.  There were many other intriguing dishes on the menu but I am also a beet freak so this was a no- brainer.  I just loved it. There could have been a little more of the mousse, but that is just quibbling.  My partner, however, ordered the Cobb Salad, which was advertised as having grilled chicken, but had shredded chicken, which was unexpected and disappointing. The breadsticks which were offered in lieu of bread tasted like baked yeast with salt, and some bland olive oil was placed on our table in little saucers to cut the salinity.  The other people at our table were very happy with their food, but another of our party said it wasn't what she expected when she ordered and didn't sound too happy about it.  I don't live in the area so I don't know what restaurants cost there but the prices seemed reasonable, maybe a tad on the high side, but I didn't mind because I was expecting the southern Italian food that I usually encounter.  If I ever find myself in Wilmington again (it is a lovely town and the museum is a jewel) I would gladly return for another meal.",

There were 'only' 3 tables of customers in the place and 2 at the bar.  There were 'only' two servers working.  'One' server gave us a menu, the 'other' got us 'our' drinks.  Then we sat for 20 minutes until I asked if we could place an 'order'.  Another painful 30 minutes went by and 'out' came 'our' food.\n\nThis was my second time there.  The first time my food was 'OK' as far as bar food goes.  This second time, the food was just meh. It was very salty and tasted like it was defrosted.\n\n'On' the positive side, there were a tons of TVs and a good selection of beer so if I went back, it would be 'only' to watch a sporting event I couldn't 'otherwise' get on my cable network.  'Otherwise', I wouldn't go back just to eat.  Skip it.",

When we arrived to the restaurant, the table was set and ready, and the restaurant was pretty empty. \n\nThe service started out good, but slowly took a turn for the worst. When the bread was brought out I had to ask multiple different waiters for butter before they decided to bring it out. The staff didn't seem to pay attention to our drink refill needs. At one point the hostess filled our drinks- and got the cups mixed up so I ended up with a diet coke that tasted like ice tea-ew. \n\nThe food is reasonably  priced and there is an okay selection. All of our meals were pretty good too. I had the mushroom raviolis, tasted great and was very filling.  \n\nThe quality of the food cannot trump the bad service I last experienced. I don't think I will be going back anytime soon- there are plenty of other reasonably priced BYOB Italian restaurants with better service in the area.",

  "text": "I'd definitely say it's worth making a first-time trip, but I'm not sure I'd come again unless it was to try brunch or hang out on the outdoor portion of the restaurant. I love the concept of eating on a boat; eating is one of the most enjoyable and frequent activities that I engage in, and it's fun to switch up the atmosphere a little bit every once in awhile. \n\nThat being said, the boat was hauntingly quiet, kind of dark, and just generally somber on the evening that my boyfriend and I dined here. I can't speak to whether or not this is the norm, as it was a frigid Tuesday night in the middle of winter. \n\nDrinks were good, the St. James Lemonade was bomb. \n\nFood was definitely a little above average, but expensive. I'd definitely recommend scooping a Living Social deal if you see one.\n\nWe shared:\n\n-Crab mac n' cheese\n-Philadelphia roll\n-Brussels sprouts\n-Braised short rib gnocchi\n\nThe portions weren't huge, but we ended up having to take home a small box of mac and a few pieces of sushi because we were full. Everything was good, but the mac and sprouts were my favorites.\n\nIt happened to be my birthday, and our (really friendly & helpful) waitress brought out a complimentary scoop of sorbet with a candle in it at the end of the meal. \n\nOverall, it was a nice, quiet evening with solid food, but you're definitely paying a premium to be eating on the river.",

The food is incredible, I have yet to try something I haven't liked. \n\nMy wife, 3 kids and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and had an incredible dining experience. Our server was fantastic, while we were deciding what dessert to order, she took the time to take our kids over to the gelato and help them pick a flavour. \n\nI see several people complaining about the slow service, this has not been my experience. I can agree that the staff is a little laid back, but you kind of expect that when you are eating at an organic hipster restaurant don't you? \n\nThe only reason I would hesitate on giving this place 5 stars is because it is a little pricy for the amount of food you get. However being that it is an organic, locally sourced restaurant, you can't expect to pay a little more for your food. So 5 stars all the way. \n\nIf you are looking for a high quality meal, and have the time to enjoy it... this is your place. If you don't have the time, buy a sub at subway or a burger at McDonalds and avoid having to leave a bad review on yelp for a restaurant that is clearly not what you were looking for.",

They had a special menu for the holiday. This meant higher prices. We shared the Caprese Salad which was very good. Nice large chunks of fresh mozz. My wife had the Ravioli Bellini which she said was great. I had the salmon florentine which I highly recommend. They did a great job hustling out orders of food during the busy evening. The only issue was poor waiter service from Vincenzo. He may have checked on us twice all night if that. We not only ran out of drinks, but also out of water. How bad to have the \"water girl\" walking around an pass us up with 4 empty glasses in front of us. We were able to flag her down to get not only water, but silverware to eat our food with. I guess Vincenzo thought we'd use our hands. The food was great, the service was marginal. The host staff and bar staff were very good.",

Bread was served with our order too. The place is a little small (we were put in the corner even though we were the only ones there at first...), but music and food are totally authentic.

  "text": "I've heard tons of good things about Prep & Pastry, so when my fiance and I drove by last Sunday morning, I suggested we stop for brunch.\n\nWhen we walked in, the hostess said it would be about a 45 minute wait, but she wasn't sure since some people had left without telling her. Looking around the restaurant, there were quiet a few empty tables, and there didn't seem to be too many people waiting, so I was slightly confused. But since we weren't in a rush or grungry (the anger of being overly hungry), we decided to wait.\n\nLuckily, we had only been sitting outside for about 15 minutes when our name was called. The interior is super cute! I really liked the high ceilings and how bright the restaurant was. It was definitely the perfect atmosphere for a lazy Sunday brunch.\n\nAfter much deliberation, we finally made our decisions and ordered.  I ordered the breakfast poutine and my fiance had the chx + toast (fried chicken strips, rosemary brioche french toast, and a blueberry syrup). My poutine was just okay. It was a solid portion, but kind of bland, and I definitely didn't see any cheese curds. On the other hand, my fiance loved his dish! I thought the different components sounded weird on paper, but once I had a bite, I was sold! The chicken was flavorful, and the rosemary french toast was the perfect savory accompaniment, but I do wish it was a little less soggy. However, I did think the chicken was on the dry side.\n\nAlthough we didn't have room to sample their pastries, they all looked amazing. I will definitely be trying one on my next visit.\n\nI think overall, I would give Prep & Pastry 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding it up to 4 since I think I would be happier if I got a different dish next time. Also, I don't think the wait would be so bad on most weekends, but the Sunday we went was super windy, so I don't think many people wanted to sit outside.",

Order nachos and have them add your favorites... It's pretty darn good! Lol",

  "text": "The food was absolutely delicious! We were visiting New Orleans on a trip and we actually found this place on yelp. We came in thinking it was a little restaurant, however it turned out to be a bar that served food on the side.  The problem with that was since we were expecting to dine in, the bar was wanting to charge us a $10 cover fee per person in order to stay on the place..which wasn't what we were expecting. The live music seemed good though, but we ended up getting our food to go to bring back to our hotel.  The Kitchen was out of their wings and ribs (which happened to be their top seller). But the brisket and pulled pork was still delicious. We wish we had ordered more because one order was definitely not enough to share. Be sure to try out all their BBQ sauces.",

A place like this absolutely needs to nail this dish, and it falls totally flat.  A bunch of tiny pieces of fish instead of large and flaky filets and they are overbreaded. Maybe some of the worst fish and chips I've ever had.",

  "text": "I had been to Cava 3 times before, once in 1998, once in 2004, and once in 2009. Although there are some drawbacks to living with my parents after graduating from college, they do regularly take me out to dinner with them (score!). Saturday night was my choice of restaurants and I decided that Cava was calling my name.\n\nI love using OpenTable for reservations whenever I can so it was great to find out that Cava was part of OpenTable. We had reservations for 8:15pm and were seated immediately in the back of the restaurant, close to the bar, fireplace, and fantastic live musician. She gave off a blues/jazz vibe, my dad and I thought it was a recording she was so good. The environment here is super relaxing and mellow, exactly what we want on our mini-vacation. \n\nThe bottomless chips and salsa (one red salsa and one black bean salsa) arrive when you sit down, yum yum yum! All 3 of us had a REALLY difficult time deciding what we wanted because Cava has a fabulous menu, especially for those who love seafood. Our waiter was great, I didn't get his name, but he wasn't shy about recommending his favorites and what other people seem to enjoy. We started off with their most popular appetizer; ceviche. Los Agaves does have a large order of ceviche, but I preferred the one at Cava because it was served with their delicious fresh guacamole and pico de gallo to balance out the spicy lime flavor of the fresh halibut.\n\nI ordered the Rock Shrimp Soft Tacos (Papaya salsa, sour cream & handmade corn tortillas), my dad got the Oven Braised Lamb Shanks with Toasted Orzo (slowly cooked with port wine & garlic), and my mom got the Fajitas with shrimp, scallops, and Mahi-Mahi. All three of us were thrilled with our selections, my tacos were easily the best tacos I've ever had. Their white corn tortillas provide a perfect base to the battered shrimp and the papaya salsa was phenomenal.\n\nOur waiter also recommended the Carne Asadea a la tampiquena, which I may try next time.\n\nValet is complimentary (SWEET)!\n\nWe'll DEFINITELY be back here.",

I also ordered a cup of potato broccoli soup, which looked like neither, but was tasty nonetheless. For dinner, I had a bacon and blue cheese burger with sweet potato fries. The burger was huge and savory. Realized it was a BYOB while I was there, which is always a plus. It was steady business around 6:30pm on a Tuesday. The server was a little odd and slow with refilling our sodas, but that's about the only complaint I had. All of the food was magnificent and the atmosphere was enjoyable.

Surprise! This time it appeared with mushrooms.\n\nOur waitress was clearly trying her best which did not go unnoticed, but it was hard to remain pleased as we were forced to continually send back food.\n\nEventually we spoke to a manager who placed the blame on us. We argued that we were very clear in dietary accommodations. Although we should not have assumed the Pad Thai was vegan, fish oil is not something this dish typically (or ever in my experience) calls for.\n\nThe restaurant was also quite cold and I was shivering by the end of this 2 hour ordeal.\n\nWill not be returning.",

We were four of us meeting there for what we thought and expected to be a great experience. The waiter first told us that small plates were no longer available in the dining room. He offered us to move to the front room. We refused and decided to order from the menu. \n\nWe requested a bottle of sparkling bottle if badoit. It did not arrive. We had to ask 3 times. One person ordered the special smoked duck appetizer and the beet salad, another the smoked duck appetizer, the third the coquille st Jacques and the fourth a house salad and The bouillabaisse   \n\nOne salad arrived. Bread came afterward. Bread was at least one day old and re heated. The second salad did not come. We had to ask for it twice. We are French and we know bouillabaisse. It's a fish and seafood tomato based soup. The bouillabaisse that was served had no broth, it had 2 little pieces of white fish, 2 shrimp and 4 mussels. We told the server that it was not a bouillabaisse. He did not seem to know what is a bouillabaisse. We requested to speak with Gordon and were told that he was busy in the kitchen training a cook. \n\nIn the past, Gordon used to come to our table to inquire how our meal was and chat with us in French. Not tonight. \n\nOther patrons seemed to have complaints as well according to the way they addressed the waiters and waitress. \n\nToo bad! It was awful!!\nWe were expecting an enjoyable meal as usual but it was really bad. We won't go there again",

It came on a bun that was soft enough to pull apart easily.  When I did so the levels stayed together.  The texture and taste of both the sandwich and the slighly curried potato salad side were good.  I found myself enjoying the overall experience and reluctant to leave.  A good value at less than $10.",

The place is tiny and simple inside, just a dozen tables. But it's quaint. The sandwiches, the soup, the potato salad and coleslaw are all the best around. You seriously cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. The Smoked Chicken Salad is great, the Big Bad Wolf, the Layton...all amazing. You get a decent sized sandwich of quality ingredients and amazing flavor combinations. Even the simplest club is unique and delicious. They have a very limited vegetarian selection, just a couple of items to choose from. I don't think they have many desserts, I've just seen a little basket of brownies on the counter. It's basically just sandwiches. You order at the counter, get your fountain drink and they bring you your food.",

  "text": "My boyfriend and I have driven by twice place since it's been opened and never stopped in until today. \nI ordered a baby back rib sandwich with a side salad and my boyfriend had a Monte Cristo Mac and cheese bbq tri-tip sandwich with a side of Mac and cheese. When we walked in we weren't sure what to expect. Their menu was nice, interesting take on the vegan choices. We were greeted by the owner, we ate in, and then our server was a young girl (early teens), she seemed to know what she was doing but was very awkward. Now I'm really not a fan of BBQ at all, unless I make it myself or I'm eating at Goodwood. I was really disappointed by the portion sizes, but was satisfied with the meat quality (I am the pickiest meat eater). \nTheir Mac & Cheese alone is worth going there for, but I'm not a fan of their entree's or choices. Their food is INCREDIBLY rich and made me sick for 3 days with only consuming half my meal (which isn't very big to begin with). Their salad looked like they had pulled it out of a $.99 bag of iceberg lettuce and put it in a bowl. I know it's a side salad but I'd like more to it!\nOverall, I'm not a fan. I didn't try their Vegan selection but I would contemplate going back. But between the OK service and the way I felt for three days after, that would be a hard bargain.",

  "text": "If it was possible to give a place zero stars I would. As one of the only places uptown to get a good chopped salad, Fresh Bar has a lot of potential. That potential is completely destroyed by their unbelievably atrocious service. I have been here many times, each time hoping for a better experience, and each time disappointed. Not only do they have 1 person working at a time (not just making the salads, but literally one person working in the entire building going back and forth from the kitchen), but there have been several times I have come in and no one has been there at all. I knock on the kitchen door and the \"employees only\" door, but no one comes out so i have been just left alone in the restaurant. Not only is this stupid for their purposes - who's to say I wouldn't steal? - but it is actually comical to think you can run a business with no one working. Today I came in and waited over an hour for a simple salad because there was only one woman working and having to go back and forth from the kitchen. She also was literally not wearing pants. This place would be run better if it was run by toddlers. I am genuinely shocked that this place is still open.",

I figured the soup and the seafood Bastille would be enough for me; watching my weight and all that. We were approached by the waiter when we walked in and even though the place had only 2 other tables filled, he still asked us if we had a reservation. That sleighs me. Anyway, The soup was delicious; tomato with lentils, chick peas and spices.. delish! My partner ordered the chicken Bastille; but i make it a point to never order chicken at restaurants. I tasted it but it wasn't great and really sweet. My seafood Bastille wasn't much better but it did the job. Great ambiance and music. The waiter was not very good.

  "text": "The restaurant is in the heart of ambler borough. It's a small but chic restaurant that let's you bring your own wine(byo). Yay. Time to break out some cheap wine! But that's okay because Massa's great selection of food in various portions will impress you enough that the wine you brought will be nothing but delicious. (unless it's a bad wine, jokes on you, I guess) \nWe walked in pretty late on a Friday night but our server was really welcoming and fabulous. We had the tuna carpaccio and octopus as starters then scallops and chicken for main course. The carpaccio was great with avocado and hints of pepper and sea salt. The octopus...I loved it. The whole concoction with choriço(sp?) sausage plus potatoes plus bean sauce was really delicious. The main dishes were also delicious but wasn't the best scallops or chicken I have ever had. Still, it was very very very sososososo delicious. \n\nService was also phenomenal, as the server gave beautiful and accurate descriptions of all dishes we inquired him about. Ice bucket was brought out upon arrival for our white wine and he kindly told us to take our time even after the closing time. Granted, there was another table in the restaurant that was full on drunk and stuck around until we left. Such tragedy, I tell you. \n\nAnyways, I can't wait to return soon enough. \n\nP.S. They serve warm, soft dinner roll with whipped butter!!! What can I say? It was inevitable that I immediately fell in love.",

Not because the food or service was bad, but because I walked in at 9pm (there published closing is 10pm), and unbeknownst to me, just beat the manager locking the door. I asked for a table and the hostess suggested the bar, which I declined. She the said, \"Let me see if the kitchen is still open.\" It was and she gave me a snotty look and seated me. I then heard the manager tell the kitchen, \"We had another guy sneak in\". I ordered their chili and a Caesar's salad, and the House Old Fashioned. The brisket in the chili had never seen smoke and was a bit fatty; if they don't use a bottled dressing for the salad, they should. If they do use a bottled dressing, they should switch. It was so overpowered by mayonnaise it was inedible. And the drink was too-too-too sweet. The waitress was great, and I tipped accordingly.",

I ran down the stairs and revved up the engine to my motor vehicle then I skirt skirted to my destination without Siri if you are wandering cuz Siri has been underperforming lately or I just cannot follow directions.  So at this particular bread co they had a drive thru so I thought to myself how beast of a driver I am just like the queen of NASCAR Danica Patrick.  Finally my turn and roll up to the window and order a bagel pack with two tubs of creamy cream cheese.  I assume the cream cheese came from a magestic cow with the finest raw milk utter to bucket, in short the cream cheese was not the problem.  The slicing of the bagels were.  I asked for the bagels to be cut I half and one of my bagels was not.  An innocent French toast bagel was sliced so horribly I began to cry as if the bagel had been told Natalie Wood is dead.  Natalie Wood was just amazing in West Side Story, so all y'all haters back off Natalie Wood she is a talented beast.  But back to he bagel, it was cut short just like scarlet Johansson's hair in her new movie (roasted).  In conclusion Bread co cut your bagels better.",

Considering it was a Saturday night around 6:30, I thought this place would be packed but there was hardly anyone there. Because of that, we were seated right away. Everyone is nice enough, but was obvious that they weren't exactly thrilled to be there.\n\nThey had 2 for 1 margaritas so we both opted to get a couple of those. And the mix they use is so strange tasting. It's really sweet but tastes like they dumped a bunch of salt in it to balance out the sweetness, but it just didn't work at all. I opted to get the chicken flautas and they were decent. Not the best I've ever had but not terrible either. My fiance got some kind of burrito, can't really remember, and he thought it was just alright.\n\nThis is pretty standard fare in any of the Americanized type Mexican restaurants. Fairly cheap, ok quality, kind of eh service. This is the first Mexican place we've been to in the area, so not sure if there is anything else to substitute, but I'm sure if I looked I could find some place that I'd rather go to.",

  "text": "Luke was the best dinner I had on my recent trip to NOLA, and was a great counterpoint to the previous night's experience at Cochon.\n\nThis won't be a comparative review, but the two evenings were a study in contrasts. I was equally excited for each dinner, but all the anticipation I had for Cochon led to a bit of a letdown, whereas Luke delivered with excellence.\n\nWe were seated immediately after arrival (8:30pm Saturday reservation), and my friends all ordered the highly-recommended mint julep. They were well made and universally praised.\n\nSoup course was 3 for gumbo, and 1 for corn and crab chowder. Everyone was happy, and the gumbo was probably the best we had in the city.\n\nDinner topped the soup course well. The hamburger was as large as advertised, and had a fantastic rich, char-grilled flavor. The fries were a treat as well. I had the duck breast and absolutely loved it. Cooked well, with great combinations of sweet and salty flavors. The nightly special of rabbit was also very tasty, and shrimp and grits were wonderful too. I'd love to gush about the food, but hopefully you've stopped reading this review and have already ordered your food at Luke.\n\nAs for dessert - we all got it, and we all liked it. Bread pudding was a touch too sweet, which made it unfinishable, although it was very good. My friend enjoyed the crepes, but I didn't sample them. The pot de creme was among the best I've ever had (better than my homemade!). Creme brulee was equally good, and notable was that it was served only slightly-chilled, letting the vanilla flavor really sing. \n\nJust go. Enjoy it. Order well, and savor!",

I usually take the potatoes home because I can't eat them all, and I'm a big dude, so that's saying something.

We like their beer and have usually gotten good meals there, too. We sat at the bar. $3 beers-yay! Scott made sure our evening was was enjoyable. From advice about beer choices to making sure our meals were prepared properly. We appreciate his efforts. We shared the Bavarian pretzel and Fondu. It was very good. My husband enjoyed his salmon and my steak salad was delicious. Thanks for a good dinner.",

But don't be put off by these two choices-  there is something for everyone and all is outstanding!  Food could not be better, and the flatbread choice of the day is great- one night it was steak and another night featured duck.\n\nBut don't try to go there for Happy Hour.  The service is abominable.  They have the same person trying to bar tend and wait tables.  One time we waited so long for service, we finally flagged someone down.  We waited another 10 min without success and I finally got up to talk to the hostess-  and it turned out that the waiter/tress was doing an interview!  In the middle of Happy Hour (5:30pm).  What are they thinking? \nAnother night the waiter was kind enough but had no clue about the specials, menu etc and was trying to serve too many tables. \n\nIf the management would only staff the bar appropriately (can't they even hire a college student to bar tend a few hours in the evening when things are busy?), this would be one of my favs.",

  "text": "This chain Mexican spot is a solid choice for family dining, most adventurous eaters might prefer to look elsewhere though. The chain was started by 2 Mexican natives in 1994, and has spread throughout the east coast with over 30 locations now. It is definitely better than other similar corporate Mex places.\n\nA groupon brought us here, and for an easy and economical family meal we were pleased. We liked the large space that had a more open feel than many south of the border shops that we find ourselves in. A sign at the entrance advertised some drink specials, when I saw $2 for a 16oz Dos Equis, I knew that would be what I was drinking. The menu was fairly large with most of the usual suspects, but also some more Americanized plates. Even a good selection of kid's meals.\n\nWe started with table made guac, you can tailor it to your own taste and the avocados were good and mostly ripe. But if you prefer it creamier as we do, you might want to specify from the start. The chips were not to my liking, definitely from a bag, I did like the salsa though. Both kids liked their choices, and we even had to order more beef tacos for the pickier of the two.\n\nTrish ordered seafood chimis, but unfried. She liked but I thought they had a fake seafood flavor. She didn't think she would order again. I had chicken chimis fried of course, and I was happy with the choice. The chicken was tender and nicely seasoned, tortillas nice and crispy, with just a little bit of cheese sauce. I added salsa and jalapeños to up the spice level. The sides of rice and beans were both pretty good too. We ended the meal with something the kids were not expecting, churros. 3 of us really liked them, warm and crispy with cinnamon sugar on the outside and caramel in the middle, plus a little container with even more to be drizzled on them at our will.\n\nEven without the groupon the prices seemed pretty fair. With it we felt like thieves. Service was friendly and quick throughout, but they appear to do quite a business on a Saturday night, so plan for that. Armed with another groupon and the kids, we would probably return. On our own, probably not. 3.5 is there such a thing as an authentic chain Yelps",

They basically put no vegan cheeze on it - it didn't even cover the pizza or the toppings or anything, but was like a few sparse sprinkles here in there. It looked as if they had come across the last bit in the bag and just tried to spread it out to make it cover one pizza when it really couldn't even cover a quarter of it.\n\nWe won't be back again. We found out Panago Pizza has vegan options that are much better and actually give you lots of Daiya cheeze on your pizza - like a real pizza should!\n\nRevamp your vegan pizzas and we'll consider coming back. But you've got a lot of competition with Panago, especially considering all of their healthy, delicious vegan pizza options.",

I am a nacho connoisseur and these paled in comparison to Drifter's BBQ nachos. They were served on hard, greasy and overcooked homemade potato chips, with movie-theater cheese sauce (actually, most theaters have better) with all the slimy fat parts of the pork and very little meat. Its like they gave me all the \"waste parts\" and thought I wouldn't notice under the mounds of cheese and tomato. I rarely waste food but I barely ate any of it. The atmosphere is cool and the people are friendly but don't go for the food. I won't be back.",

Keep in mind it was the same employee every time but we are too skeeved out to ever go back.\n1) The employee didn't know the menu and when I asked about a topping instead of finding out the answer he lied about it.  Had it been an allergen I was asking about the outcome could have been tragic.\n2) He was rude and not friendly at all.  He acted as if we were bothering him.\n3) All the tables were dirty and sticky.\n4) We watched the same employee clean the bathroom then without washing his hands (I had my eyes on him the whole time) went to the front counter and brought us our food. Gross!!!\n5) While the manager was refunding our money I saw the bucket filled with cleaner and water that they use to wipe the tables down with and it had stuff floating in it and filmy layer that was thick and gross looking.\nI would avoid this location because it is a public health nightmare! The manager did give us coupons which I will use but I'll be visiting the Centerton Rd. location in Moorestown.",

I got the peach sangria which was GREAT! \n\nAppetizers:\nThe calamari was good. And the chicken spicy soup was great. Not very spicy, but good.\n\nDinner:\nI got the linguine pescatore. It was ok, not spicy and very bland. Needed alot salt and pepper. Will not order again.\nMy hubby got the salmon with mashed garlic potatoes and broccoli. NOT good. The salmon was ok, but undercooked. The mashed potatoes were not good. The broccoli reminded you of frozen broccoli. \n\nOverall the staff were very good and very accommodating. Gabby was our server and perfect! She was a 10!\n\nSince my hubby wasn't pleased with his meal the remade his meal and gave us generous discount.",

  "text": "NPS = 4\n\nExcruciatingly slow service.\n\nIt took us an hour and 15 mins from the moment we ordered to get our food.  It was unacceptable.\n\n\n\nThe food itself was good, however.  The duck and hash was rich and had wonderful texture/flavor.\n\nThe bread pudding was also sweet to the tongue with the strong yet not overpowering taste of brown sugar.\n\nThe restaurant is right next to Jackson Square and they do have live music (a cello, a guitar and trumpet).  But sadly, the slow service just knocks this place off my list of places to visit.  The worst part is they told our party we had to be present at the time of our reservation or we would be charged.  We held our end of the bargain but Muriel's decided to not hold up to their's in providing a great dining experience.",

The delivery is quicker to my work, although to be fair they are a bit quicker. The customer service, fair warning, is no nonsense. They may not dress you up but they give you your food not a moment later after it's done. And that's personally what I like for my pizza joint.\n\nSauce? Robust.\nCheese? Melty gooey and yummy.\nPepperoni? Nice and spicy.\n\nGranted I haven't had the WHOLE menu, but if you just like your pizza with cheese and pepperoni, this is the best place to have it at.",

The jambalaya was not too spicy, totally just right.  The side order was a perfect amount.  The gumbo was my fav.  My only complaint was that there were a couple pieces of shrimp tail in the broth.  Not a huge deal but the only reason I didn't give them a straight 5.  Everything was delicious and the staff was super friendly.  Chef Ron even came out to greet me to ask how everything was and chatted everyone up. Lots of locals in the place which is always a good sign.  Definitely worth a stop in if you're in the area.",

Food was good but even for a \"small plates\" place, portions on food and drink were just a little parsimonious.  Cheese plate was excellent.  Waitstaff very good and knowledgeable, and while I don't mind being reminded that portions are small, I dread restaurants where I'm told that \"we recommend sharing the plates.\"  It's like dictating culture...I guess we can figure that out for ourselves, once we know the size of the plates.\n\nThese are not huge criticisms; this place is very good already and can be great!",

  "text": "Have been wanting to try this place since it opened and was sadly disappointed.It is located in the back of the space where Borders used to be. Came here on a late night looking to grab a quick drink & bite. We were seated right away and I was really surprised by how large the restaurant was. It has a cool Mexican vibe along with loud music playing(which didn't really bother me). They also have a huge open window across the side which would be cool to sit near on hot night. I was mainly looking forward to trying one of their margaritas, as I have seen they have a lot of neat flavors. I ordered the sangria blur margarita which sounded right up my alley. After checking my ID, the waitress said she needed to see my fiancé's ID who hasn't turned 21 yet, even though he was not ordering an alcoholic drink. She said we both needed to be 21 for me to order a drink because of \"sharing\". Now the waitress was nice enough about it and it was clear it was just the restaurant's policy, and I wasn't going to argue. But, this is absolutely ridiculous. I could see if I was getting a bottle of wine or a pitcher of beer maybe since those are typically shared, but I was just getting a margarita! If I was a server here I would be pissed about this policy because it's obviously going to lower their check , and therefore their tips. When I told my mom about this later she couldn't believe we even stayed, but it was already late and we were hungry. \n\nWe did not get a free salsa, unlike what other reviewers mentioned. But, we ordered a chips and salsa anyway. The chips were fine but they were mostly broken. The salsa didn't taste bad, but the texture of it was very weird. It was super thick, so much so that it was difficult to scoop onto your chip. I would have been unhappy with this even if the salsa were free! Again, this should have been a sign to get out here, lol. But, I ordered a chicken quesadilla. The chicken quesadilla wasn't bad, however it was no better than what you would get at somewhere like Chilli's. Also, what I didn't like was it came with peppers and onion which was fine, but there were more peppers and onions on there than chicken! Some of the dessert looked good, but at that point we were just ready to leave. The one good thing I will add about our experience was that our waitress was very friendly and attentive. Forget the mediocre food, the alcohol policy alone is enough to keep me from coming back here. It's actually kind of insulting. Now, we go out to eat A LOT , and I have never had this happen. So I'm not going to come back somewhere I cannot even get a drink. It's a shame because this place had the potential to be good and the location is convenient enough.",

I was very impressed with the customer service and they were so nice and polite, not to mention helpful because it was my first time there. \n\nThe Bubble Tea was the best I've ever had. It is mostly tea based rather than just a milk and powder, and they use tapioca pearls that are soft and delicious. It wasn't too thick with milkiness like I'm used to, and the thickness of the dairy always upsets my stomach. But not here! It's light and delicious \n\nOne thing I also noticed is that the place was very clean and organized and that made me even more happy to eat my delicious food. \n\nThis will be what I eat every time I come to this mall, without a doubt.\n\nP.s. I literally made a yelp account just to post a review",

They came out hot but the crab seasoning was overwhelming.  I ordered the lobster roll and had the same problem, way too much crab seasoning.  I had to blot my sandwich to try and get some of the seasoning off.  The rest of my family ordered cheesesteaks and said they were ok but felt that there wasn't a lot of meat on them.  We go to Chickie and Pete's fairly often but this time we felt the food was below par.",

We were sat by the window which overlooks the city with a gorgeous view. The wait staff was the perfect amount of attentive, refilling drinks and checking on us. The only reason I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars is because the sushi is good but nothing special. They have fun and unique rolls that are delicious but it isn't the best sushi I've ever had in my life. However, it's an affordable way to impress a date!",

YUM).  My roommates all love the FYA Burger (deep fried bacon and an egg) so much it's all any of them order.  As previously noted, most items can be made vegetarian or vegan, which is awesome.\n\nA few things set it apart from other places I've been besides the nummy food: there's all sorts of games there (not just board games- dominos is an option), the chillest bar cat, and a nifty looking small fireplace.  Only recently discovered that they play The Walking Dead on Sunday nights (why did I discover this near the end of the season?!?!).  They have a late night happy hour (10pm-midnight), where draft beers are $2 off.\n\nDespite being a fan of this place, there are times I don't go there: Tuesday nights (staff has an attitude) and if it's super cold outside (the bar's not very well heated).",

When I got home, I found that instead of the Shrimp Carbonara that I ordered and paid for, they gave me Chicken.  Not a huge deal, but I like shrimp and I had paid a little more for the Shrimp.  I called and talked to the manager.  I thought she might offer to replace the meal if I returned to the restaurant, which wasn't going to happen.  She apologized for the mistake and offered to send me a gift card.  I received the card 2 days later, which more than paid for my meal.  Great customer service.  The chicken, also, wasn't bad.",

Really ensure you have some when you try Luke. Also ate the redfish which was good, just a little wet from too much butter. Then we had the mussels which are always very good.

One of my gal pals recommended Get your Grub on and also gave me fair warning I would be going to a garage! \n\nThe owner Mr. Green welcomed me with a handshake, a personal touch I appreciated. I went with the crab leg platter which included corn, broccoli, potatoes, sausage, & shrimp. He made it fresh so allow about 20 minutes if you don't order ahead. He has a huge TV and satellite radio to entertain you while you wait.  \n\nWhen he brought out the final product I just had to stare at it fora bit. A. Work. Of. Art. Once I got past the beauty I dove in. Instead of the normal butter sauce you find on these meals he has a special grub sauce that has a spicy kick that I love. No oily mess, straight flavor!

All three were very delicious! My fave would probably be the Honey Chipotle Burger, which was topped with bacon, carmelized onions, BBQ pulled pork and an onion ring. Pretty much all the topping I look for in a tasty burger. White cheddar was a good choice of cheese and went nicely as a topping for this burger.\n\nWe split a basket of fries, which came with house made ketchup, ranch and chipotle sauce.\n\nFor dessert, we split the Peach White Chocolate Bread Pudding (OMG so gooood and very moist) and Whiskey Fudge Brownie (rich and went well with vanilla ice cream).\n\nThe server split our bill very evenly and provided excellent service!",

A pleasant surprise was how easy it was to cut the pizza slices with fork and knife. \n\nThe toppings were fresh, delectable and savory.

It takes a big man to know when he's past his college party days, so I can thankfully say I have never been here for the much advertised all you can drink specials (although it was called Drink and Drown back when I was a kid).  The only times I've ever been to this place are during the very mundane times I've had new tires put on or an oil change done at the spot down the street. \n\nWhile I have to admit service can at time be a bit on the slow side, I've never had to wait very large amounts of time, nor have I ever felt neglected when I'm at this place.  Whether I sit at the bar or at a high top, my glass stays relatively full and my order comes out very quickly.  Not sure if some of my fellow Yelpers have just caught the staff at a bad time, but I've had full on conversations with the bartender and even with one of the very nice servers.  She walked past me and told me she had the exact same shoes as I had on.  We then had a 20 minute chat about what shoes we preferred for what type of working out and how she gets hers at a steal because she can get them in boys' sizes.  \n\nAll in all, this seems to be a great little neighborhood bar and restaurant when it's not UT party time.  The food is solid, the beer menu has variety, and it's a 2 minute walk from the oil change spot when you have to be an adult.",

My salad with chicken was simple,  but the Smoking Goose brat looked great. The potato salad was very moist but flavorful if you like mayonnaise-based potato salad. The beverages are of course the attraction and a full assortment of their beers is available. We'll be back to sample more of the menu.",

There are no Saturday specials, even during games. Every other bar in the area has several. Annoyed when asked about specials or to see a menu. If you don't like crowds, I guess it's okay. I'd rather spend Saturday games at Mac's, Sto's, or Fox & Hound.",

  "text": "I got a giftcard to this restaurant for christmas and as my mother and I had both heard good things i'd thought we'd give it a shot. I knew the restaurant gets packed on friday and saturday nights so we went on a sunday night. There was a healthy amount of people and so there was some wait time, a little more than i think there should have been honestly.\n\nThe menu is pretty decent, all the standard tex-mex fair, burritos, enchiladas, quesadillas etc , mostly meat based but there are plenty of options for vegetarians as well. The decor is warm but super hipster and trendy. I appreciated it. \n\nSadly, all the food we had was lackluster. I had a chicken torta which was alright except for the very blackened chicken which I never really enjoyed. My mother got a steak enchilada/burrito concoction which she didn't enjoy too much and from what  i saw appeared to be more peppers/onions than anything else.\n\nHonestly I won't be going back here. It's just not worth it.",

This place has stood up to the test or time as we've gone year after year and it's still consistent and just plain amazing. For a group that can never agree on anything for lunch, everyone always agrees upon this. I know that's subjective, but really...how often does that happen?\n\nTry their meat lovers..all fresh ingredients and perfectly cooked. Nice thin/crispy crust and burn-the-top-of-your-mouth cheese...mmmmm\n\nI cannot review any other of their products, I've only had their pizza.\n\nOther points of note:\nThey carry both coke and pepsi products.\nTons of lunch specials\nIf you're by yourself, they have a old-school type bar you can pull up to\nOrder by the slice",

Never the less, I just stayed here for 3 nights and thought the place was pretty nice, grounds were clean and well maintained and the hotel was modern and nice.  It'spretty much set into the side of a mountain which is pretty cool, has a long driveway up to the front office from the highway which is nice (it's set off the HWY enough that your not listening to traffic).\n\nI thought the price was good, think I paid something in the vicinity of 95 bucks/night...certainly not complaining.  Staff was friendly, the bartender could sling drinks.\n\nMy complaints though (every yin has its yang)...\n1.  I was stuck in a back building and the parking sucked...plenty of open spaces, but poor lighting and a little bit of a haul to carry your stuff into my particular door there.\n2.  Being on the backside, its surrounded by condos or whatever...and some of the locals decided to entertain EVERYONE with some Rap & R&B...not thrilled by that at all.\n3.  I lugged a ton of stuff to my hotel room door and my key card wouldn't work (I'm by myself), my cell didn't have a signal...and I had to haul all of my crap back out to my car so I could drive around to the front office to get a new card.  Maybe this was a fluke (probably)...but it enraged me since I had three or four 75lb bags!\n\nGood bar/restaurant up the street within a mile or so and I didn't see many cops on the HWY at all.\n\nI'd stay here again, but I would be cognizant of where the room is located next time.",

  "text": "Chariot's might be your perfect pie place, if you like it greasy and cheesy; if not, then reconsider.\n\nOrdered a large pizza with kalamatas, a Greek salad and breadsticks.\n\nPizza was greasy and the dough was rubbery and soggy. It was the same dough they used in the breadsticks which was fried dough topped with powdered parm, also chewy, not garlicky and not good.  The generous Greek salad was okay, but primarily relied on iceberg lettuce.\n\nI like the fact that they offer a couple of Greek options and tons of sandwiches; maybe that's the way to go. My stomach still hurts from the other option.\n\nOrder and delivery was pleasant.",

  "text": "Back a few months ago, I'd probably give this place 5 stars. U Got Munchies has always been my favorite take-out place near Temple - everything was great. My absolute favorite was the Continental Burger (a bacon cheeseburger with french toast as buns, an egg, and maple syrup), the bar fries (ground beef, jalapeno, and sour cream) and several others. I ordered from here all the time.\n\nWhen I heard they were closed for some renovations this summer, I was anticipating their return. I've ordered from them twice now since they reopened, and it just isn't the same. They got rid of my aforementioned favorites, but everything now just seems...cheaper. I just ordered their \"red eye burger\" (the continental, minus the french toast) and the bun just seems very generic. I ordered a different burger a few weeks ago and it seemed cheaper and smaller also. One upside is their new option for a vegetarian black bean burger instead of a regular beef patty - I love black bean burgers so this earns a plus from me.\n\nAs for their service, they're always super quick with delivery and I love their conveniently late hours.\n\nBottom line: still good, but not as amazing as before.",

  "text": "Important: This review is only for Brennan's banana fosters dessert. The dessert ($10) was only average if not underwhelming. We had heard from a number of locals that there are only two places in nola to get a legitimate banana fosters, made table side; the first being Commander's palace and the second being Brannan's. For some reason my party had missed the dessert at Commander's so I knew it was imperative to try Brennan's. In terms of flavor, it tasted too simple, like vanilla ice cream with a banana and some butter-- so something that you can easily make at home. It was really missing the vibrance of the caramelization and the fragrance from the alcohol. Our waitress, being inexperienced, was talked through some key details and then left to her own devices. The end result was that she probably needed more practice in the back to get the technique down before making the hallmark dish for customers.",

  "text": "You can take two approaches to this place: You can do the fancy sit down dinner, hopefully with someone else who has a decent income and can pick up the check, or you can do the fun and relaxed happy hour. I have done both, and my vote hands down is happy hour.\n\nDon't get me wrong, going there for dinner was amazing. All the food tasted really fresh and authentic. However, it is definitely one of the more pricey mexican restaurants in the city. Happy hour, on the other hand, was quite the deal. I got there at 6, and we were immediately greeted by the bartender with chips and two kinds of salsa. Two of us got margaritas (try the pomegranate) and one got their house tequila straight up. The margaritas were good, not too sweet, and only $5. We then ordered queso fundido ($6) and guacamole ($4). Both of which were amazing, even though it's hard to go wrong with melted cheese. They even gave me a free tequila popper at the end since it was my birthday!\n\nSo, the bottom line is that happy hour offers quality food and drinks for great prices in an awesome atmosphere. The inside of the restaurant is very ornately decorated but it gorgeous. The service was great, and the bartender and servers were nice. So nice in fact, that it was almost creepy. Almost.",

Service is good (don't like servers that are too attentive) plus free sodas when you order ramen. The price though didn't match the ramen $10.00 to $11.00 for a bowl of ramen that lacks flavor.

The waffles are \"bacon waffles\" which sounded exciting but there is not really enough bacon in them to make a difference.  They are served with that thick white biscuit gravy.  The coffee was good but the food took a long time to come out.  Total bill was $16.90.  I have nothing else to say about it.  It gets a solid \"eh, okay\".  I would eat here again, if I were nearby and nothing else was clearly available, but I would not go out of my way.\n\nGoogle was deeply confused about where the restaurant is.  It wants you to go east from Monument Circle and then turn up Scioco Street, which is a useless little service alley.  This is all wrong.

  "text": "4.5\n\nWhaaat? I'm late. I'm so very very late. It seems that most everyone who knows food in Middle Tennessee was already hip to the deliciousness of Soy Bistro. Mea culpa. To my credit, it's not entirely my fault that I am eight or so years late dining here. I don't get to Brentwood that often and I confused this establishment with another of a similar name and menu. But, still. My mistake. If you haven't picked up what I'm putting down is that you should probably get to Soy Bistro sooner rather than later.\n\nI was a bit intimated coming here, as tales of a small parking lot and long lines stressed me out a bit. I was pleased to discover that arriving at 1 pm on a Friday afforded me a spot in front and a line that moved very quickly. The food gods were shining on me. When my lunch partner and I arrived at the counter, we were greeted with a smile and pleasant conversation. Stahp it, Soy Bistro. We're already going steady. I prepared myself for another potential bomb: I needed something that was gluten-free. Before my gut betrayed me, I was a Korean food-eating machine. But I know that a lot of meats and sauces are made with soy sauce so... I barely had the question out of my mouth before the gentleman behind the counter told me I had nothing to worry about: there were plenty of gluten-free items from which to choose and most everything could be made gluten-free.\n\nGirls, hit your hallelujah.\n\nThere was no stopping me now. I ordered the kimchi fried rice and kept it moving. My lunch partner and I nabbed a table and started business talking. Within a very reasonable amount of time, I had a mound of beautifully red fried rice, packed with kimchi and spam and topped with a fried egg. Better yet, when the food came out, the owner grabbed utensils and napkins for us because we were just *that* out of it to miss it on our first pass. Oh, did I mention the spicy sauce that came on the side? I should. It added a surprising kick (I am usually not one for creamy sauces with Asian cuisine) and it was gluten-free. I broke the yolk, mixed it and and the sauce in the rice, took out my chopsticks (It had been way too long since I was able to eat with chopsticks) and went to town.\n\nSo so good. The kimchi was wonderfully pickled and spicy and the salty fat of the spam balanced well with the creaminess of the aforementioned sauces. The rice was a star of the plate, not a place holder. The chef (I met) knows what she's doing. We were checked on a few times during the meal and enjoyed some pleasant small talk. Eying the specials and house favorites, I made several notes to self of dishes to try upon return visits -- because there will be return visits.\n\nDon't wait as long as I did; get yourself to Soy Bistro as soon as you can. The people behind the brand are really *really* nice and the food is as good as advertised... maybe even better. For all your transplants bemoaning the 'lack' of certain cuisines in Nashville... come get your fill in Brentwood. I know you have a car.",

We went in with open minds to not compare to Sabor.... cute place on the inside and our waiter was very nice. We both got house margaritas that we're good and the queso that was pretty good too. But that was it. We were indecisive on what to get so we decided to try the combo. And wow was it a lot of food but it was nothing that we expected.\n\nIt was all very bland the burrito literally had just ground beef in it that's it. So did the enchilada all it did was have a lot of sauce added on top it was supposed to come with a chile raleno but it was just a little slice of green pepper covered in cheese I wish I had a better picture but you couldn't see what it is anyways under all the cheese. It came with the what they so-called a Chalupa but it was just a soggy flat tortilla with a ton of guac and cheese on it. And a hardshell taco on top of it so you couldn't even tell that underneath it was supposed to be a Chalupa. The rice and beans were decent we ended up eating that and our chips n queso that was it.. not gonna lie we were excited to try this place but boy were we very disappointed. It felt like it was very sloppy and thrown together. Maybe we should've stuck with what we originally wanted which was a quesadilla and the fajitas. \n\n\nI don't think we will be returning but I hope the kitchen makes some improvements because it was the most bland Mexican food I've ever had. \n\n\n\nOn the other hand we're going to go get sushi right now since we barely ate anything.",

The restaurant with wooden clean interior is housed in a warm comfortable place, and the menu of meat options as well as sides here was impressive. \n\nThe food options are typical of a Tennessee bar bq restaurant, except that Edley's perhaps has the best Texas beef brisket in town, and it makes choosing between the brisket and the excellent pork sandwich pretty difficult. I chose the green beans and tasty mac n cheese for my sides, but I'll have to say that the Brunswick stew looked very enticing. The jalapeño cornbread was a bit dry, but I loved that they grilled the cornbread before serving it on the plate. \n\nI had few expectations of Edley's, but I think it now moves to my top 3 Nashville bar-b-que joints, and it's a nice place to enjoy it too.",

  "text": "First LOVE the concept of BFF Café, the concept is long overdue, and SORELY needed! \n\nI tried BFF a while back on a Monday and found out there only do Fuel Packs, which is take and heat at home and or you can heat up there. That didn't interest me, so I said I would be back. \n\nI arrived today, and was excited to eat here, as I tried a small sample at a Yelp Elite Event (YEE). I ordered at the counter with a younger gentlemen and it wasn't busy to me, 1 guy waiting and 2 people already eating, and 1 couple behind me. \n\nI asked what to order as I was REALLY HUNGRY, and the gentlemen right off the bat said the Bison Burger ($16) without skipping a beat. I rarely eat bison and I was craving what I had at the YEE, and next he said Paleo Hunter Zoodle, either one was super filling. \n\nTotal for food was $3 for Cauliflower Fingers, $12 for the Paleo Hunter Zoodle. A full check plus small tip was just over $17, that's w/out a drink! I consider this a high price point for a lunch. \n\nI thoroughly checked over restaurant, something feels missing here, not sure, what best describes. My best interpretation is it's feel like an empty cafeteria, order here, fill your drink here, get condiments over there, and bus your table, basically no service, order, and just wait. I had a number on my table and the food comes out, a bit slow considering there was 1 order in front of me, and I think the dish I ordered much of it was pre-made like braised beef, vegetable noodles, etc. \n\nMy dish arrives and it looks naked, I only ate a sample at the YEE, so I didn't know why it felt naked, but I felt like there should be a sauce over it or on the side, as it looks very much NAKED, I was quite confused because my cauliflower (C) fingers had a salsa side. I tried the C fingers first, as it's my guess is it's the C pizza, cut into strips, to make the fingers. I had enough salsa for about half of them, and it was okay, kind of cool to be able to order a unique side, but wouldn't need to order it again, as the flavor was okay to below okay, not enough C for me (also no notations on nutrition on this dish nor other hand-helds???) \n\nI am looking at my main dish the Paleo Hunter, and again, it feels so naked, I start thinking about what sauces I can add to it, but nothing looks like a match, but I did notice a wasabi in the cooler when waiting to order, and thought if it's real wasabi that might give it a bit of flavor and heat, and at least add much much needed moisture to this dish that looks like it needed something to blanket. Please note, I did ask cashier, who said it was okay to grab the wasabi dixie cup from the cooler.  \n\nI added the sauce very carefully and then being a professional salad tosser (Western Village Steakhouse) from 1994, I tossed my dish expertly and thoroughly in case the wasabi was super hot, which I was HOPING it was! It was NOT! I started eating the dish, and the first I notice it was below lukewarm in temperature, it was just between cold and luke warm, I was quite confused. \n\nI spent only about 2-3 minutes eating the C fingers, so that couldn't be it, the wasabi from the cooler was about 1.5 oz Dixie cup, carefully poured to cover the dish, why was my dish almost cold, maybe that's how they do it here, it's a unique place, serving unique, maybe they don't want the nutrients to cook off??? I wasn't sure, but then again, I really didn't want to just eat it and assume, so I waited to talk to the cashier, who really just takes orders and gets food from the back, but all of the sudden it took over 5 minutes and a phone order, to get his attention. \n\nI said, should my food be almost cold? He said yeah maybe, because it didn't sit under the heat lamp that long. I was still puzzled so I said, how was it cooked? He said on the stove. I was was still puzzled, his answer was that yeah, if it goes from the stove to the plate to your table that happens. Okay, I decided to eat the food as it was, and as I did I realized, I was never eat here again, so it's really simple, just eat, leave, and a solid review, to let my fans know the biz (I want to save you $$, if you value it)! \n\nAgain love the concept of BFF, but based on today experience THIS PLACE IS NOT FOR ME! Last but not least, as I was relaying the story to co-workers, because you know the power of a bad experience, you usually share 10x and a good experience 1x, I remembered, looking at the menu, and then I remembered being at my YEE event, that this dish is suppose to have a Blanket, which today was Missing, and that is the Chimichurri Sauce! That was another aha moment of the terrible experience I had today. \n\nLast note the cashier told me that they had a big rush before me that's why the food didn't sit under the heat lamp long enough to warm up the food, I guess that big to go order before me really stressed the chef! The guy sitting down that I saw leave with a bag of food probably for a family of 2-3 adults and 2-3 kid, that's PRESSURE!",

  "text": "Tucked in the Drury Plaza ( my hotel of choice) by the arch, Carmine's is a part of the Lombardo's family of restaurants.  I will start by saying that the food was really good, but by itself more like a four. What shot this up to a five was the service. Our server had the perfect balance of quality service, knowledge of food preparation, and out of the way when not needed. At the same time, he made it feel like we were VIP's seated in his private dining room.\nHad the toasted ravioli for appetizer, again very good. Entree was a petite filet mignonette served with their bacon mashed potatoes. Good portion size. My dinner party had some of the seafood options.  Would definitely go back.",

I had a combination of rolls and nigiri and I was underwhelmed by both.  The fish wasn't super fresh and the rolls were very heavy on the rice.  The staff was very nice but there are places in Indy who serve way better sushi that focus more on the fish.  If you are a real sushi lover...you probably won't love this place",

  "text": "My chicken gyro was alright. Going in, I knew I had to keep my expectations low, because they have a huge menu of varied foods and types of cuisine, and that's never a good sign. It's like that saying: jack of all trades, master of none. They have tacos, and gyros, and cheesesteaks, and burgers, and and and ... \n\nSo my chicken gyro was alright. It satisfied my appetite. My husband got the Philly cheesesteak, and he said it was OK. We also got a cheeseburger and fries for the kids, and they really liked it. Overall, our meal was just fine, and I especially liked that I paid less than $20 for all that food. The cheeseburger and fries combo even came with our choice of lemonade. We chose original.\n\nOh, that's another thing. You can choose different flavors of lemonade, but they really just have a base lemonade flavor (lemon), and then they will add squirts of high-fructose-corn-syrup-food-coloring water in your choice of artificial flavor. It's the kind of stuff that's squirted on snow cones. Whomp whomp. If you're going to have the word \"lemonade\" as a part of your business name, and you're going to offer different flavors of lemonade, shouldn't you make actual different types of lemonade? Anyone agree with me? No one? Maybe I'm just being grouchy. \n\nWhile I was waiting for my food (they cook it it up fresh to order, by the way, which is nice), I got to enjoy a Puff Daddy/Mase music video on the TV, which was amazing and almost made me bump this review up to four stars. A restaurant that can transport me to 1997 can't be half bad.",

  "text": "I'd say it's a 4.5.  Can we talk about how colorful the dishes are?? More importantly, can we talk about how delicious the food was? \n\nSo, I had the:\nSalaw Machu Kreung (lemongrass soup with slices of beef lungs)\nPleah Sach Ko (Raw beed salad)\nPrah Hok Kateeh (ground beef marinated with fermented fish served with vegetables)\nMussels with coconut sauce\nMussels with curry sauce\nFrog meat with vegetables (Forgot the name)\nKah-Puh Chin (Fried shrimp with some sort of mayo/sriracha sauce)\nCooked (Grilled?) beef with fermented fish sauce\nSome sort of chicken dish I totally forgot\n\nOut of these dishes, my favorites are: Kah-Puh Chin, Prah Hok Kateeh, and the grilled beed with fermented fish sauce, and the raw beef salad.\n\nMy least favorite was the mussels with the curry sauce, which was surprising because I totally thought I'd like it based off how delicious it looks from other people's pictures.\n\nIt was my first time eating frog as well.  It wasn't too bad; it was like chewy chicken meat.  It was also my first time eating raw beef. Again, I was surprised I liked it.\n\nNow make no mistake, Cambodian food is completely different from other Asian dishes.  I don't know how to describe it, but it's a more \"ethnic/heavy\" tasting.  The dishes use a lot of lemongrass.  Khmer Kitchen is authentic Cambodian food, but it's slightly on the sweeter side, according to one friend who just came from Cambodia. The food is still delicious, though!  If you're new to Cambodian food, I'd recommend the Prak Hok Kateh or Kah-Puh Chin.\n\nThe service is great; they are very accommodating and casual.  The restaurant itself was very small.  I believe there were only 8-10 tables that can seat a group of 4.  This restaurant is very popular.  I suggest asking for a reservation.  My group of 8 got lucky and got seated right away.  \n\nWord of advice, the kitchen closes at 8 pm so come before 8 pm.  Also, cash only!!",

The eggplant parmesan did not come as ordered.  The put cheese on it even though I requested that they not.  I called back to the store to let them know.  After checking to see how the order was placed and that in fact I was correct the guy on the phone kept talking about giving me a discount and never asked if I wanted it remade and to get another one.  After advising him that I needed it made correctly he agreed to make another one I could come get it.\n\nWhen I got to the store he gave me the correct sub.  No apologies for making it incorrect.  I then asked about the discount that he kept insisting that I take vs making me the sub the correct way.  He stated that I would not get a discount on a future order even though my wife did not eat with the rest of the family because they messed up her sub the first attempt.  The reason that was given was because they remade the sub.  I was amused.  I advised him that he remade the sub that they didn't make right the first time, he didn't do me any favors in fact it took more time for me to get the sub the second time and my wife didn't eat with the family.  It was more of a hassle that was created for us than anything.\n\nThis was the first time that I have ordered from here.  I thought I would give the local store a chance since they are close to the house and I can get there in less than 3 minutes and the menu looked like it had a lot to offer.\n\nI only give two stars because the pizza was actually good.  I am not sure I will be back.  They could have given me as little as a 10% discount for my inconvenience and I would have been happy.  But to tell me that there would be none after they insisted that was the route they wanted to go before I told them I needed a new sub and they never apologized for making it incorrectly in the first place.",

  "text": "I had heard good things about Penang in Chinatown, so I finally caved and decided to try it out with some friends. We had seen huge queues out the door during prime times on the weekends, so we opted to try it on a weeknight. Walking in, it looked pretty upscale for a restaurant in Chinatown. The ambiance definitely resembled something of a romantic date scene. \n\nWe opted to try the pad Thai, green curry seafood in a clay pot, and basil chicken. The food was a little slow to arrive but not a huge deal. The green curry seafood was pretty delicious, with a good amount of spice. My personal preference, but I would have preferred it to be a little thicker, as it was definitely a broth consistency. The pad Thai was also flavored well, with shrimp and bean sprouts scattered throughout the dish. I was not a fan of how chopped up the noodles were for it. They were so small, you couldn't really eat it with chopsticks. The basil chicken was a very solid choice though. Spiced well, the chicken wasn't dry, and it was an overall well made dish with presentation.",

I was third in line and planned to secure a table for a group of seven when the Ale opened (11:00). A few minutes after 11:00, the door to the front bar opened first. After about 30  seconds, the door to the back door still wasn't opened.  The people behind me (last in line) turned and entered through the front bar entrance. By the time the back bar entrance opened, the tables were all take by those who ran in the front entrance and through the front bar to grab back bar tables.  I've been a patron here for 12 years and seen some of the best college basketballs games of my life in the Ale.  Their food is fantastic and the bee selection is too notch (they had Zombie Dust on tap), but this experience was a slap in the face.  This entire process needs to be supervised by the manager/owner.  Completely wasted over an hour of my morning freezing my butt off to get robbed.  We ended up pushing tables together in the front bar, but it wasn't the same quality viewing experience as we should have had. I'll spend my $130 in another sports bar next year.

No, it's not the best, but it is the most convenient for me. \n\nI've also noticed over the past few weeks that some of the buffet items are now getting cycled around; it used to be the exact same things every day.\n\nI just recently noticed on Monday that they now have shrimp and mussels in the buffet....they looked ok, but I have a strict rule on seafood at buffet's so wouldn't be able to tell you if it's any good or not.\n\nThe waitstaff is consistent and has been the same for years. It's nice to see the same faces, but in the end, they're just keeping my drinks filled (which they do quite well and better than most well-established restaurants).\n\nSo yea, this review is a culmination of years of attendance through the ups and downs, but now they are on an up-swing and my co-workers and I go about once a week.\n\nNotable item: the buffalo wings (I know, I know) but these are outstanding for some reason.",

I went to the restaurant on a Sunday (today) during the day, and could not believe my ears as I was skimming through the dirty and sticky menu. The bartender I had to deal with was awful. It was a female with long blond hair. I believe her name is Kyla or similar. She called me cheap because I didn't tip, and even had the nerve to ask me if something was wrong with her service,  however the service was terrible and I don't think I've ever been to bar where the bartender seemed to be more preoccupied with gossiping than helping a guest.  The food was good but I didn't get to try it right away being that I had to wait for silverware. As I was eating, my cup was becoming empty and no water was offered or another drink. I stood up and went to the other bar across the dining room to get water and eventually I moved over there where I actually got good service and didn't feel as though I was sitting in the audience of jerry springer episode. I also don't appreciate the kyla/bartender referring to me as the \"cheap Hispanic guy\" to her Co-workers and her Co-worker which also looked Hispanic didn't seem very enthused either. I would NOT and will not ever return in the future especially with the same bartenders working there that I had to deal with, very and extremely disappointed",

Only negative for me was the music was a bit too loud, they were just playing a local Top 40 station; there was a lot of Kesha for some reason.\n\nFood 4/5\nWhen we put in our order the waitress asked if we wanted soup or salad so we both thought these were included with the meal; the salad and soup were only $2 each so I'm really not complaining but it was just a surprise when we got the bill and learned it wasn't included. Just something to note. In any case both were very good. The salad dressing was really delicious, it had a hint of peanut, not your everyday ginger salad dressing that I've had at other places. We then got an order of the Gyoza. They were crispy and flavorful without being greasy. For sushi I ordered the Spicy Scallop and the Celebration Roll (one of the daily specials) both were delicious, the Celebration Roll was a party in my mouth! Husband got the Birthday Roll and the Fujiama Roll, he liked the Birthday Roll better. They also had a beer special going on, husband's Kirin Ichiban was only $2. I also received a $5 off coupon for checking in on Yelp.\n\nOver all a good experience, we will definitely be back as they have a wide variety of interesting rolls we'd like to try!",

  "text": "I'd been contemplating trying Rockstone Pizzeria & Pub since my visit to the nearby Wiseguys Pizza, but it was a recent visit by a friend that made me finally say \"Okay, it's time.\" So, on a lazy Sunday afternoon I decided it would be a great place to enjoy a meal, watch the Colts game, and read my Sunday newspaper. \n\nRockstone is located in a strip center just inside Fishers, Indiana with a Sahm's location and a Massage Indy location also located in the strip. It's not a particularly impressive building, but it's infinitely less divey than the nearby Wiseguys. \n\nI will admit that Rockstone lost a star before I ever made it inside. While they have a nice little curb cut that helps with wheelchair access, they'd rather ignorantly placed their outdoor signage on the sidewalk very close to an outdoor bike rack and it blocked anyone with a mobility issue from actually accessing the restaurant. While I was able to move it, it wasn't exactly simple to do so and a lot of folks with mobility issues wouldn't be able to do so. \n\nOnce I got by the sign, I went in their double-glass doors and there was a host/hostess area with a hand-written sign to seat ourselves at the bar. That was simple enough and, in fairness, I did arrive at almost 2pm in the afternoon. So, I seated myself at a four-seat table that was for the most part out of the light from the outside. The walls had several televisions, all playing football games and all playing the Colts game with the exception of one. There were also a few booths along the outside of the dining area against the walls. The place was almost empty with the exception of a couple booths that were taken and a handful of bodies at the bar. \n\nI don't really consider myself high maintenance, but I do have this guideline that if you're an employee and you see me enter and sit down then you should acknowledge me whether you're going to be my server or not. So, I was a little disconcerted to have one server completely ignore me as she walked by me twice. Finally, a server came by and noticed my presence and handed me a drink menu before noticing I hadn't been given any other menus. I'm not sure why I needed a lunch menu when lunch specials are only applicable Monday-Friday, but I received one. \n\nThe decor has sort of a pub meets industrial vibe to it. The drink menu is extensive, though I stuck with my usual iced tea. The menu consists primarily of wood-baked pizzas, appetizers, a couple desserts, and a few foccaccia sandwiches. While the idea of a whole pizza wasn't really appealing, I opted for a 10\" pepperoni as I'd been told their wood-stove pizzas were good. \n\nThe wait wasn't bad at all and within a few minutes I had my pizza. It was light, crispy, and to be perfectly honest I had no problem polishing it all off without feeling overly stuffed. Of course, I hadn't eaten at all during the day and that likely helped. The toppings were good and plentiful and balanced throughout each slice. \n\nService was attentive and I did get my always desired refill. \n\nWhat's my overall impression? As I noted, I swiped away one star right away because of the unnecessary and inconsiderate accessibility issue. Thus, we're in the 3-4 star range here. There's a part of me that wants to give Rockstone a 4-star rating, but I have to be honest and say it lacked that certain spark that separates it from other establishments. While there's no question that the atmosphere is vastly superior to Wise Guys, I honestly preferred the Wise Guys pizza. This pizza, while I liked the wood-baked quality, was good but it simply didn't \"wow\" me like I want an upper tier pizzeria to wow me. The same was true for the service - it was attentive but not particularly inviting. In my opinion, really good service makes you want to go back and go back soon. I enjoyed my meal, but Rockstone will definitely not be a destination spot for me. If I really want a wood-baked pizza, Napolese is closer and superior.",

I ordered a linked in pizza with bell pepper,grilled onion and olives.I got olives and jalepenos.I was not aware who even was preparing my pizza and when I mentioned that was not what I ordered they told me it was too late too late.The restaurant changed the toppings on this pizza but the menu did not reflect the change. They barely cooked my pizza in the oven. Rhe pizza was soggy, the jalepenos were not fresh,and caused the pizza to taste like vinegar. I was very dissatisfied and disappointed in my service because when I complained no one seemed to care.It seems that there was no one in charge so they can get away with rude behavior and poor service. I would rather spend more money at a restaurant that prepared a better pizza the way I ordered it. So sad because I love wood fired pizza.",

I had a short rib korean taco (great), Carnitas taco/spicy rice/beans (all just okay). Beans were in a super small cup used usually for a small cole slaw which was disappointing. A friend recommended this place due to having been to the one in Vegas. Atmosphere is really nice and dining seats almost 700 people. Full menu is extremely large so I'm willing to give it another shot. It is a bit on the expensive side ($13 for 2 tacos and small sides). With a beer, a couple could easily be spending over $50 for lunch if you dont pick from their lunch menu (which is $10, no drink). Might not be bad compared to other markets but is expensive in Indy considering the amount of options available.",

And, Transcend wins by a landslide. It doesn't even matter which location you go to, the Ritchie Market or the Garneau location. That's what's so incredible about it. It doesn't matter who makes my lattes, it tastes the same each time. Consistence is key! They don't ever make their lattes too hot. It's perfect temperature so you can drink straight away. I always get it with almond milk, and it'd literally heaven when I take my first sip. \nI can even get it to go, or to stay, again, it's always consistently great.\n\nI don't get pastries here too much. It would be wonderful if they started getting scones in. But, they have more croissants and muffins. I like their spinach and feta, or the chocolate croissant. However, they don't warm up the pastry at all. So, that's the only down side if you're looking to eat something warm. I'm giving it 5 stars solely on the lattes I've tried and just the overall ambiance of this cafe.",

The owners? \nWhichever it is, we will never come back after tonight's terrible service. It took 45 minutes just to get my water (after politely reminding the server 3 times) until I finally walked up to the serving station and began to pour it myself before our server offered to take over. Food was mediocre and overpriced, took about 40 minutes to come out. All I could do by the end was just laugh about it, not worth making a scene. I wish we could get a decent restaurant in Spanish Springs, Bully's certainly isn't one.",

  "text": "Solid tacos near Center City. They're not \"so good I'd make an effort to go out of my way to go there\" kind of tacos but you can go here and come away happy. I'll definitely stop by again if I happen to be in the area.\n\nThe Al Pastor meat is on a spit which means THIS is what you should be ordering. It's juicy and succulent though it could have a bit more flavor than it has. The tacos come on tortillas out of a plastic package, so I assume aren't made in house, but have a good flavor and aren't at all dry.\n\n$9 for three tacos is a bit pricey, but hey tacos in Philly ain't cheap, and they force you to choose only one protein for all three tacos which is kind of annoying.\n\nThe green and red salsas are both great, each provide a different flavor and a small bit of spice.",

I was extremely impressed with their friendly and creative atmosphere. They mention being a young establishment (open for only about 3-4 years), but it seems they've done a lot to make this place a wonderful little cozy coffee shop. The location is in a fantastic laid-back part of town. With an outside patio to enjoy the coffee and pastries, Buttermilk Provision is certainly a must-stop location while relaxing in Tam",

Are you guys really that coffeegnorant? The food is nice and the selection and quality of their teas is amazing. \n\nWiFi: good luck with that one. The WiFi is free but also slow as hell, that's what happens when there are 75 individual IP's that use the same router. Do something about it! \n\nStaff: The staff is actually very helpful and knowledgeable; if you can find them or feel like going down to the first floor to the help desk. \n\n\nAll said, it's still my favorite place to burn time and educate myself on new material.",

  "text": "Disappointing experience all around. A couple friends and I bought a Groupon and decided to check this place out. We called in advance as instructed to let them know we were using a groupon and made the reservation. We had high expectations based on reviews and have been to quite a few farm-to-table spots that were awesome. The ambiance is cool - it's in an old train station. The menus were tiny, about 6 \"small plates\" and 6 \"large plates\" listed, BYOB, no list of non-alcoholic drinks or desserts. No bread on the table or anything like that, which is a shame with all of the amazing local bakeries. The waiter tells us about a prix fixe special - $25 for a small and large plate as well as dessert. Small selection for this but two of us ordered it anyway since it seemed to be a good deal. I ordered the 16oz strip steak medium rare for $35, plus a cheese plate for $10. Cheese plate came out first, it was underwhelming to say the least - two types of cheese, one small piece of soft cheese and a couple shavings of another kind, plus toasted pecans and some blueberries (complete with stems). No explanation as to what the cheese was, which local creamery it came from, nothing. It was OK, not great but not terrible. Then comes the steak - completely well done and grey in the middle. Not a hint of pink. I typically don't send things back if they are slightly off on temperature, but this was just awful. For $35, I expected it to at least be cooked correctly. I called the waiter and he was completely unapologetic. I asked for the sirloin instead since it was $10 cheaper and would rather take my chances on a cheaper plate the second time around in case I had the same issue. The waiter made it seem like I was inconveniencing him and again, no apology whatsoever. The sirloin came out and was good but the service still left a bad taste in my mouth. I ate alone as every one else at the table was finished. After dinner, we ordered desserts which were again just absolutely underwhelming. It comes time to pay and the waiter drops off the check, explaining as if he were doing me a favor that he didn't charge me for the overdone strip and for the sirloin instead. Gee, thanks pal. We inform our waiter of the groupon. It's then that he tells us he can't honor both the groupon and the prix fixe menu prices. It didn't say this anywhere on the groupon, we called to make the reservation and was never told that this was the case. After some exhausting back and forth, we gave in and had him remove the prix fixe prices so we could use the $80 Groupon. That added an additional $20+ to our check for a total of $125. At that point we just wanted to get out of there so we paid and left, all completely underwhelmed by the food and the service. If you want farm fresh food done correctly and for a great price, I highly recommend Genevieve's Kitchen in Doylestown. We will not be returning back to the local and will definitely not be recommending it to others.",

  "text": "I'm very excited about future patio afternoons at Chago's Cantina.  While my first visit was lacking in some areas, I still very much enjoyed our food and drinks.\n\nThings that were great:  We shared the fajitas w/ shrimp, steak, chicken and pork.  These were excellent!  We also shared the dip sampler that included some tasty guacamole, queso and pico de gallo (it also included some Mexican hummus that is in the not-so-great category).  I had a regular margarita, which was also great, though a little syrupy.\n\nNot-so-great:  The aforementioned hummus just didn't work.  We tried mixing it with some of the pico, but no...  Also, we were pretty set on just sharing one order of fajitas as we had no way of easily transporting leftovers (we were in the middle of a long walk).  At any rate, the server tried to talk us into a second order of fajitas.  He told us it was a pretty small serving.  We resisted getting a second order, figuring we could just order something else if it didn't fill us up.  Okay, so all of that and the one order of fajitas was massive.  We didn't come close to finishing.  Another annoyance, is for the massive sizzling skillet of goodness, we were given three tiny tortillas.  No way you could have fit the meat and veg in three tortillas.  Of course additional cost, but it was necessary.  Another annoyance was the teensy ramekins holding the dips for the sampler.  A little weak for the price tag.  \n\nSo a few negatives, but the place is new and this certainly won't steer me away.",

I've only eaten inside the restaurant once because I really go there to sit out on their \"patio.\"  The restaurant is in a little strip mall -- a nicer strip mall, true, but still a strip mall -- so the outdoor seating is in front of the restaurant along the sidewalk.  You're really only treated to a view of cars and people going to and from their cars, but to be able to dine al fresco and enjoy a bottle of wine is pretty great no matter what.  I also find that the service outside is as good as the service inside -- you don't end up waiting longer or feel forgotten about when you're outside -- it's adequately staffed and promptly attended to.",

The Fuji Chicken Salad I ordered had no chicken in it. I got my salad home, opened it up with ravenous anticipation, only to realize that there was no chicken. To make matters worse, there were about 60 pieces of red onion in the salad. \"Would you like some lettuce with your onions?\" I enjoy onions, but I'd rather not endure an afternoon of heartburn from eating dozens of pieces of them. Worse yet, it was my damn birthday. Talk about disappointment! \n\nAnd why was the baguette as hard as a rock at 12:00 PM? \n\nPanera Bread in general has always been a place of consistency for me. Fresh salads, hot soups, and you can rest-assured knowing that your order is correct. Nowadays, the only consistent aspect of Panera is that something will go awry with even the simplest order. It's a statewide epidemic!\n\nIf Panera didn't offer caffeine free fountain Diet Pepsi, then I would write them off for good. Once that goes awry, then I am \"out\"!",

I am guessing there is a lot of turnover, because the staff always seems to be different when we go in.\n\nThe last few times that we had poor service, and I appreciate that the owners/managers reached out to me.  I am not the type of person who will go into a venue and ask for a manager just so that I can get something for free.  I also don't want special treatment.  I like to go in and see how the staff treats every customer.  \n\nLast night we left and my BF said it was the last time we will go there.  It was the third time in a row that the service was just not good.  The evening started well.  We sat at the bar.  The restaurant was relatively slow for a Saturday night.  We were greeted and given our drinks right away.  But once again, it was hard to get another drink ordered.  We sat there with empty glasses while three staff played a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.  We could not get anyone's attention.  Then a large group of people came in.  Two of the staff disappeared and left one guy at the bar serving all of these people.  Made no sense.  And so we continued to sit there with empty glasses.  That is when we decided to leave.  But we could not flag anyone down to get our check.\n\nI get it when you are busy.  But look up, acknowledge that your customers are waiting and just say \"I will be with you in a minute.\"  I just hate it when bartenders don't make eye contact, don't look at the bar to see who MIGHT need a drink or food or something and you get ignored.",

It's supposed to be a coconut cake that has rum rizzled over it, topped by whipped cream, toasted coconut and a cherry. The cake was dry, and the rum flavor overwhelmingly  medicinal. I couldn't eat more than a couple of bites. Now, 20 minutes later, that medicinal taste strongly lingers.

When the manager Paul came to the table so I could complain, he really had nothing but excuses and wanted to blame on server when it came down to the fact to food and drinks took way too long cause 1 person was working. Our salads came out the same time as our food. Management was extremely rude I will not be going back!!!!!! Feel bad server who was ridiculed- need better management and scheduling!!!",

He helped us decide on what was needed for the number of people we were having and his communication as well as his execution went above and beyond.  Not only was the customer service phenomenal but also people raved about the food! Thank you Greg and RyeBrew for helping to make our event a memorable one.

Admittedly this is the first \"real\" cheesesteak sandwich I've ever had, as we supposedly don't do it right out in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nOf course you have to get a cheesesteak at some point on your philly trip, right? This was where we stopped. It's in the middle of a block in the heart of Old City, and looks like I hoped it would: a nice facade, but kind of like a hole-in-the-wall once you step inside. It was a little crampy in there, but we shared a table and all was well.\n\nWe all got steak+provolone, and it was delicious. I was full, but couldn't stop eating it (until I had 2 bites left... I was about to burst). Their fries are good, too. I may have to go back today to buy the tee shirt...",

  "text": "I never usually write reviews. But this place was so terrible, I had to write this one. I will never be coming back to this establishment for these four reasons.\n\n1. Host service was terrible, we were told it would be a 10-15 minute wait tops. We sat at the bar for 40 minutes with no update until our table was ready.\n\n2. Service was annoying. We were left unattended for the first 15 minutes, confused and hungry. We asked the runner that brought us a wrong order to bring us our server. And when we did get him, he had no idea if we were his table. \n\n3. FOOD. I wish I had taken photos of our table, because all the food was still there! The burger was underwhelming, weird patty, pickled jalapenos, and black shriveled bacon. We also got the french onion soup, wings, and tots. Overall the food was nasty, and overpriced. \n\n4. Last but not least, the management service was dreadful. We told our server how we did not like the burger w/ fries, and french onion soup (which we hadn't eaten). And the manager took off 10% of the burger off because the burnt bacon was apparently 10% of the order. Unfortunately, we drunkenly paid for our check, as we left still hungry by the end of the night.\n\nSAVE YOURSELF THE TIME AND MONEY.\n\nDO NOT GO TO SIX FEET UNDER.",

  "text": "Their food is really good.... BUT....... \nif you order to go, don't. I asked for truffle fries and asked for truffle bacon aioli, asked for chipotle ketchup for the build your own burger. I also told them no pickles because im allergic. I even had the server repeat the order back to me and she repeated it back correctly. When I received my Togo order, they gave me regular fries, regular garlic aioli, no ketchup at all, oh.. And pickles!!  For the truffle fries and trufflie aioli and chipotle ketchup, there's an upcharge. And i didnt get any of those. I was really disappointed. I understand its insanely busy, but the food allergy for the pickles? Cmon. \n\nThe two hour wait to dine in  is not worth it.  Did it once, took a server 20 mins just to ask us if we wanted something to drink. Told the server I'm allergic to pickles, and the kitchen STILL gave me pickles with my burger. Servers are friendly. I'm sure people in the kitchen are over whelmed, but i don't think its excusable to ignore customers food allergies when the server clearly rights it down. \n\nIts insanely busy. Once this place dies down and hopefully has more organization and decides to take reservations, I'll come back. It iust feels like the kitchen jips ur orders cause they dont think the customer will know the difference between truffle fries/aioli and the norm.",

No question just try as many as you please because there are no bad choices there. We ordered Gouda and onions along with hickory fries for starters. Not only did they take about 25 min but the onions were more raw than cooked.  Fries were smoky, crispy and tasty. There are about 5 mains to choose from. We all picked the steak. It's 12 oz so be hungry.  The steak was excellent but we had a lot of leftovers.  I would return for unique cocktails and appetizers but probably move on for dinner. Love the ambience but sadly not the food.  My stars are for beverages and service.",

We had already gotten our meals, and I was about to ask my waiter for clean silverware, but it was taking a long time to get his attention because they were so packed. I went to take a sip of my water, and gag, half the inside of the glass was coated with a thick layer of what looked like Alfredo sauce, and flecks of white stuff were floating in it. I had already taken a sip before actually looking at the glass, so of course I was thoroughly grossed out. Couldn't eat a bite after that. \nNo one ever cleared the table, and the waiter never came back to give me a chance to complain, despite my attempts to get his attention. He just came and hurriedly plopped the check on the table, either ignoring or not hearing me call out \"wait!\" as he sped off. By then I just wanted to be out of there, so I paid the bill rather than try to literally chase my waiter down. \nThis restaurant might have good food, I don't know, but there are lots and lots of other restaurants with good food in New Orleans.",

We both circled back on Mighty Melt because we were feeling comfort food. We ordered two sandwiches and watched as they made it. They dump literally 5 lbs of cheese on thick slices of bread on the grill and then broil it to melt the cheese. That's a really good way to ensure the cheese is melted all the way through because let's be honest, what's worse than a grilled cheese with half-melted cheese (nothing). They make their own little pickled veggies, and you can add a (small) side of fries to your sandwich for a discount. I will definitely come back here and possibly share a sandwich with a friend next time because they are DENSE.",

Also the menu was very pork heavy. Here's a quote from the waiter about the Matzo Ball soup. \"I haven't tried it but it sure smells good\". If you're going to do something like this, do it right. This place reeks of investors who could care less about the food. Dr. Brown's Cel-Ray, bacon, and fatty Pastrami doesn't make a good deli.",

  "text": "J Gilberts is usually our go to special restaurant but we were disappointed this time. At the table I ordered a Stella draft beer. It arrived with 1/3 foam. I asked the server to redo and he brought out a still beer with absolutely no head and filled exactly to the line on the glass leaving a noticeable unappealing gap between the beer level and rim.  After finishing that I ordered a second and received the same presentation.  If I'm spending well over $200 on a meal, I certainly don't expect for the server and bartender to play games with me over an extra ounce of beer. I should also mention that my $32 pork chop was overdone.",

The wait staff is Lifers; most are 50 something's grinding it out every day. They know their stuff and can make suggestions. They order with an IPad so they're not stuck in the past and service is good. \n\nEvery lunch I've gone there is families, single old dudes and Ladies on the patio. It's the kind of place older folks go to every day. They get the same: Sunny side up eggs, crisp bacon and a black coffee. I've been there twice and the same lady showed up again. \nI've only had the Cobb (see pic I posted),the BsT, and the shrimp crab bisque. I was happy with the salad and sandwich, but the bisque is kinda watered down.\nI liked my lunch there and think old school diners are awesome.\nDo yourself a favor and get the Bst it's a great twist on the Bacon,lettuce and tomato classic.",

The bartender was also really nice and added some rhubarb bitters to my Dark and Stormy. Dang if I lived near St. Louis I would come here all the time. The prices are also so reasonable ($6/pint for beer and $7 for my cocktail...). This place literally cannot be BEAT.",

I love the vegan bahn mi, lettuce wraps, roasted veg salad, fries, and black bean burger. They have a nice selection of vegetarian options and often a tasty soup I can eat as well. The outdoor seating area is good for people watching and the indoor seating is perfect for hiding. (Sometimes I come to have lunch + a beer in my pajamas. I work from home!) Polite and knowledgable staff, fast service, great location.",

There are always tables available because they have so many. This is one reason I come here often because I'm usually trying to find a place to get work done. \n\nI also like this place because they are one of very few coffee shops that are open until 10pm! It's very difficult to come home after work and find a place to go, because most cafes close at 6 or 7. Definitely check this place out!!",

All locally used foods and such a creative chef. My favorite thing in the menu is the butter cake!!  \nWe just spent our 10th anniversary there and it was by far the best experience. We got the best seat in the house, perfect for people watching. Our server Jeremy was amazing, recommended wine to go with my trout that paired perfectly. \n\nAnd after they found out it was our 10 yr they added a very special touch to the evening with a sweet message and the manager stopped off to say hi.

  "text": "Extremely disappointed! \nTook my niece, from out of town, to her father's favorite Haunt as a kid. Valley Green Inn has been a \"go-to\" for decades because of it's location, ambiance and (maybe not great but) good food.\nNot this time.\nShared the Caesar Salad, which was large and tasty. The lettuce was huge, barely cut up.\nTwo of us ordered the \"Strip Steak\". It really takes some nerve to call what we got a Strip Steak. It was less than half an inch thick. Almost had to wonder if they only had one steak left and divided it, to have two portions.\nOrdered them Medium rare but how do you cook a steak this thin to any given temperature? One was over done the other well done at one end and rare at the other.\n$32 for this steak that looked like something that should have been made into cheese steak!\nWish I had the nerve to tell them to take it back.\n\nMy husband ordered Sea Scallops - which was a better choice but still pretty bad. Received 5 scallops all different sizes, all smaller than a half dollar. All over cooked.\n\nOur waitress was a gem!",

  "text": "Tir na Nog can be a really hard place to like somtimes.  The drinks are expensive, half the food isn't great, any girl in your party is going to hit on by 30 yr old former frat dudes in their young republican costumes and  the weekend cover bands need to learn something other than Journey or Fountains of Wayne.\n\nThat being said, there are some things that make Tir a blip on the Center City br radar.  The bartenders and staff make some good goddamn drinks.  I'm buzzed after one (and I was in the Navy), but I don't make the yuck face after every sip.  Perfect hiding of drinks that have too much booze in them.  They have a good beer selection and even when busy, your drink gets remembered and you feel well taken care of by everyone from the doormen to the busboys.\n\nI do end up spending half my time there in the alley smoking, but they let you bring your drinks out there and you don't have to be coralled in the smoker's cage like some places.  \n\nHalf of their food may suck, but the other half is perfect snack fare off the bar menu at least.  I recommend the popcorn shrimp or the sliders as table sharefood.  \n\nGo when you already have a heavy buzz and at least three of your friends are going to be there.  Be prepared for semi-cougar, really drunk and probably married broads to 1.) spill a drink on you 2.) make you dance with them to an awful cover of Stacy's Mom 3.) Fall down\n\nI've had some really good times there, but I once saw a really chubby Asian guy with a beard take his shirt off while dancing by himself to Billie Jean.  Then he walked around the bar hanging his shirt off his finger hitting on all the girls still lingering around at closing time.  It's really a crapshoot.  You decide if it is worth the risk.",
