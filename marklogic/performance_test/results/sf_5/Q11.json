She offers all of the traditional barber shop services (cuts, shaves, beard and neck trims, hot towel, etc.) at very good prices. The shop itself is very clean and well kept, I'll definitely be returning. The barbers at this shop are independent so if you want to reach Rebekah directly you have to ask for her.",

The service was some of the worst I've ever had. We sat for 20 minutes before we even got water. WATER! I came here for a work lunch, I don't have 20 minutes to wait on water. The server was extremely kind at first until we asked another server for water after 20 minutes, then she got sassy. We ordered drinks and food that didn't show up and when we asked for them she said her boss had questions. If he had questions then ask them! Don't make me ask where the food is for you to finally tell me you have questions about my order. Which her questions were around what we ordered, great fun! I'll only get to go next time, the service is just horrible.",

The best part was the lunch special that gives you the drink and fries for free (normally a $2.25 add on) for free when you purchase a burger or a sandwich. \nI got the breaded tenderloin which was more money than the burger but was really big and worth it. my son got a double burger and fries and my daughter got the kid's chicken nugget meal with fries and a drink. Good fries too! Thick and tasty rather than tiny shoestring ones.  \nWe all ate it fast and were stuffed.   I wished we had saved room for ice cream or a milkshake. they looked great.",

(I was up at midnight for a dew days two months out to get one.. 'spoiler')\n\nMet up with the Mrs. and some friends for an evening of food and drink and we were not disappointed.\n\nGreeted with the standard house made pickles of celery, carrots and jerusalem artichokes, we all agreed that the chef's tasting was the only way for us.\n\nThe salatim (salads of the day) lined our table with beets, cabbage, eggplant, carrots, fennel and cauliflower were front and center, each prepared to bring out the purest flavor of that ingredient, lightly flavored and much better to share. \n\nThe signature hummus arrived, but this time donning some roasted cauliflower and their ever so fluffy pita.  When you need, and want, more just ask.  You want it.\n\nSmaller dishes throught the night included grilled duck hearts, haloumi cheese, fried cauliflower, a crispy mushroom dish, brussels sprouts, and a ceviche made its way to our table.  All hits, no misses.\n\nThe piece de resistance arrived with smokey sweet lamb (brined, smoked and braised, a multi day procedure) and a dish I've been wanting to share was superb, better in fact, if at all possible than our first trip. Garnished with chickpeas and accompanied by that crispy Persian rice, rich with spices and the alluring crack one you've broken the shell.  It's definitely one of the best parts of the meal.\n\nBrandishing out now growing stomachs, dessert!  Pumpkin kanofi (rich and sweet), apple sorbet (tart and refreshing), pistachicio upside down cake (well balanced and pleasantly pistachio flavored.. , and my personal favorite, the malabi custard (think panna cotta-flan hybrid flavored with rose.\n\nAnother truly epic meal and one that everyone should try to get a chance to experience.\n\n*the wine pairing was well received with a few unique ones that went well with each round of food.",

Although it is very modern and on state street there are many negatives that outweigh this:\n\n1. The hotel room is the smallest I've ever seen (including Europe). It took me back to my dorm days which is not a good thing.\n\n2. The hotel is basically on top of train tracks - and the train runs ALL night. The horn is incredibly loud and hard to sleep through - even for a deep sleeper like myself.\n\n3. They lost our reservation... even though we showed them the confirmation email. They then tried to charge us a higher rate then was shown on the confirmation email.\n\n4. The bathroom has the worst shower I think I've ever seen in a hotel room. You could literally sit on the toliet and take a shower... there is about four square feet of shower space, and the shower head is on a wall three feet in front of the toilet - with only flimsy shower curtains cordoning off the area. Water from the shower covers the floor, there's no way to prevent it.\n\nDon't stay here!",

  "text": "Not sure who to contact about this, but this station stole money from me this afternoon. I went in and paid $10, prepay for gas. When I went to fill up, the pump told me to pay the cashier. Went back to tell the attendant that the pump wasn't working and she said it was because I had put the handle back down, and it would pay the money back to my card. I had to pay again. I tried to explain that it did it from the beginning, which was why I was telling her. She copped SERIOUS attitude, and said too bad you have to pay again. So I paid at the pump. I went in to get my receipt for my pay at the pump, and she said to expect 2 charges cause I over filled my tank. Um, no maam. I showed her, on the receipt where she had originally charged the wrong pump, and I asked her to reverse it. She said she couldnt do that, and tried to rip the receipts out of my hand. And then said good luck getting your money back. I've never had this kind of experience anywhere. Called my bank and put a stop payment on the charge, but you guys really need to do something. Seeing as other reviews have also had this happen to other people per google, I strongly suggest going to the shell a couple of blocks down unless you just want to get stolen from.   I will happily provide photos of my receipts.",

I finally left when Fox & Friends was playing on the tv when I walked in. \n\nWhat a difference a haircut at JAG's makes! This is a seriously great barbershop. Casual, yet all about getting down to business. I was amazed at and very happy with how quiet it was. Not because business was slow. Business was brisk with 8 chairs filled the entire time I was there. It was quiet because the barbers here are pros concentrating on their work. Truly good barbers don't need to chew your ear off, thank you.\n\nI booked an appointment with Juan (the owner, I believe) for $2 more than a walk-in wait for one of the other barbers. I didn't see a bad haircut from any of the other barbers walk out of the room while I was there, but I feel like I robbed the place getting a haircut from the man himself. He is way underpriced and way humble. \n\nExcellent!",

First off, clearly they are one of the most popular restaurants in Media, so the restaurant was packed to the gills. We arrived 10 mins past our reservation, and had to wait another 10 mins to be seated. We were seated in a back corner, in a main traffic area from the kitchen. We were lucky we didn't wind up with plates full of food on our laps several times.  There should have never have been a table in that spot.  Our waitress was pleasant, but we waited 40 minutes for an appetizer that never came.  We were starving and finally our entrees came. The waitress never checked back in until halfway through our entrees were finished, and asked if our appetizer ever came. Then the host came over and apologized about the appetizer and offered it to us for free and we took it home. Overall, the food was good, but the restaurant clearly packs too many people in and overloads the staff.   Based on their reputation we expected better.",

It is super comfortable and there were string lights which made me feel like I was at a cute little garden party.\n\nOur table for 4 decided to order a bunch of food and share it family style, which I highly recommend! We started with the charred Brussels sprouts (obviously because they're my obsession), which were a little sweet, crunchy, and delicious. We also got the springtime som tam (double spicy)- great fresh veggies, coal roasted sweet potatoes - salty and sweet and oh so good, hush puppies - pretty good but just tasted fried to me, the chili butter yard bird - cooked very well, the herb rubbed gulf fish - great flavor, and the spare ribs - I didn't try them but my family really enjoyed them. All of the food was unique, thought out, and very flavorful. There wasn't one thing that we ordered that I didn't really enjoy, so I know that all of the other menu items are probably amazing as well. And the food was affordable! All of that food plus 2 beers and tip was around $125 - a steal for dinner for 4.\n\nI'm sad that it took me so long to visit Marjie's but I will definitely be back! \n\nFood - 4.5 stars\nPrice - 4.5 stars\nService - 4 stars \nAtmosphere - 3 stars inside, 4.5 stars outside",

  "text": "Eh, this place is fine\" is the thought that keeps coming up as I figure out how to write this review. In my stable of establishments to patron, this is filed under \"Go to if you're looking to give the impression of a fancy restaurant and food doesn't matter.\n\nNone of the food is bad, per se, but I also cannot think of one dish that has knocked my socks off. The same can be said for the drinks. I ordered a apple cider mule last time I was here and I'm not sure what the problem was, but it wasn't good and that is something that is hard to mess up in my opinion. I also had the filet and the cream of tomato soup. The filet was very tender and good, bit the flavor wasn't great if that makes sense. Finally, the  soup was too thick and salty for my tastes and that is saying a lot considering I love salty food! I hate to give a restaurant an okay review, but okay has just been my opinion of the food here.\n\nPrices seemed decent but close to the more than I would have liked to pay' end considering the service was spotty and the food was mostly average.\n\nOther than that, the ambiance was great for getting dressed up and a romantic dinner. Low lighting, and polite wait staff makes this a great go to for dates if you're trying to impress someone early in your relationship.",

The sauce is served on the side and is just the right kind of spicy.  The sweet potato fries are particularly perfect (and I am super picky about my sp fries!) and have a hint of cinnamon sugar about them.  The homemade salsa was chock full of fresh ingredients that tasted like they were in the garden this morning.  All in all, this was an amazing place to feed our family as we passed through.

There was plenty of meat on the sandwich, just the right amount of mustard and pickle in my opinion.  I would say this was a very good cuban sandwich.  I'm not an expert on cuban sandwiches as they usually are not my first choice.\n\nI also decided to try their italian sandwich.  This has lettuce, tomato, onion, fresh basil and oregano, gouda cheese, provolone, smoked ham, pepperoni, salami, italian dressing, topped with a shaved asiago cheese.    This has a great taste.  The choice of cheeses and meats blend well together.  All of the meats and cheeses taste very fresh.  \n\nI would definitely go back.  I however would not go out of my way to eat here again.  I did find the prices very reasonable, and the food quite tasty.  If I'm next door at lunch time again, I'll stop in.",

  "text": "WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.\n\n3 weeks prior to arriving in Nola for my bestfriend's bachelorette party, I contacted this establishment to schedule a custom blend appointment. Note, the website instructs that appointments are recommended but not required. After being told they were unable to schedule me for an appt at that time, I asked if it would be okay to walk in to see if we could be accommodated as the website says appointments are recommended but not required. On the day of our visit, we were rudely turned away and told we could not be accommodated. A few things were disturbing: 1. I was told it'd be alright to come in w/o an appt. 2. Her attitude, body language and tone were all incredibly mean spirited and aggressive. 3. The bride clearly arrived ready to spend at least $90 and she was not even offered an alternative such as a ready made perfume or whatever else they might have had.\n\nSome of us travelled from as far as DC and the way we were received was very unbecoming of a business which is supposed to cater to clientele in the one of the most celebratory times of their lives. Very disappointing. Luckily there is a Lush just down the street.",

The area where we sat was dirty - could feel the crumbs on the sofa-like seating and had to dust them off.  Bleh, not a good start.  We ordered from the a la carte menu.  We started with the Casablanca salad which was good, but under-flavored.  We had the chicken tagine and chicken kabobs for entrees.  The chicken tagine was awful.  The seasoning on it was too dense and pungent to eat and the chicken itself was bland and on the dry side.  The kabobs were also bland and dry.  The couscous that accompanied the kabobs was simply awful - bland and tasteless.  \nFor the life of me, I can't understand why a Moroccan restaurant serves pita bread rather than traditional Moroccan bread.  But, even still, the pita was dry and on the harder side, not overwhelmingly fresh.  \nWe did not get dessert.  We did have the Moroccan mint tea, which was good and tasted authentically Moroccan.  \nThe kicker was we weren't able to use the gift certificate for the a la carte menu, only for the \"feasts\".  \nWe won't be using the gift certificate at all because we won't be going back.  \nTo top it off, the belly dancer was not good.",

  "text": "I went to this Cheesecake Factory because I thought it would be a nice change of pace from the Willow Grove location I normally go to. And boy ... was I wrong. It started with the staff who immediately was not friendly. I know they were busy, I understand that but simple niceties would have been appreciated. Then the experience went down hill from there. My friend and I both ordered and my friend was delivered the wrong dish. Okay the waiter comped it but he made it seem as if it was my friend's fault when really the waiter just misheard him apparently. I am sure there are plenty of people who do order something and when they get it say it's not what they ordered (shame on these people) but the waiter clearly misheard him and so when my friend asked what it was, he told him what it was and said that is what he ordered. It was a battle about taking it back, my friend hates wasting and was going to eat it anyway but the waiter offered to swap it (+1) but his tone just seemed very peeved. \"I can swap it but we cook it fresh so it's gonna take awhile\". Okay ... Then my food that I ordered was super liquid-y. I had a dish with a cream sauce and instead of cream it was soup. The sauce didn't even stick to my pasta. It just tastes watery and bland. We had to ask for more bread and drinks , normally we get asked if we want more. And then to top it all off the place, as another yelper had mentioned. It needed a face lift. I realized once my plate was clear that below it was a giant crater from which the entire top surface of the table was removed (the faux marble effect ) to reveal its undersurface - rough and raw. We skipped out on Cheesecake after everything that has gone wrong thus far. And then we left to use the bathroom and there were not even enough bathrooms I waited and waited and had to leave. With a restaurant that huge why do you only have 3 bathrooms? I know that is not the restaurants fault, but it was just another sour note on my first and only poor Cheesecake Factory experience - and I have had a drink spilled on me. Needless to say, I won't be going back!",

I met with Jessica Coltra, treatment coordinator, and she went over options.  If you have been hesitant because of the cost, you do not have to worry.  Orthodontic Partners has amazing finance options that make it a \"no brainer.\" They even have a full payment option!\n\nOrthodontic Partners has four locations. The office staff will ensure that you are seen at the location that best suites your needs.  When calling the office, the staff is professional and makes scheduling easy.\n\nDrs. Bruntz and Walton created a gorgeous smile.  They are caring, friendly, knowledgeable and pleasant.  They are the 1 percent provider in the nation for Invisalign.  You know you are getting the very best.  Yes, there were some changes to my habits but it was to achieve a healthy bite and a radiant smile.  The staff is wonderful in explaining the necessary accommodations.\n\nIn closing, do it for yourself! Don't put it off!  I promise you will be elated that you did.  I wish to stars I would have done this years ago.  I have been smiling from ear to ear.  Thank you to the entire staff for making my experience phenomenal.",

  "text": "This is actually owned by Brunswick which totally kicked up a notch for me because in all of my past experiences of all alleys combined, Brunswick knows their game when it comes to maintaining the lanes. The oil patterns have been fantastic each time and if it is too oily, just bowl one game with wiping off the ball with the bowling ball towel each time to help displace and remove the excess oil with your own pattern.  \n\nMy first impression of the interiors was yeah, they're outdated with the wall decor, but the carpet looked 1-3 years new, unless I am wrong. The walls and back wall of the alley are very faded and compels me to ask the owner if I can be commissioned to touch up on the paint! ha!\n\nI had totally forgotten that Brunswick is one of the few companies that does the red-pin hours where if you do knock down that one red pin in a frame, you win either drinks, food, or a free game. When you do encounter that and win, go to the front desk immediately to receive your voucher other wise you lose that chance.\n\nThere are leagues and from what I have seen so far, the people that participate are pretty good and I wouldn't mind joining a league at some point when there's one suitable for my schedule.\n\nAlso, don't forget to take a look at the back of your receipts as there's a couple that gives away coupons of BOGO games or $5 games, etc. But I have noticed the billing print fades before the month is up to prove that you got this receipt before the 30 days are up to use the coupon. Kinda sucked.\n\nOne negative thing about this particular location is that it's tucked on a commercial street between commercial or industrial type of buildings with semi-weak lighting outside that it may make it dangerous for a lone person to park away from the bowling alley at night. Just be aware of your surroundings even though this area isn't overall \"dangerous\".",

  "text": "My husband and I were traveling together and this hotel experience was less than desirable. I booked this stay through the Southwest Airlines website since we would need travel/shuttle service to the airport in Indianapolis the next morning. We checked in and went to our room. The exterior and lobby of the hotel was nice however the rooms were very dated and the King room was extremely small. It felt warm in the room so we turned the air down to 70 (it was set at 77) after about an hour it did not feel any cooler so we moved the air down again to 67 and called the front desk. The lady said she would send someone right up. A little over an hour and a half later we still had not seen anyone but we had to be up for an early flight in about 4 1/2 hours so I called down again to the desk and explained that we would \"tough it out\" due to our early departure. There was no apology, just an \"okay, thanks for letting us know.\" Throughout the night the room reached about 78 degrees. Once we left the room to check out and went to the lobby we realized the air conditioning was out in the entire hotel. It was about 85-90 degrees in the lobby. Upon check out I asked the man at the desk of I needed to do anything since I was leaving my car for a week. He said, \"yea, it's $6/day... You'll need to pay.\"  I told him I booked through the Southwest site and was supposed to have had the \"park and fly\" rate. He said, \"well you don't so you need to pay.\" He was extremely rude and again no apology for the extreme heat in our rooms. I asked him politely if there was anything he could do about the charge since i was under the impression I would not have to pay and our room being nearly 80 degrees and he responded with, \"well it's hot down here too!\" I about lost my shit! I told him he GETS paid to be there and I PAID to be there! He then went to \"get security.\" I'm not sure why no one was yelling but the security \"guard\" came out and said it was fine to park \"this time\" for no charge. I quickly responded, \"no worries, due to your lack of decent customer service, I won't be staying here again.\" Something as simple as an apology and a slight compensation would have prevented this review being so negative.",

  "text": "I played Yelp Roulette for Castleton.  They were some other options I wanted to try like burgers and BBQ, but I had that recently. #40 on the list was Joella's.  As I looked at the menu, it claimed the winning spot for my supper.\n\nJoella's is a little different from your standard fast food chicken places.  You get to choose your level of spice, more side options, and dipping sauces you do not get from other establishments. \n\nI went with the Jumbo tenders at the Ella's Fav level with red-skin mashed potatoes and green beans.  For checking in to Yelp, I also got a big wing, which I almost had to argue about receiving.  The tenders were big, juicy, and on the spicy side.  The green beans were ok but the mashed potatoes was very creamy and delicious. The wing had good flavor but has the flaws of most wings, not enough meat and some maneuvering.\n\nOne sauce comes with the meal and one sauce is just not good enough for this sauceaholic. So I chose 5 and paid an extra 50 cents for each one.  A description of the sauces I tried are: Jojo (Mustard BBQ), Bama white (a lot of horseradish), cheerwine BBQ (Cheerwine is a chery flavored soda), pimento ranchero (ranch with pimento cheese), and my favorite  - the spiked honey.  I am having a hard time thinking of a sauce similar to it.  Either way, that's the sauce I'm choosing next time then either the Jojo or Pimento Ranchero.\n\nFor dessert, they have pie in a jar.  I had the chocolate peanut butter one which was very fulfilling. I get to keep the jar too.\n\nSweet tea was Indiana level sweet tea which means barely sweet.  But it was fresh-brewed. \n\nI thought of Joella's as a better Southern Pop-eyes.  If you love fried chicken with some heat, come give it a try.",

  "text": "Goody's is a cute local ice cream parlor that has been around since I was a kid. And just as when I was a child, I still get giddy and excited getting to come here! Located in the equally adorable Hyde Park, you can take your dessert to-go and explore the area during the warmer months. \n\nThe shop itself is adorable from the inside and out. It gives you a classic old-timey kind of feel. When you walk in, you are immediately greeted by the smell of fresh caramel popcorn. There is a long display of delectable chocolates and candies with a wide variety to choose from. \n\nNow their specialty and what most people come here for is their handmade ice cream. Every flavor I've ever tried has not disappointed. Their sundaes are to die for, and their make-your-own sundaes allow for creativity and absolute satisfaction. I asked for one with a waffle bowl with one scoop of chocolate cheesecake and another of coffee, complete with marionberry toppings. I was all sugared out by the time I finished, but in a good way!\n\nGoody's is a classic in Boise that everyone needs to visit if in town. Do yourself a favor and check it out!",

Our server was TERRIBLE! Gave us the wrong food, didnt hardly speak a word to us, was not courteous and didn't even say anything as we were leaving. The food is decent however it is really overpriced. $13.30 for an order of 10 wings is a lot. Their pizza price is the same. $25 for a large and it is not anything special. There are much better pizza places to spend your money and we won't be coming back to this restaurant.",

Now in February my son has picked out some frames from a store online, and we just need this location to release his prescription so the other company can make the glasses I have already paid for. THE STAFF AT THIS STORE DOES NOT ANSWER THE PHONE. The store is open according to their website, but when I have called a few times a day on different days for a week, letting the phone ring for 15-20 minutes at a time, no one answers. Called the 800#, and no answer there, either. Tomorrow I am off work and am going to go there in person and ask what the hell and get them to call this company in front of me so I know it gets done.

The services themselves are just fine and generally  pretty well done.\nThe sales pitch and upsell for products that begins about midwax is the element that has pushed me over the edge to discontinue. I am uncomfortable because of the push. One waxer walked out to the product wall and took a product down and placed it with the receptionist while talking, indicating that I would be buying. Um, no. \n\nCouple that with the what seems like an endless rotation of staff at the front desk that leaves for some serious disorganization at any point (I received 5 phone calls about reminders for the same appointment in the duration of 24 hours. 3 calls from the same person, same message. WTH?).\n\nGoodbye, EWC.",

The manager took a personal call in the middle of taking my payment. Their inability to cut a pizza should be studied by science. On the plus side they finally made enough money to cover the insulation on the outside of the building. It only took 3 years, no joke. Pizza Hut corporate should not let them fly their flag.

  "text": "After living in Philly for 4 years and considering myself a self-proclaimed \"foodie\", this dining experience was long anticipated. My sister in law made a reservation 2 months in advance, waiting up until midnight to snag an 8pm reservation last night for my father's birthday. Zahav was so kind to print a personalized happy birthday message on the menu, which my father thought was cool and kept a menu for himself.\n\nWe had a party of 6 and opted for the tasting menu. The waitstaff was very attentive, thorough, and explained the dishes as they were coming out. For the table, we got two orders of the salatim (six vegetable salads) and to my surprise, the cabbage was my favorite! I could eat bowls of it!\n\nNext we got to choose two hummus dishes, in which we chose the Turkish (served warm) - this tasted like mashed potatoes - consistency and all. But I enjoyed it nonetheless. The other hummus we chose was the tehina, which was tasty, but it was more of a \"typical\" hummus has there was no special twist or flavoring. The laffa was fresh, hot, and aplenty. They brought us out a third laffa upon request.\n\nAh, then the mezze course. Each of us got to choose two, so we ended up with 12 mezze. Now these plates are small but 12 was a LOT. My favorites were the amba pickled egg and the kibbe naya. My family really seemed to like the grilled haloumi. I even tried a duck heart, which was new for me!\n\nBy this point we were FULL but had two courses left! Each of us chose an entree, but we doubled up on the hanger steak and opted out of the mushroom. Each kebab was just big enough for each of us to have about 2-3 bites. The bronzino was cooked perfectly and very flavorful - my favorite part was the fresh tzatziki that it was served over. Rice accompanied the kebabs. Honestly I would have been fine without this entire course, but that's only because..\n\nHAD to save room for dessert! Wow - this course stole the show. The waitstaff brought out a candle for my father's birthday and - just wait - EIGHT desserts for six people. We were blown away. We got two of each dessert - wow! My dad could not stop raving about the olive oil cake while my mom and sister in law enjoyed the decadent malabi custard. My personal favorite was the sorbet over the coconut rice pudding, YUM! The least favorite of the group seemed to be the chocolate tehina mousse. \n\nThe dinner ended up taking about 3 hours, and we enjoyed every minute. Can not wait for my next opportunity to return to Zahav!",

Super friendly staff and they offer a wide range of different coffee drink options which is surprising since the place is so small. They have 1 power outlet and not really a place to sit and work all day but it's great if you are watching a show at the Straz and need your coffee fix. They offer seating outside and no bathrooms. Sitting inside you can hear the show that's performing through the walls which I thought was amusing. They serve Buddy Brew coffee so you can't go wrong with that since it's a local favorite. Good luck finding parking but if you're in the area or going to the Straz Center I recommend checking out this place.",

  "text": "This place is like shopping in the ghetto for a car.\n\nThe epitemy of every used car salesman cliche you can think of lurks here. \n\nWhen my brother needed a car and had not so great credit we decided to shop here. Since I'm the car buying expert I went along to handle the financing and negotiating end of it. Needless to say, as a female, this did not go over well with the sales staff.\n\nHe ended up with a decent car but the stereo they installed stuck out of the dash and they said they'd repair it. He brings it into them a couple days later as arranged and when he picks it up that night the stereo is in but the air and heat now don't work.\n\nHe brings it back as instructed, the next day and they fix the heat. Brings it back the next day so they can fix the air but is told it will be a couple days and he should get a rental. Why should he pay when he bought the car three days ago?? Because it;s \"not their fault they have to order a part\"\n\nOk, thank goodness for that lemon law rule. Once I threatened the owner with filing it (becauase we were on our third trip in for the same issue) the owner got loud rude and obnoxious with me. He ended up screaming at me \"Why don't you just bring it back then!?\" OK buddy, will do, but since they still had it (Duh) all I needed to do was to go in person and say \"We've decided to take you up on the deal, return the car and we've cancelled the financing\"\n\nAmazing how this jerk turned into a now smooth talking business man who will do anything he can to help the car along.\n\nNo kidding, within the time of us being there to \"negotiate\" the return the air is fixed, the stereo is set, and brother is on his way. (He really needed a car with financing or we would have gone elsewhere)\n\nThe ONLY reason to come here is to obtain financing with bad credit, the rest of us luckily can go elsewhere. But keep in mind, even with bad credit, you can apply directly to Mid Atlantic finance company in Clwr (that's where Park AUto Mall finances through ) and get a loan directly without having to go through a car lot first.",

  "text": "Met some friends for a late lunch and margaritas! It was all 3 of our first times. I considered sitting outside, but there were 3 of us in our party and they said outdoor seating was only for 2 people. Slightly smells weird inside. I've gone to plenty of Mexican restaurants that remind me of this place. Our server was quite attentive. \n\nThe salsa was thin red sauce with no chunky veggies or cilantro; for my taste that was a disappointment. We ordered margaritas. My frozen mango margarita was fabulous! $5.99 for 16 oz! Someone else in my party ordered a frozen strawberry, but their machine was down because it was completely liquid syrup. Not sure why he even served it in the first place, but he replaced it. She tried an on the rock classic margarita. It was bland, watery, and just kind of gross, sadly. We all tried it. Feeling extremely guilty, she asked to switch to the frozen mango (3rd drink was a charm!) He gladly replaced it and understood. \n\nOur food came out very quickly and was piping hot! (I look for steam--it makes me so happy. I like the option of burning my palate.) I ordered the fajita chimichanga! It looks small, but I ended up taking the last bites home. Some time waiting for the check, someone knocked over a nearly empty glass on its side on to the table. It broke. Another employee immediately came over and said it would be $5 for the broken glass. At first this seems almost reasonable, but as we were thinking about it, none of us have ever been charged for breaking a glass at a restaurant. \n\nI've worked in restaurants before, glass breaks. It happens. I think the $5 charge for their cheap thin glass was silly, and it just was a bad ending to our first visit there. Overall it's pretty good, but I'd like to see them work on a few things.",

Alex has been walking my Penny for the past year, and does a fantastic job.  She is enthusiastic, trustworthy, and always goes above and beyond for my beloved little dog.  After filling out a detailed dossier about your pet (monster), Monster Minders pairs you with a walker based on your needs.  I have the 5X per week walk package, and my Penny gets a walk every M-F afternoon at some point within a two hour window.  After the walk, your personal page on the Monster Minders website is updated with a short note, and I enjoy checking in from the office to see how Penny's walk went.  The Minder also leaves a handwritten note in your home that is a treat to read after getting home from work.  You can manage your account and future walks easily from the website, and adding or removing walks is stress-free.   Carrie, one of the owners, also frequently checks in via email in case you need anything, which is much appreciated.  I just love that Penny has a nice walk every afternoon while I'm at work.  If you are looking for a dog walking service and want to support an excellent small business, look no further than Monster Minders!",

  "text": "the US Mint is always a great place to showcase music in the heat of summer.  the cajun zydeco fest was over the top.  several stages, lots of food booths, and artists.

Lost bayou ramblers?   yes INdeed.    and sunpie,   Bruce SunPie Barnes, the big chief of the northside skull and bone gang.   Love me some bruce....   and love me some of that lucious LEMON sorbet in a cone.  YUM....\n\nit was super hot out, and the trees provide a nice shade, and the esplanade side of this fest, or any fest at the mint, because of the breeze from the river.   then there was that free sample booth of luzianne iced tea, that helped cool me off.\n\nanyhow, to give you an idea of this fest, music wise, here's the line up\nSATURDAY, JUNE 11\nESPLANADE AVE.

I highly recommend this fest, because you can wander through the market, and catch more, and then tomato fest too.\n\nof course, there's the naked bike ride on saturday, but I didn't catch any of it, I was too busy dancin.   \n\nwe closed the evening by supporting our local boys on bourbon street,   the bonoffs at the opera house, and waylon thibideaux at the tropical isle.\n\nthere's PRIDE on bourbon street.\n\nsupport your local coonass'\n\nand like waylon said, \"the way to a musicians heart, is through his liver on a hot day\".   tip em, and buy em drinks\n\n\neyeeeeeEEEEEEE!",

  "text": "My husband planned a fabulous birthday evening for my 40th along with a group of friends.  While the Paramour is beautiful and in the past we experienced a nice dinner, this visit was not exactly great.  When we arrived my husband planned for appetizers to be served with drinks in a private setting while we waited for dinner, several of the apps were more room temp than hot when served.  The space we sat in was very pretty but not at all private, At dinner we sat in a very nice private dining room, several guests were quite pleased with their meals, mine was less than mediocre.  The following day my husband reviewed the bill and noticed we spent $100's less  than the anticipated amount.  My husband contacted the manager and asked if they would offer a gift certificate/credit and mentioned that the servers and party planner never mentioned that we had not spent the amount allotted. Much to our dismay and disappointment, the Paramour was less that cooperative refused to do anything and more or less indicated it was our loss.  just very sad as we have shared this story with friends and co-workers we have discovered this to be more a common occurrence than a rarity.  We will not return due to the horrible customer service, mediocre meal and shadow they cast upon the memories of my birthday..",

  "text": "We were looking forward to a wonderful evening at Oceano Bistro with a large group to celebrate two birthdays. We had heard good things about this place and gave it a try. A couple of people in our group loved this place in the past. I don't know if the quality has slipped or if this is the new normal, but the whole group left feeling very underwhelmed by the experience. Being Restaurant Week, most of us ordered off of the special menu with a few regular menu items added. The problems started when the servers forgot to bring out two of our chowders as the first course. Eight people in our group of ten were eating while two of us had to wait until they were almost finished before we had to chance to tell them that we had not been served our first course yet. Once the chowder came, it was pretty bland. It wasn't bad, just needed more salt, pepper and spices. Next came our main course - mine was trout with mushrooms and green beans in a mushroom sauce. The trout was excellent. The mushrooms were very good, but were very sparse. Needed many more mushrooms. The green beans were too raw for me. I like a little fresh snap and crispness to my al dente vegetables, but these were way, way too raw and had no flavor either. Dessert course was either bread pudding with ice cream or a cupcake. The bread pudding was good, but the cupcake was very dry and non-edible. \n\nLastly, they did nothing to recognize the two of us that chose to celebrate our birthday at their establishment. No drink on the house or complimentary appetizer or anything. A small gesture goes a long way in showing your appreciation for your patrons and making a lasting impression. \n\nThis place was trendy and nice all around, but I was not impressed. The next time I celebrate my birthday, it will be at another establishment. There are plenty of wonderful places in which to spend my time and money.",

The owners are warm, friendly, helpful women.  You can see how they carefully pick for you so you just have to find the right fit.  Great for people who want to spend their money on high quality items without Saks Fith Avenue prices.  You know what the French say!  A few good pieces is better than a closet full of low quality items.  That's what you'll find here.  Lot of couture and boutique quality stuff for \"off the rack\" prices.  ENJOY.",

I wanted to like it so bad that I feel guilty for writing it but I have to be honest. The service and staff were amazing ( totally sweet and accommodating to our baby. It's a tiny place but they squeezed us in with a high chair and were very nice!) but the food was just ok. Pot stickers were tasty. I had pork chow fun with no gravy and it was relatively flavorless and kind of greasy. I don't usually say food is greasy cause I don't usually mind it and also it's like duh it's Chinese food did you think you were eating healthy? But it was like too much. Maybe better with the gravy? But the gravyless looked so yummy in the pictures! Husband got roasted duck with stir fried noodles and honestly it tasted the same as mine other than the flavor of the duck. Kinda flavorless and greasy. So weird considering all the great things I've heard! An off night? Got the wrong dishes? Maybe but two dishes being not tasty is odd I could see one but both...hmmm?! I will give them another shot though considering all the good I've heard and hope for a different experience.",

  "text": "Definitely very appealing vegan fare... I love that the menu is short and every dish seems to have a lot of thought put in it. I ordered the noodles and the cauliflower 65.\n\nNoodles were just amazing, right from the texture of the noodles to the spice balance of the sauce/broth  and the friend mushrooms, it was all perfect. I ate the last bit of the sauce in the bowl.\n\nCauliflower 65 to me was ok, the pieces of the crisp (papad) didn't seem too fresh as they were not crispy like they should be.\n\nLoved the halo halo dessert, quite innovative mix of flavors. \n\nOverall great experience and I surely want to go and try other items on the menu. Most importantly, presentation was GREAT, hard to find in vegan restaurants. So this is a perfect place for a nice vegan dinner date.\n\nMy biggest qualm about this place is the pricing, way too high for a frequent visit.",

  "text": "My daughter got a little confused and thought she was buying Imagine Dragon tickets for West Palm Beach but instead she purchased in Tampa. She managed to get us floor so we decided to keep them and take a road trip. Since we had floor and it's first come first serve we came very early to make sure we got to the front of the line. Unfortunately for us we stood in the wrong line for a really long time. By the time we figured out what was going on we were in the back of the line of people heading to the floor. They handed out wrist bands to signify who got to be on the floor. That part was great but better signs marking the respective lines would have been helpful. Security was pretty quick but I never bring anything in with me except one credit card, my phone, and a car key. \n\nOnce inside things worked out better. We managed to find a spot along the rail and began what had to be the hottest night of my life. It was so hot that I felt dizzy at times. They sold expensive but necessary frozen lemonade on the floor which saved me. It was cash only which forced a necessary trip to the expensive cash machine. \n\nThe show was amazing. We were so close to the band and they dropped balloons and shot out confetti several times during the show. This was the most civilized crowd I have ever been in. No one pushed or tried to cut in front of me. We all just danced and had the best time. In Broward it is a fight to keep your spot. I loved the show and it made all of the uncomfortable standing and heat worth it. \n\nAfter the show arena attendants were rude about patrons leaving. I sat down for a minute to catch my breath after standing for four hours in extreme heat and I was screamed at. Since we came early we were in the front of the parking lot. Leaving was another nightmare. No one moved around us for over an hour. We were completely stuck. Parking attendants to direct traffic would have been appreciated. The concert let out at 11 and we didn't get on the road until well after 12 AM. If I came back I would take Brett M.'s advice about parking at the exit and taking a long walk to the entrance in order to be able to leave. \n\nI think how much you enjoy your show at this arena depends on the weather. This arena has covered seating but it is open on the sides with lawn seating. If there is lightening in the area they will stop the show or cut it short. That is what happened to us the night before in Palm Beach. The finale was changed to acoustic because of bad weather as people were forced out of the arena. I am so happy we decided to keep the Tampa tickets where we saw the full ending of the concert. It seems easier to get good tickets here as opposed to more populated Broward County and my daughter lives in Orlando so I may be back.",

  "text": "Delicious. I went there with some family friends a couple weeks ago, and it was hard not to drool all over the menu. I am a big fan of the prices, the small, intimate setting, and the overall laid back vibe. Building up to my visit, every single person told me to get the Krispy Kreme Bread Pudding. So, of course, I got it (our table also got the bacon brownie, yum). While I'm not much of a dessert person, the bread pudding was delicious. We shared the two desserts between the 5 of us, which was the perfect amount. The Pimm's Cup was just right, and the Boudin Balls were amazing. \n\nWe had made reservations, since it's a pretty small place, but were running late because of work. We called, and they said no problem, so we showed up about 20 minutes after reservation time, but got a seat right away. I can't guarantee this luck with everyone, since I tried to book a couple weeks later for a Friday night and they were all booked up. If you show up and get lucky, it'll be worth the wait. I can't remember the name of our waitress, but she was an absolute sweetheart. Trust me, you will not be disappointed with the food and the atmosphere here. And if you are, then I have my doubts about you. :)",

It was smaller than the pictures on Yelp make it seem but that didn't take away from the experience at all. We went about 430 on a Saturday evening. It wasn't busy at all. The bar was open and there are about 6 tables in the front but they also have a more secluded room in the back with a pool table for private gatherings. When we first walked i. The music was playing \nSo the vibes were nice!  We got a table and the man behind the bar came right over to greet us and get our drink orders. They had a full bar and carried a lot of different beers. We just ordered Corona (no pun intended lol). A young lady then came over and took our orders. We got the chicken Philly egg rolls w/tots  and the fish and chips. The eggs rolls i believe are homemade (not frozen) because she asked if we wanted onions, mushrooms, and jalapeños in them-even gave us a option on which cheese we wanted in them. The fish was crispy and fried to perfection and the fries great too! Overall, this visit was great and they service was also great. The guy even gave us some good places to visit while in the city!

  "text": "My husband and I love craft beer, so Philly Beer Week is one of the best times of the year - when we have time to enjoy it. I actually had the weekend off for once, so we made sure to hit up as many of the events and bars as our livers could handle. BRU Craft & Wurst was celebrating their 1st birthday so we hit them up for a late lunch.\n\nThey had a live band performing (mostly covers), and although they were good performers, DEAR LORD was it loud inside! We asked to be seated as far from them as possible, and it was still incredibly difficult to hear one another. A place that primarily shills beer/alcohol should foster conversation, not lonely consumption. We like the concept of the 'self serve' drafts that charge you per ounce, but for this latest visit we stuck with the bar's draft list. They had some sandwich specials as part of their celebration - we shared the roasted pork and garlic pork sausage with sauerkraut, both of which had pickles and chips. The food was great with our cold brews, both meats super juicy and tender and instantly put us in a summer state of mind. If it wasn't for the loud music, we would've hung out longer and had another drink, but our ears were ringing and we left to enjoy the sunshine.",

  "text": "If you want an experience with impeccable staff, service and good...tululahs garden is the place. After eating there after the Moshulu, I was so upset that I didn't book them. The difference of attention from staff and care was most noticeable and the food was to die for. I Agree with Jackson and the other reviews below about the Moshulu. Food mediocre, staff inattentive and lack the care for guests and definitely not the place if you want your occasion to be special. I can't believe the difference of how we were treated with a special occasion at tululahs garden a week later, vs Moshulu. I told the staff at tulalahs how awful our whole experience at Moshulu was and how I wish I would have booked them instead. I dined at Moshulu years ago for a brunch buffet and was really excited to come back. I made a very special request weeks in advance and although requests aren't guaranteed, staff wasn't prepared with any knowledge of what I asked to be written in the book. Hostess didn't seem knowledgeable about seating logistics. Our table was immediately inside the door to the left facing the parking lot which defeated our initial excitement and choice of booking this establishment, which was really stressed ahead of time for having a water view. I wasn't made aware of a dj on top of the ship so couldn't eat there with grandparents and loud music, Even though I asked lots of questions when booking. Waiter came over and told me it was an \"off day\" for seating rooms and an \"off day\" overall. We decided to remain at table but the rest of our special night was ruined because we chose this special place for the views and atmosphere and to celebrate a very special and meaningful milestone.. If you are seated in the ship on the left as we were, I would opt to spend that kind of money at an excellent restaurant with excellent food and stellar service such as Amada or any Jose Garces restaurant. At no point throughout the evening did any managerial staff stop over or check in or ask how everything was. When we got the bill the 20% gratuity was added to the check so it didn't matter how they treated us. The manager walked by us as we were leaving and didn't say a word, just headed upstairs. No goodnight, no nothing. The lack of care and professionalism made this worse. Plates stacked on table while tea was being served. Crumbs everywhere and nothing reset. I don't care too much about a reset table but in what's listed as fine dining, I was surprised. Worst $550 I have ever spent and we love spending money on great food, service and experiences. It was such a letdown. When I called the next day to speak to a manager, the Owner's daughter was very nice and promised a call back later in the day. I didn't receive a call that day, No call the next day, the day after. I called back a few times as The lack of acknowledgment first at the restaurant and now by phone, really solidified the lack of care that the manager on duty displayed that night. I finally received a phone call exactly 7 days later. Manager was rude, condescending, and placed blame on me and questioned my feelings. He scoffed at my explanation of events and only apologized for how I feel but nothing on the restaurants end. I was frustrated and questioned by someone who didn't show his face once that night but claimed he was there and claimed his staff was beyond excellent. He told me I was a waste of his time. If this was the case, why would I have called and why would I be leaving a review on yelp? I opened a yelp account years ago and I don't remember using it since years ago. The manager really could have made things so much better by being nice, respectful and at least trying to understand. He instead made fun of me, made me feel like everything was my own fault and insulted me. I would have loved to be invited back for a redo in a nicer location on the ship as I originally requested or on s day where it wasn't \"off\" as the server stated but now, not only will we never come back there or any sister locations in the city, we will never recommend  Moshulu or any of their sister places to our friends or any one else. I stand by Jose Garces establishments for their professionalism, food, and service. I have never been treated so poorly by someone who chose his career in the restaurant business in my life. Awful, hurtful and sad. Waste of money.",

  "text": "On a quick weekend trip to Nashville, I almost forgot to visit the Country Music Hall of Fame & Museum! I am so glad that I was able to get in a visit before heading to the airport!  \n\nFirst - it is a gorgeous building, outside and inside the lobby.  It's very well designed, with soaring ceilings and windows in the front, and beautiful wood floors.  There is a sweeping staircase and elevators.  The walls are covered with awards and names of musicians.\n\nNo, wait - for real first off - everyone is really friendly here.  The ladies at the ticket counter, the folks at the coat check (complimentary!) and the young man at the beverage kiosk.  All super nice. \n\nThe place is CLEAN.  The floors - whether stone, cement, wood or carpet - all clean.  Walls and windows - clean.  Sparkling.  They are paying attention to this - there was not a speck of litter anywhere.  The cases around the exhibits were crystal clean - and I didn't see people pushing their fingers up against them and getting them all dirty.\n\nThere are plenty of \"hands on\" kinds of exhibits for listening to music and getting information but so much of the visual part of the museum is composed of clothing.  The place is full of headless mannequins wearing the most amazing array of outfits I never did see in my life.  I have to confess - I love the costume exhibits at the local art museums in San Francisco - and this really made the museum compelling for me.  All the outfits are properly fitted on mannequins which stand at the size/height of the original wearer of the item -- so it gives you a sense of how big and tiny some of these folks were (Loretta Lynn was tinytinytiny!).  \n\nThere were so many great artifacts there, in addition to outfits there were instruments, automobiles and many other things.  I would definitely return and would love to attend a special event there.  My mom was very jealous.",

  "text": "I was lucky enough to go on a private tour on a Saturday afternoon with a few friends. Co-owner Andrew was our guide and he did a fantastic job telling us all about the rum making process and explained everything in an easy-to-understand manner. Roulaison is a small and new rum distilling company and, I'll be honest, I know nothing about liquor production. Everything here is handcrafted and it's all local. All of this was pretty new to me, but I found the tour very interesting and Andrew was extremely nice and was happy to answer questions.\n\nAfter the tour came the tasting and I'm not a liquor drinker, so this got real interesting. I can usually handle liquor if it's mixed with something, so I was thankful for the teeniest little thimble full of samples that we had to try. Some of the rum burned, but that's probably because I \"can't hang\". By the third taste I had to reach for water- I'm such a lightweight. I did, however, really enjoy the rum liqueur that was offered, mainly because it had some sweetness to it. You can actually have them mix you up a cocktail, if that's your thing.\n\nI highly recommend the tour, especially if you like learning about new things and how things are made.",

  "text": "I purchased 3 slices and after eating the first slice and a few bites of the second slice, I noticed a small bug, I picked it up and checked it carefully, I didn't want to overreact without being completely certain. I even showed a couple of people who verified that it was a bug,  and then I found another small bug. So horrified and fighting the urge to throw up, I called the store and told them what I found, I was told to bring it back to the store, which I did. The owner was horribly rude, he tried to convince me that it was oregano, which it clearly wasn't, and me in my stupidity forgot to get a picture. He then proceeded to toss me my money back and banned me from the store, as if I would go back there.Just a horrible experience.\n\nEdited to include the private message the owner sent me\n\nHi this is the owner perfect circle pizza thank you for reviewing me on yelp but couple things!first there was no bug or fly like you were pretending and get some education to tell the deference between bug or fly and Oregano and about my cleanest to the my store I guarantee man my bathroom are clean the you house not ti mention my shop you can come even close to compare to any place in Drexel hill you can even call health department and just mention my place and they will laugh at bc they know about my shop thank you again we just not you place and have good day",

Went in and there were only a couple of other people in the restaurant.  Ordered a large pepperoni and black olive pizza and it was outstanding!  We ordered hummus and pita bread as an appetizer. Outstanding! There is a fully stocked bar. Was definitely worth the walk as the food, drinks and service was incredible. I read other reviews where it was posted that the service was not good. We did not experience that as all food and drinks were brought out from the time of order to our table in about 15 minutes. Drinks and appetizers were brought out within 5 minutes. Give it a try and I can assure you that your experience, and quality of food, will not disappoint.",

  "text": "I am specifically reviewing the bakery at this location. Now, Fry's doesn't exactly come to mind when I think of the bakery I most want to go to, but I wanted one of those birthday cakes with the thin picture wafer. We were having my little boy's birthday party with a Star Wars theme and I ordered a cake with a picture of my son during Padawan training at Disneyland. \nThe party was starting at 2:00, I ordered the cake to be ready at 1:00. I figured the less time we had with the cake, the less damage could be done to it. \nAs it always turns out, my husband was ready way before me. He was just sort of waiting around while I was busy with my hair. So he asked, \"Should I go get the cake?\" What could possibly happen, right? \nHe leaves. I finish getting ready. I make sure I have everything I need. Candles, camera, treat bags, everything has been checked off my list. The kids have been ready for a while. Where is my husband? He calls. \n\nme: (instead of answering \"hello\") where are you? \nhim: I've been trying to call you. I dropped the cake\nme: (total, complete silence) \nhim: hello? \nme: you're kidding, right? \nhim: NO! I dropped the cake. It's windy and I was trying to open the door and blah, blah, blah (I sort of drifted out or passed out for a while)\nme: (quiet again)\nhim: oh, so what, now you're mad? \nme: uh . . . .no . . . . just . . . .well, go buy another one. I mean, what else can we do? (I was in a sort of daze really. I wasn't even mad, just numb)\nhim: OK, I'll call you back\n\nAs it turns out, he went back in with the remains of the first cake. The bakery people saw it and made him a whole new one - exactly the same as the first one-  with the picture and all. AND . . . .  wait for it . . .  wait for it . . . . . for free! Yes, they didn't charge him. Plus, they had it ready for him in about 10 minutes. They are complete life savers. I joked with my husband that the bakery people probably thought he had a super mean wife and felt bad for him. Either way, they saved the party and saved my husband some grief. Too bad nothing can save him from all the \"cake dropping\" snarky comments he's been getting.",

Steven, our waiter, was OUTSTANDING. He was very knowlegable about the menu and make suggestions for dessert. He was completely professional in his delivery of food items and graciously retrieved extra drinks and sauces for us. We'll definitely be bsck next year. Chris, the manager was also very accommodating and gracious. He stopped by our table a few times to make sure our visit was perfect.

  "text": "Tang Bistro's been on my radar ever since it first opened. A lot of Northern Chinese spots seem to have opened up recently (South Silk Road, Blossom Northern China Cuisine and Chinese Crepe). TB specializes in Xi'an cuisine.\n\nWe came on a Tuesday evening and the place was half full. The inside is quite spacious and even has a patio facing out onto 109 Street (after all, it housed Urban Diner). The menu is beautifully done and more upscale than your normal Northern Chinese spot.\n\n- Liang-pi (cold noodles) ($7.50) - crap, I didn't realize that you had the option of getting this non-spicy, mild, medium or intense! Would love to see how \"intense\" it really gets. The cold noodles had a chewy, slippery bite. Comes with the usual bean sprouts, julienne cucumbers and spongy gluten. Good but I prefer Noodle Feast's version.\n- Cucumber salad with garlic sauce ($6.50) - the cucumbers had a satisfyingly crunchy bite. The vinegar/garlic sauce was bright and refreshing. Would get this again.\n- Spicy pig ears ($9.50) - the spicy pig ears had a tasty chili oil sauce. Great texture but the portion was pretty small for the price. CC thought it came in a \"ear shaped\" bowl.\n- Scramble egg & tomato ($10.50) with hand pulled noodles ($2.00) - the hand pulled noodles had a great chewy toothsome bite to them and the egg & tomato sauce worked well with the noodles. The combo felt like you were eating Italian with an Asian spin to it. The egg reminded me some sort of delicious cheese. I know that sounds weird but it was good.\n\nThe dishes are a bit on the oily side of things but everything was solid. Will be back to try more dishes. 3.5 stars.",

They were very clear on prices and what was included and what was needed of me. Prices were very fair. They quoted me at between 3 to 3.5 hours and it only ended up taking 3 hours. The three guys were super friendly, professional, and quite courteous. They helped me disassemble the bed and put it back together. They also asked whenever they had any questions of where things should go in the new house. They were extremely careful with out furniture and our new house. I would definitely hire them again.",

The kids were playing in modern formations and on rocking horses. The doggies were wagging their tails, as they're welcome here, and folks were grabbing drinks from various shops shaped like cargo shipping boxes! Way cool! They included a Tiki bar, Craft Cocktail Concepts by Blume, Urban Village Brewing and more! Think anything from exclusive IPAs on draft to Frose' (frozen rose') and sangria. A lil something for everyone! \n\nAll were enjoying the sunshine and good vibes.\n\nThere's a decent variety of food...Mama Maria's Italian Ice, Urban Empanada Box, Passyunk's own Essen Bakery, Tokai for vegan French Toast and bacon a la cart, Bru, Lil Sum Sum for dim sum and Spread Bagelry. \n\nThere are some shadier areas and pretty textured white umbrellas. There are also really cool modern seating options. \n\nThere are light strands, cut out iron lamp poles and marquee lights on the shops for at night. \n\nThere's also a stage! I can't wait to see who performs! \n\nThere's giant wooden Jenga and a neat viewing platform. \n\nThere's even a toy store with bubbles and chalk to keep your kiddos busy. \n\nIt's definitely a unique space I'm thrilled to see! It's so nice to have a reason to come back to this area again!!\n\nOh, and the friendly looking robot statue named Bebot, who was originally created for Burning Man at the entrance, is so fun! \n\nDog park, large kids' space and nursing areas to come...\n\n*As of Monday June 10th, the parking lot to the left of the entrance will have FREE parking with validation from any of the shops!\n\n**Restroom are air-conditioned trailers in the rear of the park.",

  "text": "I'd like to start my review by acknowledging that Jeny took her time and thoroughly tried to fix what someone else in the salon started. I am very happy with the customer service and patience she gave me. That being said, I will still never return. I walked in without an appointment and asked for a full set of acrylic nails. I was greeted instantly by the owner/manager and sat at station 6. I told the man I wanted long tapered shaped similar to a \"coffin\" but not bowed out at the natural nail line. He seemed to understand what I meant. What first bothered me was that he did not clean my natural nails; did not trim them or push back and cut the cuticles. He used the nail drill to file the tops of my nails which is not a good practice as it makes the natural nail too thin. Then he glued on the nail tips. He did it very quickly and carelessly, so some of them were noticeably crooked but I figured that could be at least somewhat corrected along the way. He asked me how thick I wanted the nails and I explained I wanted them to be thick enough so that they were strong and had a nice curved apex (highest point in the middle of the nail plate). I started noticing how bad they looked while he was filing the sides and they only got worse after shaping and the final filing. Instead of the tapered square look I'd asked for, he did a dramatic coffin shape. I can understand there may have been some confusion due to a language barrier, but every single nail was terribly uneven and the apex on every nail was flat. Not to mention they were much shorter than I wanted. I stopped him and pointed out, explaining very thoroughly, each flaw. He said he did not see any problems with them and his other customers would've been happy with them as they were. I told him I was unhappy with the nail shape and wanted corrected. I spoke with the manager and waited 30 minutes until someone else was available to correct my nails. That's when Jeny did her best to correct the work. I am still really unhappy with the end result but I appreciate her trying to fix someone else's mistakes. The manager and the man who I originally started my nails made me feel like I was just a difficult customer because I was unhappy with the poor work done.",

I was just there two weeks ago. So, as most people point out, the place is classy but expensive....and the portions are a bit on the skimpy side. I like going during happy hour (which I don't think they are having anymore) when the drinks and some appetizers are at a discounted price. Atmosphere is trendy and fresh. My only complaint is the chairs aren't that comfortable to sit on and chat. My girl friend and I split two  appetizers and had some wine. Both appetizers were fresh and tasty. I am not going into details in describing them because I am not sure if they are even still on the menu. I am willing to give this new pizza place a shot, but I really hope they have a happy hour.",

And I will preface this by saying I have been to two other Wasabi's (the one downtown, and the one out in Town and Country) and both of those locations were pretty good. The service at this Wasabi was wonderful, so I am not complaining about service. It was the food. Just terrible. I ordered a lot of nigiri.... amaebi, ikura, maguro, sake, tataki tuna, and uni. I was really excited for the uni too. But it was AWFUL. I seriously cannot believe they would sell this to people. Did the chef even taste it? It was not 'old' or 'sitting out' for too long, just to clarify. It must have been from Maine or maybe the urchins they harvested weren't in season....I don't know what it could have been. But my taste buds do not lie. It was sour, and even bitter. Instead of being soft and smooth in texture, it was almost chewy and it was definitely firm. Blegh. Totally cockblocked as I was prepared to buy a shitton of the stuff. The other things I had were only so-so. The tuna and salmon did not have great flavor. The tuna tataki was the only redeeming piece of sushi on the entire plate. I left still hungry as I sent the uni back. They were understanding about it, but ugh. It was just awful. I am not going to bother to come back to this location if they aren't serious about ordering good quality seafood for their sushi. :(\nOn the bright side, Bob's called me the very next day to tell me they got fresh urchin in-stock. Totally made me rejoice because the uni from Wasabi was just that terrible!",

  "text": "Came her for the first time after I had been wanting to stop by for years on a Wednesday night. The place was PACKED, I think because of the gem show, but we didn't have to wait too long for a table. Unfortunately our table was right next to the front door, and it was a chilly night, so we weren't super comfortable even while wearing our jackets. Some of my review is probably a bit tainted by the fact that they were so busy, but they didn't handle the rush super well. It took awhile for someone to come take our orders, and then awhile for our food to arrive. The food didn't come all at once, but one thing at a time, which was a bit annoying when you're really hungry and just want to start eating. Also, they forgot an item from my order, so I had to wait awhile for it to arrive. I ordered the chicken vindaloo, which I expected to be spicy as vindaloo usually is, but it wasn't very spicy. I didn't find the flavor that great either, personally. Most of the Indian food I've eaten has been in the UK, so my standards may be a bit high, but I wasn't super impressed. I also had a chicken biryani that was ok but not great. Our naan was quite burnt, rendering parts of it inedible. However, the shining star of the meal was the chicken tikka masala - that may have been the best chicken tikka masala I've ever had. While I wasn't thrilled with my dish, I would definitely order the chicken tikka masala again. I also ordered a takeaway order at the same time that I placed my main, and I had to ask multiple people for it and go back to the counter in the back before I got it, after sitting and waiting for what felt like an eternity. If the chicken tikka masala wasn't so good I probably would never go back, but for that alone I would brave the crazy service just to have more",

It's a good restaurant by Burlington County standards, but if you've been outside of the area before and come back for the holidays, you know that this place is so overpriced and doesn't offer anything of quality. First, the decor is so outdated you feel like you've been transported back to a 90s banquet hall inside. The Christmas Eve menu was a mixture of fried food, steamed bag veggies for sides, and pastas in jar-like sauces. Among our dishes, we had the filet (40$ for a steak that wasn't prepared properly either the first or second time and was the size of a baby's fist); chicken francese (supposedly in a white wine sauce, but really just was a creamy/congealed butter sauce). This place is ok for senior citizen groups looking for a slightly-fancier alternative to a diner, but if you're going to pay the price this place charges, why not just go to Philly or NYC for quality food?",

I had to weave my self through a lot of people who were just walking within the first 1/2 mile which really frustrated me.

The lighting is nice for a cozy bar atmosphere, though.\n\nThey have outdoor seating and serve food, but the service is incredibly spotty. Bars shouldn't try to be restaurants if they're not interested in good food and have a way of delivering it to tables. The nachos I tried a couple of months ago were barely passable. I've been spoiled by the Cantina for too long, it would seem.\n\n\"Eehhh.\"",

Sadly, these two soups were almost identical and neither tasted good - they were both very spicy with a burnt flavor. My stepmom's chorizo burrito was not tasty either. She is convinced the meat was actually ground beef. Tacos or nachos seem to be a better bet here.  Also, the music is super loud and it's definitely a festive bar vibe which is cool but not what we were expecting. Again, the service was good and the place was packed. Most of the happy people had margaritas and nachos. It's more of that kind of place.",

The wait to sit down was 10 minutes but we didn't want to wait for that so we sat at the bar which was empty. We waited at least 5 minutes for someone to come over and had to ask to see a menu so we could quickly place an order. I havent been to olive garden in a year and at first glance of the menu I thought the entrees looked a little over priced. To my surprise we also got a choice of soup or salad and we get unlimited breadsticks. The soup and salad is actually a pretty large portion. I ordered lasagna and took my leftovers home. I had a full size meal leftover. \nOverall olive garden was clean, the employees were nice, but in no rush.",

I have not had such a wildly diversified taste in ingredients as I did this salad. Light, tasty, my mouth exploded with flavor.  \n\nHis ribs were rubbed with zingy dry spices.. fall off the bone meaty pork ribs with such good spicy flavor.\n\nHis lamb mixed in with basmati rice.. He did not throw away the lamb drippings but incorporated them to give the rice such deep flavor..\n\nIf you are on the POP Nashville mailing list, watch for this mans name to pop up and grab a ticket.\nThis is the BEST deal in Nashville for excellent food at an excellent price.\nAbsolutely amazing..\nI cannot say enough good things about this man and his cooking AND the wonderful people who run POP Nashville.\n\nThis IS THE JEWEL of Nashville.\nAll I can say is WOW!",

Well, when I picked-up the shirts, they still had stains on them.  I told the same guy who was there when I dropped off the shirts that they were still dirty, he claimed to clean them and did not offer to clean them again.  The shirts are un-acceptable to wear in public.  I will never return to that business and they don't warrant even a 1 star rating on here.

Looking outside the restaurant, first impression is that it looks like a more run down restaurant but I wasn't going to base it just off looks.\n\nThe sushi is sooo good! The fish is super fresh and all were really good. The volcano roll however is a hit or miss since its served hot and wrapped in foil which is what you don't expect when eating sushi. The teriyaki bowl was okay, chicken was pretty bland. But I would definitely recommend the sushi. \n\nSun sushi however is a little on the pricier side so expect to pay more. However the quality of the sushi is well worth it. They were super stingy on the wasabi and ginger. There were 4 of us but only served one mini plate for all of us to share. The waitress was nice enough to bring out a little more but only when we asked.\n\nWe all ordered green tea ice cream for dessert along with Mochi. Can never go wrong with green tea ice cream! They even were sweet enough to sing happy birthday to my friend with a candle on the ice cream which she enjoyed very much! The waiter also offered to take pictures of as well too.\n\nOverall the sushi was great and the service was awesome!",

They had two dining room areas and a courtyard.  We got a seat outside near the fountain but to get there we have to pass through the kitchen which was pretty neat.  I got bitten by mosquitoes 5 times that night but that's the disadvantage of sitting outside.   The service was creepily friendly.  They refilled all non-alcoholic drinks regularly and they had two people serve your entree so they arrive on the table at exactly the same time. \n\nThings we ordered:\nAngry Oysters - Fried oysters on top of a corn chowder.  This is pretty good.  The cajun seasoning overpowered the oysters though. \n\nShrimp stuffed with ham -  This tasted like a buffalo chicken wing.  The pickled onions and okra was amazing with the shrimp and ham.  Probably one of my favorites that night. \n\nSeafood Bisque - There was no seafood in it and a bit salty for my taste. \n\nWild Mushroom Gnocchi - Tons of mushrooms and flavors were good. \n\nSome kind of crusted fish - Really really good.  \n\nThat's all I can remember.",

  "text": "Jacob knows trees. It is so obvious by the way he artistically trims them. He looks at each tree like a friend and makes cuts that are not only healthy for the long term growth of the tree but are also pleasing to the eye. It is rare to find someone with his knowledge and ability who can meet the needs of his customers with a love for his work like Jacob. His work ethic is admirable. He shows up on time, completes the work he says he will complete for that day, and thoroughly cleans up at the end of each day. He worked for a week on our property trimming 6 fan palms, one huge old oak tree, three smaller oaks, and cut a gigantic hedge that was higher than our roof and about to take over one whole side of our house. He also did a beautiful job on our neighbor's Canary Palm.  His prices are competitive with other tree companies (I got 4 bids). Jacob is also respectful of the neighbors asking permission to clean up on their lawns and making sure they were okay with the view from their side. It was a pleasure to work with him and I plan to use him for many more jobs.",

  "text": "Update - CLOSED? - Went on Oct 14, 2017.  Lights out, door locked.  No \"closed\" sign, but no one in the store.  Called them three times on Oct 28, no answer.\n\n-----  (ordered review) -----\n\nMy daughter was attending a middle-school fund raiser at a nearby Applebee's, so my son and I had to find a way to burn an hour of time.  I punched \"bagels\" into Yelp, and Brooklyn Bagels caught my eye.\n\nI grew up in Brooklyn, so the phrase \"Brooklyn Bagels\" has a very specific, almost sacred meaning to me.  Sure, I appreciate the appeal for any bagel restaurant to apply \"Brooklyn\" to their name - it's not legally-defined, and it improves business.\n\nThis place is the real deal.  I don't know exactly what makes bagels from Brooklyn so special, but out of all the bagel restaurants I've been to in Southampton / Willow Grove / Warminster / Hatboro / Horsham / Huntingdon Valley area, only this place nailed it.  The texture and flavor are perfect.  The New York-style menu spans much of the room.  The owner (I presume he was the owner) is friendly, and the sandwiches are excellent.\n\nThe ambiance isn't great, and seating is limited - but from what I recall of similar places in Brooklyn, that too is authentic.  \n\nI strongly recommend Brooklyn Bagels, and as you drive there, make a point of sticking your hand out the car window and flipping off any \"Manhattan Bagel\" franchises you pass on the way.",

First they sat us at a round booth that was really small for 6 people even though they had plenty of open tables. The server was pleasant enough but took a long time to come take our order. Salsa was pretty bland but cheese dip was good. Our food took forever to come out then when it did they didn't bring it all at once. And my sons nachos had sat under the warmer so long they were very soggy. And my daughters steak was super greasy. My taco salad was very good though. Just a mediocre experience and way overpriced compared to the average Mexican restaurant. To top it off the cashier didn't bother getting off his personal phone call to take my money.",

The Shrimp po boy is delicious and the portions are great! \n Although I have noticed that the staff is more concerned about not working/hanging out with each other than actually doing their jobs. \n\nOur last visit there was an absolute nightmare. We were seated but never waited on. After about 15 minutes I got up and went to the girl who sat us and asked who our waitress was. We finally got waited on and received our food. Although I have had the Shrimp Po boy at least 3 times prior, this time it was terrible. I have worked in the food industry for 11 years and could tell specifically that the oil desperately needed to be changed in the fryer. When this isn't done frequently it causes the food to taste burnt. \n\nThey were not very busy and about 5-6 of their employees were all sitting outside next to the bar just chilling while we received terrible service and food. \n\nI've read some of the other reviews and apparently this happens frequently. \n\nIf they could get their staff in order this place would be 4-5 stars.",

I would DREAM about their chocolate chip cookies and had to make my mama get me one whenever we rented a VHS. \n\n-Best Cookies (IMHO): Chocolate Chip, Heath Bar\n\n-MILKSHAKES! Their mint chocolate chip milkshakes are my personal favs. I usually ask them to do half whole, half fat-free milk in order to try and cut the calories. Still delish.\n\n-Careful of the employees! LOL. They're all high-school/college kids who are probably in the midst of their first employment so be patient and watch what they're doing so you can get what you ordered! The upside to this is that they can be very generous with the portions and sometimes dish out the extra milkshake in a side dish if they made too much (no extra charge! Be sure to tip well).\n\n-Try and get there or find out when the cookies are coming out fresh from the oven. I mean, this experience is DIVINE. Hot, melty, scrumptious cookies from Hope's are like none other.\n\n-Now that Hope's is attached to Peace A Pizza which actually used to be seriously good before they went mega-local-chain on us. Haven't even bothered getting a slice here in years but, from what I remembered, they went from amazing to mediocre to borderline bad. Sadville. A slice of White pizza and a milkshake used to be the best combo...\n\nOk. I think I've said my piece! Yay, Yelp!",

We discussed what I had to haul and he gave me a verbal \"guesstimate\". The stuff I had him haul was a HUGE 10ft x 8ft x 3ft old timely entertainment center wall unit. It was BIG and HEAVY. \n\nIn all fairness you can't really give an accurate estimate over the phone when you are a junk hauler...you can only guess. \n\nTobey arranged to come over the next day and called me when he was on his way. He looked at the job and revised his estimate, we agreed on the price and we were good to go. \n\nTobey and his associate moved the goods and away they drove. He not only saved by back, he saved me from borrowing a truck, he saved me a trip to the dump, he saved me from having to ask a friend help me move it, he saved me time.\n\nIf you need anything hauled away by a really nice fellow, give Tobey's Junk Hauling a call...you won't be sorry.",

They don't have the right texture. They are almost crumbly and fall apart as you are eating them. They seem more like bread. It's slightly chaotic inside and can be confusing to order. I would come back for a breakfast sandwich or to try some of their other breakfast selections since they are local.

  "text": "We came to this brewery in downtown St. Pete as a quick pit stop before going climbing at Vertical Ventures and we ended staying for so much longer! We had a Groupon that we bought for only $11 and we got four separate flights for each of us. It was easy to go right up to the bar and instantly work out the details of the Groupon and get rolling with our drinks.\nThe atmosphere at the bar is great. It has an open store front, rather than a door, so it's very light and breezy inside, as well the decor is simple yet very playful and nice, with many table games to play while you're there.\nWe were also able to check in on yelp and get a pint of beer of our choosing for only $4 or so, which was very nice! We took these drinks to the back where they had a classic game set up, Mario Kart on the Nintendo 64! It was very fun sitting down and playing Mario Kart and letting more time pass than we realized.\nThe drink choices covered most of what a person might want while out and they were all hand crafted, mostly local beers, which was awesome. My favorite was the pelican blonde, but the sour beer is definitely worth a try as well. This is definitely a company that promotes the drink local ideology. All in all, the atmosphere was amazing, and so were the drinks and the deals. We ended up spending more time than we realized here because it was a great experience! Definitely recommend stopping by here.",

I have several rentals properties around town ranging from 1940s through the 80s era and the plumbing in these can be a bit of an adventure.  Need a replacement stem? Just take it out, snap a picture, email it to them and I can just about promise you not only will they know what it is on sight, they'll have it for you.  I've even been talked out of buying one of those new stems and given a silicon ring for a buck and shown how to replace it instead - you just don't get that kind of service at the big box shops.  Even for my properties on the east side I plan my routes to end up at Bonnets and Stems when I need something - it's worth it.",

Drinks were up quickly, food order was placed.  Corn appetizers and we both chose to chicken with caramelized onions.   Holy ....the corn was the best I've ever eaten, grilled served with a red sauce and cheese.  I could have made a meal. The chicken arrived it was sweet and tangy too much to finish ...thank god for being able to take home the rest for a \"midnight\" snack.\nNow I'm only here for 10 days and I have a list of many restaurants that I want to check out, but I will make sure that I return to Mais Arepas\nIn closing these photos don't do the food justice.

In my most recent and final stay at this hotel in April I checked in electronically (by passing the desk), took a nap, got up had dinner with my colleagues, returned and went to bed. \nI get up the next morning to take a shower and as I step out (dripping wet) I realize.... there are NO TOWELS in the room. Now I'm wet, upset and have to get ready for my meeting. At this point I'm forced to use two hand towels and the towel like rug I had placed on the floor to dry off. \nI get downstairs(fuming) explain to the desk clerk my quandary, she apologized and ensured me it would be taken care of. I explained to her that I am a paranoid traveler and that I preferred to call the desk when I returned. I did that upon returning and they delivered two towels. \nThe next day I decided not to put out the do not disturb sign. When I returned I saw the bed was re-made everything was in order. I assumed because of my past issues the message had got out and that oversight would be corrected. \nI immediately left the room without checking the bathroom, got back late fell fast asleep. Woke up the next morning get in the shower guess what no towels.",

The front bar area has a cool old fashioned feel.  As you meander into the adjoining rooms, you can tell that they were added on at a later date.  They don't have that same warmth.  The patio all the way to the back is totally different than the front area.  The two walls are made of clear garage doors.  You feel like you're outside without being in the elements.  And there are TV's everywhere.  \n\nFor food, we had the hot wings... perfect.  A gyro plate... flavorful meat, and super soft pita bread.  And a burger... large portion, cooked to order, with a slight char.  On the downsides, both salads that we had were soaked with dressing.  In the future, I'll request mine on the side.  But the dressings themselves were super yummy and tasted like they were made in-house.  \n\nService is ok... The 3 girls we dealt with seemed gruff but got the job done... almost Flo or Rossaneish.  I think one of them could take me in a fight.",

We enjoyed a relaxed brunch with well balanced  & free flowing coffee and a friendly (and cute) server. The eggs florentine was tasty and the perfect size.

Their lattes and cappuccinos are also fantastic. You can get gelato in your latte and that is their signature item! The service is always fantastic and the prices are reasonable. You can get three scoops in a small and their flavor choices are vast. The price is about $5 which is reasonable since they pile the gelato as much as they can. I highly recommend the Mediterranean salted carmel, the amaretto chocolate chip and the amarena cherry. Those three flavors together are a tasty combo. Although the hazelnut, coconut, baileys and wedding cake are also amazing. Too many to name so come here for the best gelato in town and see for yourself.",

We were quickly seated at the most perfect table for two outside, next to the little garden. Both Ted and Katie were nice enough to stop by and chat, even giving us a few peppers from the garden. \n\nI had the Asparagus Pizza, which was delicious. The crust is a bit chewy, in the best way possible. My boyfriend had the Basil Tagliatelle and loved every bite. I recommend the Sgroppino to drink. They are quick to serve, but it would be nice to get a little fresh bread and OO while ya wait or with the pasta, just in case there is left over sauce :)\n\nI loved the artichoke salad from KP and was disappointed to see it was a whopping $14. The pizzas aren't terribly large, but had to enlist some help to finish it. So if you want to share a pizza, you might need a salad or a small plate as well. Katie's isn't easy on the pocket book, but it's great for a treat!",

Drinks were okay as well. Nothing special.\n\nI'm not sure how likely it will be that I return here because I've tasted better Mexican restaurants.

  "text": "Wonderful option for healthier yet tasty pizzas. Their pizzas are like flat bread style and for those who are gluten sensitive, then this is your place.  We had a gluten free pizza, and wanted something different. We had prociutto, fig spread and cheese on our pizza. It was very tasty.  A personal pizza is a good size for two people so that you can save room for their amazing nutella dessert pizza. Their prices are even better when you go on creative loafing and get a gift certificate there. Can you believe our bill came out to 1.50. Yes I swear, it was awesome.\nParking is not the greatest in Downtown Tampa. I really don't like driving around the area, but you will end up paying a small price on the meter.  \nYou can sit outside and enjoy fresh air since the outside is mostly shaded, as well as bring your dog. \nIt was definitely a great afternoon. Would be back again. This is my first try at this location, but I have been to the Westchase location which is even nicer. But they both are as equally tasty.",

  "text": "I recently rented from Alamo while in Tampa, FL from 6-16 through 6-21.  I booked the car through the \"name your own price\" deal on Priceline.   \n\nI arrived to Tampa and went directly to the rental counter, which was in the airport and rather convenient.  There was a short line, but the person at one of the other counters (I believe Thrifty) had no line and was able to start checking me in.  This process was rather easy as well.  The agent gave me instructions to go to the ramp and select a car in the compact section.  \n\nWhen I arrived at the section I had an option of 3/4 vehicles.  I was looking for one with a trunk, so I only had a 1/2 options.  Pick the one that looks newer, and am on my way out when I notice there is no cruise control.  I planned on doing a fair amount of driving, so this was important to me (and something I never considered would be missing).  I parked the car and check all the others---nothing.  So I went back to the counter to see if there are any vehicles that have this option (told them I didn't mind downgrading if needed).  \n\nI was told I would need to upgrade my vehicle 2 categories for $11/day.  This seemed pretty unreasonable to me, so I declined and went back to get another car. Luckily, there was a compact car with cruise control that had magically appeared.  It was a hatchback, but had a trunk cover, so it worked.  Left the lot (relatively easy) and was on my way.  \n\nThe return was actually very pleasant, aside from the difficulty I had finding a gas station (that may have been on me).  The employee checking my car is was nice, quick and thorough.  \n\nOver the course of the rental, my biggest complaint was the car had no power. I was driving alone with one backpack and no additional weight, and the car was constantly struggling.  I had a Hyundai Accent (I don't think I would put that in the compact category, but I may be wrong).\n\nOverall I was disappointed with the fact I was lied to by a manager, in order to try and pressure me into a sale ($11 upgrade), and felt the car was below my expectations.  I chose this path over an offsite agency (fox, economy).  Alamo was twice the price, and the service and car weren't much better.  I say that having 2 fairly good experiences and cars using Fox from Vegas to LAX, and have no experience with them in FL.  Realistically they should get a 2.5 star, but they could do much better.",

  "text": "Not normally one to leave a bad yelp review but I was Very unsatisfied with the customer service at this store. Came in and bought a dress and then went back in the store five minutes later realizing I wanted a different dress. I asked to exchange it and there was a $7 difference. The girl would not refund the $7 even though I had bought the dress 5 minutes before that. I have worked in retail and a small boutique just like that with the same return policy and always returned customers the money if they just bought an item. I even told the girl that I don't live there and would have no use to the $7 store credit and she still wouldn't refund my money. I was never informed of this return policy when buying the dress in the first place. After searching around for something to buy I ended up picking out a piece of jewelry. A sign outside said all jewelry 10% off. When the girl rang me up she didn't even give me the 10% discount...I had to remind her. Such poor customer service and would never advise anyone to shop there.",

  "text": "Damn. This place rocked my world. If you know me, you know I'm obsessed with Chinese food. \n\nIt was busy on a Saturday night, but we only waited 15 minutes for a table for 4. The table ordered: mala chicken, moo shu pork, shrimp with snow peas and mushrooms, and hunan tofu. I only tried the chicken and pork, but both of the other dishes looked amazing, got rave reviews, and the plates were all clean by the end. I could see that the shrimp was cooked to absolute perfection.\n\nNext time I go back (oh, there WILL BE a next time, for sure) it will be really hard not to get the mala chicken again. Menu listed it as very spicy, and while it had a kick it definitely wasn't Han Dynasty spicy. The morsels of chicken were so tender and fried beautifully - there was a very light coating that provided just enough crispness. The sauce was surprisingly complex, with notes of sichuan peppercorn, black vinegar, honey, garlic, and chiles. The portion was quite large but I ended up eating it all. Well, F kept stealing pieces but I guess I did offer to share both dishes we ordered... Next time he's getting his own.\n\nThe moo shu pork was OK, but moo shu isn't really my thing. I will say it's by far the best moo shu I've had on a very short list. Loved the seaweed (?) and glass noodles; it was very fresh-tasting.\n\nHousemade pickles to start and chocolate-dipped fortune cookies with orange wedges at the end. What could be better? Some reviewers have complained about the portion sizes but I thought they were a reasonable size. You're not getting two pounds of food like at a cheap Chinese takeout joint, but the food is infinitely better, fresher, and made with higher quality ingredients. Worth paying a few extra dollars for.\n\nDinner entrees are a bit pricey for typical Chinese food, but on par with what you might see at the local Thai places ($14-$17 per entree). Certainly still affordable by Main Line standards!",

I don't mind if we have a big or difficult order but it was only two meals no special orders except for my drink.  the girl put it in as an Arnald palmer more sweet tea then lemonade heavy ice. It came out with light ice more lemonade than sweet tea. I asked for this to be fixed and sat there for another ten minutes until I got out and ask for it myself and they handed me the same drink.  I will not be going back. There are to many other chic filas in the area to go to one that doesn't know how to serve correctly.",

Greatly inflated prices \n\nYou came out once about our heater during your annual checkup in 2016.

Seemed slightly understaffed when more people started trickling in for lunch but were never rude and reasonably fast. \n\nSpace:\nSeems like it's in an old KFC or some other fast food place? They still have the old drive in window up although I'm still not sure if they're using it or not...small space when the rush starts coming in. About 8-9 seats at the bar max, three 4-6 person tables and around 5-6 extra seats against one of the walls. Was able to grab a table but a group behind us had to wait a while for another. They do treat it like a full service restaurant though, waiter/ess has to seat you so no going to grab a seat yourself. \n\nFood: I had half the fried chicken, she had the chicken po boy, also split spiced tots. Fried chicken was very fresh. Breading is thick, very interesting spicy and sweet flavor which I really liked. They have a couple table sauces which go well with the flavor. She said chicken po boy was great. Spiced tots were unique with great flavor but my mouth was a little overwhelmed by all the chicken. I had a Southern Peach. Drink was well mixed, they don't skimp on the liquor. \n\nWould go back again, might try some fried nugz next time.",

It's so nice to meet a doctor who is not in a hurry to \"put you under the knife\",   I have arthritis in my knees, pretty badly, and they are doing everything they can to buy me time without having to do a knee replacement.  Staff is friendly and kind, and the PA and residents they train here have all been awesome.  I would highly recommend Dr.Bernasek if you are having trouble with your knees.  He's extremely kind, calm, and compassionate,  He also takes the time to talk to you and explain things, sometimes even leaving with a little hug,  And he does not order unnecessary testing\n\nNow, this is a HUGE practice with several locations.  And for some reason always run behind time.  When I saw Dr. Bernasek in December, I waited over 2 hours.  This time I had an appointment with his PA who gives the injections \"so I won't have to wait so long\". Well my appointment was at 11:00am but I was not called in until after 2pm.  That is ridiculous.  The PA was very apologetic about the wait, but I still gave him \"what for\" about it.  How can you get 3 hours behind in the morning?  This is definitely the biggest drawback of this practice.  I  do have to say they did bring around bottles water and packets of peanut butter crackers for us, which was a nice thing, but still did not make up for such a long wait\n\nBut, I have great confidence in my PA and Dr.  They don't rush me when I'm with them and they genuinely seem to care.  When it comes to my health, I want the best, and even with these long waits, I have the best.  \n\nMinus a star for waiting time.",

It is off site and it seems as if they only have one shuttle to pick you up form the airport. After 2 phone calls upon arrival and 35 minutes of waiting at the shuttle pickup area, the driver finally showed with a van that was full of other customers. I then squeezed in and sat on the floor for the 10 minute ride. \nI don't like judging a book by its cover but upon arrival, you 2nd guess your decision right away after seeing the building and the area.  If you don't get mugged by someone on the street or 7 eleven next door, one of the guys \"cleaning\" the cars outside under a makeshift canapoy will do it.  \n\nAnyways, once you get through the painfully slow line inside, the customer service was decent and the guy who checked me in was courteous and took the time to ask how our trip was going. Explained my frustrations with getting to their facility and he understood, did nothing beyond saying he was sorry about it though.\n\nOnce I finally got to the van I had rented and paid an additional $50 for a car seat, the van looked like it had been ridden hard and put away wet! There was not one panel without a dent, scratch or gauge.  This was ironic as the person who checked me in made it very clear that I should take the extra insurance coverage as I would be charged for an minor dents or dings on the vehicle. It wasn't vacuumed and the convicts \"cleaning\" consisted of spraying it off with a garden hose. \n\nSave yourself a headache when renting a vehicle @ TPA and rent form one of the companies on-site at the airport.  Any savings you think you might get form one of these 2nd rate rental car companies is not worth it, TRUST ME.",

  "text": "I visited this restaurant for my birthday on Wednesday with my sister and mother.  When we entered the restaurant, we waited. Although there was no line of customers to be greeted and seated.  The hosts were not at their posts and the employees assisting customers at the cheesecake case did not acknowledge us. When the hosts finally arrived to seat us. They did not welcome us and ushered us to the front of the restaurant and/or bar area.  My family is African American and the reason why I am noting this is that me and my family were greeted with cold and unwelcome stares from the Caucasian employees at the restaurant which is unacceptable behavior.  The Caucasian female initially assigned to our table acted like she did not want to serve us so her co-worker, a person of color, offered to do so.  After we were seated, we ordered lemonades. The rims of the glasses were covered in sugar although we had not ordered margaritas or alcoholic beverages. This could have been very problematic as my sister has diabetes.  I informed the server or waiter that it was my birthday and ordered a cheeseburger with fries.  When the food finally arrived, the bun on my burger was charred. The outside of the burger was burnt and the inside was raw.  The waiter apologized as he had not even bothered to ask me how I wanted my burger cooked i.e. rare, medium, well done.  He took the hamburger back while I hungrily waited for him to reappear.  He eventually returned after my sister and mother were finished with their meals with a burnt burger that was too burnt for consumption.  It felt and tasted like they had just cooked the old burger even longer.  I informed our server about the second burnt burger and he brought the manager who wanted to know if I wanted to give it a third try????  I declined the offer and ordered soft chicken tacos instead.  My sister's meal was gumbo with cheddar sauce???  Anyone familiar with this cuisine knows that it should never be made with cheese.  My experience at this establishment was horrible to say the  least. I have visited this restaurant in the past albeit years ago and the service and food had been excellent. I often referred to cheesecake factory as my favorite restaurant and so I was very disappointed and ashamed that I had recommended that we celebrate here.  Neither me nor my family or any family of color deserves to be treated as described at this chain restaurant.  All they will remember is how badly we were treated and the sub-par quality of the food.  I agree that the cheesecake is now \"so so\" and/or average.  We had wasted so much time at the restaurant that we decided not to proceed with our planned shopping trip and simply returned home.",

I can always count on Ghinis to have the freshest most delicious food that I know is always made with the utmost attention to detail. My favorite is that Caesar salad with blackened chicken. The salad is fresh and the chicken always so tender and flavorful but the dressing is like nothing else!!!! Easily my favorite restaurant in tucson and by far the best brunch spot of all time! You are missing out if you don't try it.",

The only thing I personally do not like is that they serve potatoes instead of traditional hash browns. But really, that's more of a personal preference. \n\nTheir orange juice is not fresh squeezed, like they said it was. But only Jack, my husband, is super picky about fresh squeezed, not-from-concentrate juice. Highly recommended!",

  "text": "Having moved out here from the West Coast and having lived in the Pacific Northwest, my preference for Dungeness crab over teeny tiny blue crabs found here is a cause for sadness since they are so hard to find and can be expensive.\n\nThen I discovered that Marco's occasionally holds $35 AYCE Dungeness crab nights!  Hold your horses, make a reservation and head on over.\n\nFirst, to be honest, the atmosphere is just OK. When we first walked in, it felt like we were walking into a funeral home. It was dark and very dated.\n\nThe $35 dinner included fries and garlic bread. We told the server no fries for us please (more room for the crab!). They forgot and brought over fries anyway. They took them away. I ordered their version of an iced tea. I don't know what they brought over, but it wasn't an iced tea. Then they brought out the garlic bread, which unfortunately tasted stale and had very little flavor.  After a bite or two, we decided to pass on that too.\n\nFinally, the crab!  You can start with a plate with 2 large crabs, cleaned and split into two. You have a choice of Old Bay, garlic or plain. I started with Old Bay for the first found, but it was too salty for me. Next two rounds were plain. All the crab was juicy and meaty and sweet - just what I was looking for.\n\nThey do provide crab crackers, but to get the most meat, I highly recommend bringing your own seafood picks and.... my secret weapon... tiny sharp scissors!  Easier to cut through the legs where the shell is thin and you can get out a perfectly unmolested lump of meat that way.",

After owning several true religion jeans i purchased a pair from this store that bagged out after wearing for just over an hour and it started to lose shape. I called the store and explained the issue and advised that i removed the tags to wear the jeans but needed to return or exchange them due to them bagging out after such a short time. I was advised there is no way to return or exchange jeans once the tag is removed and i was referred to read the return policy on the receipt. I again explained i own several jeans the same size and have not had this issue before . How would i know the jeans would not fit so poorly unless I wore them? $130 is too much to not be able to return of something does not work. Another true religion store accepted the jeans and could not believe it was so stretchy.  They explained there are quality differences in jeans made for outlet locations.",

So it has more items than regular Walmart. \n\nStart with grocery. They have bakery, fresh produce, deli, meat and seafood, frozen section and many more. Price is acceptable. I like the Parmesan chicken wing. This is my favorite in the deli section. I like the cream pop at the frozen section. They do have Ahi tuna grade fillet. It good for seared or sushi. \n\nDaily product includes clothing, sport items, electronic, art and craft, bicycle, jewelry, and more. I like the most is their eye glass center, you can get good pair of glass with lesser price with insurance cover. The pant and shock is my frequent item. \n\nThe pharmacy has the beauty product I need, it also has my daily care product like tooth paste, shampoo and mouthwash. Well. They are definitely very convenient for me.",

Spring rolls were huge, but all lettuce and rice noodles with two half pieces of shrimp and no flavor. Fried pork rice had almost no meat in it. Special pho was a bowl of hot water and dried out weird meatballs.  Server was a nice young lady who was terribly overworked, as the only one in the dining room for dinner on a Friday night with 11 tables of people. They were 'out of all alcohol' 'out of Thai coffee' , out of all banh mi sandwiches, and had no mugs for hot drinks because they hadn't had time to do any dishes.  Really? It was sad. They won't make it if this is how they really operate. Go to sawasdee for much better Thai, or the Vietnamese restaurant in castleton for real pho.",

  "text": "5 stars for Michaya, 2 for the boutique itself. The girls at the front desk are not that inviting when you walk in the shop. They didn't greet me or asked if I needed help with anything. I had to go up there to let her know I had an appointment. They also misinformed me about the \"50% off first fill\" deal when I called to reschedule my 2nd appointment. I understand the policy, but then I expect them to do their research before actually confirming the deal with the client. When I asked about it while I was paying and told them it was confirmed prior to the appointment, they pretty much implied that I was lying because it was Lara who rescheduled me and she \"would never say that\". First of all, money isn't an issue for me so whether I pay the full price or not isn't a big deal. Just maybe next time, learn to acknowledge and apologize for the misinformation then explain the policy without making your clients feel like you are questioning their integrity. \n\nAnyway, booked my first appt with Michaya 2 weeks ago using Groupon. This was my first time ever getting lash extensions so I didn't really know what to expect. I liked how she asked me questions to help me decide what length and style I should go with. We decided to go with natural looking lashes, then she said we can change it up on our follow up appt if I wanted a more dramatic look. The process took an hour and the whole time I was very relaxed. The ambience in the room and her music was very soothing. She told me what to expect when we were done, which is pretty much to expect a lot of shedding. She also told me to book my follow up in 2 weeks. \n\nI had my follow up yesterday and by the time I got to the boutique, I felt like I only had 25% of the extensions left. She said my eyelashes are sparse so the lashes aren't holding on as much as they should be. So this time around, she used a stronger glue and we went for longer, more bolder look.  \n\nIt's been 24 hours since my appt and so far I've only shed 1 eyelash! Compared to the first time, where I lost about 10 on each eye. \n\nSo far so good. I enjoy getting them done with Michaya. She's kind, professional, educated and she really does care about what you want.",

  "text": "Came in here for a late dinner on Friday night. We sat at the bar, feeling like it would offer a spicier ambiance. The bartender was attentive although seemingly wanted to get outta there. After reading some reviews, I was convinced to go with the Lemon Basil Mojito..pitcher. At $34 - you get a large pitcher of this cocktail. \nWe started off with the bacon-wrapped bleu cheese stuffed dates as I have an addiction to a version of these that I make with manchego and prosciutto - my version blows these away....way away. Mojo must deep fry their version as the crispiness of the bacon really turned me off. We also got the edamame curried hummus with some lavash crackers. This was simple but tasted really nice - lacked enough crackers to finish off the hummus. \nWe got a flatbread pizza and a trio of sliders (Korean BBQ, lamb, black bean) for our next course. The flatbread pizza was forgettable and the best slider was the black bean for sure. The Korean BBQ had a really strange tasting slaw that needed some spice and salt. The bread pudding for dessert was the all-star of the meal and almost got Mojo four stars. Mojo offered good tasting food and solid drink, but doesn't warrant the price.",

As for the not so great, the staff at the front desk, the two times I interacted with them, were both pretty surly. A smile & thank you are pretty standard in customer service, I didn't get that either time. The area by the elevator had duct tape covering something on the wall. TACKY! As for our room, the floor in the kitchenette was sticky & there was an odd odor.  The room was scheduled for some light housekeeping while we were out ( which we weren't charged for, apparently it's scheduled every so often :/ ) and we didn't receive new towels and the trash bag was taken but not replaced. I felt like a lot of the staff were just phoning it in. It'd be nice if the place's give-a-damn meter worked because this place could be halfway decent if they tried harder.",

  "text": "This pains me. After a long day of running around, my husband and I just wanted to grab a quick bite before going home. I make it a point to patronize local businesses and we chose Coach's. That was apparently our first mistake and it only got worse. We came in the side door to see a busy bar area; the bartender looked at us, said nothing and went back to her bar customers. Apparently, a server had to be called in, but after 15 minutes of being totally ignored, we were getting ready to walk out. When the new server finally made her way over to us, she was friendly but didn't apologize for the lousy service. She took our drink orders before dashing away again, and came back with them 10 minutes later. At that time, we ordered. I got wings and my husband a patty melt or something along those lines. During the 45 minutes, yes 45, we waited for our food, my husbands beer had been gone to 25 with no offer of refill. When the food arrived, it wasn't worth bothering with. Sloppily thrown together and not at all hot. The wings I got were of very poor quality. Many broken bones, and had an old taste to them. Sauce was flavorless. The blue cheese dressing was good tho. After we had been served, a couple of nice looking guys came in and sat next to us. The bartender (female) who had completely ignored us made a beeline for them. Was so friendly and chatty with them, but never once looked our way. I guess we aren't the \"right\" clientele. I guess Coach's 2 has enough business that they don't need ours, because we won't be back.",

Usually the Crispy Chicken sandwich is a perfectly sized chicken breast although lately I've been receiving a pounded out thin chicken patty instead.  Either the crispy chicken sandwich is getting smaller or there's more of an inconsistency with it.  Wish I would've taken a pic of the 1/8\" pounded out patty with 1/4\" of breading.

There were a few others dining there but the music was very low, which kind of made the vibe uncomfortable.  Our waiter (I think his name was David) hovered way too much for my liking as if we were a nuisance.  I ordered the lamb sliders and mac and cheese.  They were both delicious and cooked to perfection.  Once the bill arrived it was combined for me friend and I.  (why do restaurants assume to female friends who are dining wouldnt be paying separately?)  Anywho, I asked, can you separate the bills.  To which David replied I can do it myself and itemize the bill and list which card was paying for which, this REALLY ticked me off.  So as I sat there trying to separate each of our orders, drinks and taxes he literally stood over my should, not to offer any assistance but to rush me.  We felt like we were intruding just by dining there.  Plus side, is there were great picture ops on the deck.IF I return when visiting Philly again, I'd definitely ask for a different waiter.",

  "text": "What initially was a pleasant experience turned out to be a horrible revealing of a scam!\n\nI am moving out with my girlfriend and this was our first mattress buying experience. We were a little nervous and didn't know what to expect. \n\nOur sales associate was named Joe.\n\nHe was helpful in letting us try different beds and we found one that was \"On sale\". It was a Simmons Recharge mattress. Sensing how green we were, Joe talked us up and threw in a \"free\" basic bed frame and charged an additional $50 for a mattress protector. Not knowing what to expect, we thought we were getting a good deal. BOY WE WERE WRONG!\n\nThe Product:\nThe full sized mattress \"On Sale\" was $950.00 but only worth about $500 online.\nThe mattress protector was $50 but only worth about $20 online.\nThe box spring was given \"free\" but is of poor quality. The center leg is loose and the frame is not sturdy. The weak frame makes noise with the slightest movement on the bed.\nBasic box frame.\nThe delivery charge was $99.00 and was a whole other story in itself.\n\nDelivery:\nThe delivery guys came at the end of a 4 hour window. If we would have known this, we wouldn't have to wait around for half a day wasting our time. \nOnce they came, they didn't show any form of identification. The only reason we assumed they worked for Sleepy's was becuase of the Sleepy's truck. We were reluctant to let them enter our home, however what choice do we have while waiting for our $1,000 bed?!\nWithout saying much, the delivery men promptly setup the mattress, box frame, and bed frame.\nWe asked if we could thoroughly inspect everything before they left. This is an IMPORANT step becuase any little tear or stain will VOID the proclaimed \"worry free warranty\". The delivery men were confused and didn't understand our request. They eventually said \"okay\" but made us feel like we were wasting their time.\n\nThe delivery men also gave us the cheap mattress liner Joe up sold us on. As they delivery men were leaving, my girlfriend promptly puts the liner in the washing machine thinking we were done with the ordeal. 10 minutes later, we get a phone call from the delivery men. They told us they gave us the WRONG mattress liner! We told them we already opened and put it into the washing machine. Their response was \"Why didn't you check before opening it? Can you quickly put it in the dryer? We will be back\". Dumbfounded and insulted by their response, we angrily put it in the dryer. The men came back in 20 minutes but the mattress cover was not yet dry. The delivery men gave us an attitude as if this was OUR fault. We told them to come back in 30 minutes. They had no choice and said \"okay\". We called them in 30 minutes and they told US TO WAIT FOR THEM! We already waited all day for the mattress! What the Hell were these guys thinking?! They insisted they were on the way back however, they didn't arrive for another HOUR! Once they arrived they gave us the mattress liner and put the other one back in the BAG! No apology and no compensation was given for our wasted time. I feel sorry for the next customer who they delivered that too, as the product is no longer NEW. The delivery was a nightmare and THEY COMPLETELY wasted our time.\n\nDisgusted with the experience so far, We went to a local sleepy's were we returned the mattress liner and got our $50.00 back, or so we thought.\n\nJoe gave us a follow up call later that evening. We explained our experience and he stated that he would issue a refund for the delivery. We also told him we returned the mattress liner. As a promise of good faith, Joe said he would send us one for free because he \"wanted us to have one\".\n\nFast forward 1 week, and have have no refund and no mattress liner. We called Joe back and he said the refund was NEVER Processed. We were FURIOUS! We could not understand why it was not immediately refunded when we returned the merchandise at the sleepy's store! Joe had a heated argument with my girlfriend and said \"You are getting upset over $50.00\". We have every right to be upset even if it was over 1 cent! 2 days later, the refunds were processed however, no mattress liner was ever sent. We don't expect Joe to ever send one now.\n\nSleepy's is a rip off company with scam sales associates that treat you like they are selling used cars. The delivery service is completely unprofessional. They DO NOT process returns in a timely manner even when you give them their merchandise back. God forbid we ever have to call them again for warranty concerns or other issues. We will NEVER DO business with them again, and I will make sure everyone and the internet knows not to as well.",

Even though some may see this as not a big deal I see it as a huge deal as they deal with their customers and deliver when they say they will. Great job guys! Great service!!",

Plus they take you home if you dont want to wait it out. \n\nAs for the price in maintenance service, I think it's still a little steep.  Had a valve gasket replaced and a simple diagnostic check (engine light came on) for a whopping $275. Most of that which was cost in labor.  Went home kicking myself knowing I could have done the work at home for a hell of a lot cheaper.  Of course after watching a few YouTube videos for difficulty level. They also recommended a Tune-up for a cost of $363.90.  Ugh no thank you.  Found all my part on Rockauto for $54.00.  Doing this one myself. Oh well, you live and you learn I guess.",

  "text": "It's literally hard to believe how good this place is. The wait for a table will tell you because it's not short, but the hostess manages it with skill.  The service alone is worth five stars and I will tell you why. We encountered a rude bartender who was openly upset, declaring he was aggravated that they were so busy.  He was rude to my sister in law who's birthday we were celebrating.  A problem seems to bring the best out of these people, the manager and the owner were the most engaged and professional we have ever seen. My brother is a chef at a resort (we will not name here) and he was the most impressed in our party.  But on par with the incredible service was the food. Everything our table received was exceptional. The omelettes are perfect. We had one of each between us. The savory breakfast bowl was very impressive, a great combination of ingredients and well executed. We will be back. And we will be sending a lot of people in the meantime, you can count on both.",

  "text": "Warning, I am all over the place with my review of Pub and Kitchen. I have to say we had wonderful service but it was an extremely loud restaurant and at times impossible to communicate with her.  We made a mistake by bringing my mother who is in her mid 70's for dinner.  What was I thinking?! In my defense, the last time I had been to P&K was over an early weekend lunch and it was really quiet. If there is a next time I'll sit in the back room and perhaps leave her at home.  \n     As far as the food my review is mixed. The menu didn't seem to offer enough standard pub fare or traditional dinner plates. Our server was friendly and upbeat and pretty darn quick considering that the restaurant was jam packed this early Saturday evening. Our table shared very creamy yummy deviled eggs. The eggs were fairly standard but didn't last long to really mull over their merits.  I had AMISH CHICKEN with a savoy cabbage roll and butternut squash.  I was really looking forward to it because it was highly recommended on other reviews. Unfortunately this was not a wow dish for me. Our server said that it was a half of a chicken but it just didn't seem to pan out The piece of chicken was underwhelming what. The stuffed cabbage was odd and all in all the plate was one dimensional. The menu for dinner was fairly limited and I wish they had a few more items to choose from Igather that The kitchen must be small. I will say, one of my dinner partners had the cheese and charcuterie platter. That looked  delicious. The onion dip by standard, the waffle chips were addictive! \nSo in conclusion if you're bringing granny out perhaps choose a different spot for dinner.  I personally would recommend sticking to the pub like food... snacks, chicken wings, dips and for sure the  waffle chips! If you are adverse to loud restaurant dinners just go for drinks.",

All staff at vision center were great like Alex and Jason.\n\nCheck out stand staffs were fun to make small talk and very friendly. The store is clean and well maintained. \nFor the price? Well, when most of the items are great price and cheaper than any other place, some are more expensive than Meijer or Walmart. So you do your homework before shopping at COSTCO, but overall 5 star for this COSTCO!",

  "text": "If you like having to argue for some basic amenities at a restaurant, in this case food, then this place is for you. If like the rest of us, you enjoy timely, courteous, judgement free service, take your business elsewhere. \n\n1. We ordered four orders of the feta dip (which to their credit was actually divine) for a group of 14 and were given a total of FIVE tiny pita pockets. When we asked our waitress for more pita, we were told to peel  the pita in half for more. Lady, we know what a godamn pita pocket is. We aren't rationing for a flood or in prison. Bring us more pita. After initial reluctance, the wait staff brought us only TWO more pieces of pita for a table of FOURTEEN. We again requested more so there could be enough for everyone at the table but we were asked why we needed more since we were still ordering entrees. Is there a pita shortage in Nashville that I wasn't aware of? Is there a reason why a \"Yes we can bring you enough but it might charge extra?\" was so hard to do? AND THEN, at the end of our meal when we declined dessert, the waitress responded with \"I figured you were full from all that pita.\" Long story short, if you want to save yourself the investigation by the wait staff about why you would like enough food for everyone, bring your own pita. \n\n2. Service was excruciatingly slow. If you want ketchup with your burger and fries, then too bad because you'll only get it after you've eaten all your food. You also may be asked to provide a PHD caliber defense for why you need extra ketchup. \n\n3. The waitress explained that everything on the menu was meant to be shared. We found this strange considering everything on the brunch menu was mostly sandwiches, but figured we would wait and see. When the chicken biscuit came out in a portion fit for a developing fetus, we really had to wonder if this was a restaurant or a fat camp. \n\n4. We had to put down a deposit of $10 per person for the reservation. The restaurant charged us anyway even though we all arrived on time and when asked to apply this charged portion to the final bill, it took two conversations with the inapprpriate, winking manager to settle the dispute. \n\nBottom line, don't bother coming here unless you want to be volunteered as tribute into the real life hunger games.",

Often times I am disappointed with calamari because it's just fried nothing. This was the complete opposite.\n\nFor my main course I had a special which was an 18 oz. Delmonico cut ribeye. It was life changing. I didn't speak to anyone while eating it because I was savoring it so intensely. \n\nThe service was top notch. I will be back soon.",

  "text": "I picked Fonda Nails today because of all great reviews here. I am happy to say I was not disappointed! I was a walk in and they were able to accommodate me as Fonda has hired a couple of technicians she is training. (I would probably call next time to make sure they can take me) Alex, the nail artist who started my Premier Pedicure, first offered me something to drink and then started my pedicure. He was very thorough with getting my toes cleaned up, scrubbing and massaging. Fonda took over and put on the color and cleaned up a little more. I appreciate that it is her name above the door and she wants to make sure everything is done to her specifications. I LOVE the outcome and the color (Terra Cotta and I think number 425)\nThis salon is extremely clean and has a huge assortment of colors to choose from. I feel they are fairly priced and there is still free parking on that part of Central Ave so that's always a good thing. \nI also enjoyed talking to Danny who was there lending support and customer interaction. :) \nA very enjoyable experience and I will definitely be a repeat customer!",

  "text": "Went here when we were in the area looking for a place I haven't been to.  A good stop it was.  It was a late lunchtime on a weekday so it was empty but that fared well for us because service was a-one.\n\nMany interesting items on the menu you don't normally see.  Surprisingly, there were a house special wings that I have never heard of.  Mambo wings.  Had to have them.  Not glad I did.  I liken them to crack or heroin.  If you never try it, you won't ever crave it.  I am a pushover for wing recipes I haven't had and I never heard of Mambo wings so I had to get them.  Now, I crave them daily.  \n\nWaiter said they got the recipe from D.C.  Now I research them and they have been around a long time there although more often called Mumbo wings.  Mumbo sauce is apparently common in chinese take out joints in D.C. but has a large wing following.  Enough that there are Mumbo wing restaurants.  I have been a wing-head ever since they first came to this area with Hooters, Melons, Mugs N' Jugs and mostly because I lived across the street from Knockers (where the original Winghouse is now).  That was around 1989.  27 years of wings and I have not heard of Mumbo wings.  Damn you to hell 1933 Pub & Grill.\n\nNot sold in Walmart.  Not in Publix.  Not in Winn-Dixie.  I must make the trek to 1933 or suffer the consequences of $15 per bottle on Amazon or Walmart.com.  This may be my last review as I may be broke soon due to the scarcity of Mumbo sauce in this area.",

I feel at peace and so welcome here by the staff and fellow parishioners. I could stare at the ambiance all day. The stained glass windows and the gold trimming details , the marble pillars, I feel like I'm in a huge cathedral. Oh and the musicians and choir are outstanding. \n\nI have to give a special shout out to my Fav Friar, Fr. Zachary Elliott, OFM. He is so wonderful! He worked with me during my confirmation and also with all of the steps I needed to take before getting married. He is extremely kind, caring, and he made the process fun! I received so many praises about him after my wedding ceremony and he even was so kind to attend our reception and deliver our prayer before dinner.",

  "text": "Due to my extensive travel history, I have built a very strong and picky tongue for authenticity. That being said, I can tell you Casablanca is the real damn deal. I'm about to tell you why. \n\nThe entire menu at Casablanca is filled with what you'd find at a typical restaurant in Havana. I recognized many dishes that I've dined on and they were all delicious, so it was hard for me to make a decision. During my first visit I bellied up to the world-famous Sandwich Cubano (roasted pork, ham, pickles, Swiss cheese and mustard on a Cuban style bread). Man, I tell you, it was SPOT ON. Reminded me of my trip years ago when I had my first one. The meat was roasted to perfection, delivered a dynamite of flavor and was too damn good to stop eating! If you try one thing here, this is it!\n\nOn another occasion I was served the Ropa Vieja (shredded beef in Cuban Creole sauce with onions and peppers. Served with white rice, black beans and sweet ripe plantains (maduros)). This also happens to be Cuba's national dish! Again, each bite took me back to Havana. Sweet, delicate and tender beef paired with fresh cooked rice and beans. The taste was outstanding. Boise lacks so many authentic cuisine but Casablanca reminds me that true food is there if you seek it. \n\nOn another note, I absolutely loved our waiter both times. He was very kindhearted and humorous, took time to inform us of what each dish consisted of, which was super helpful for my very Americanized husband (nothing wrong with that - he just doesn't have the palate for authentic food like I do!). \n\nIn a heartbeat, I recommend this to anyone who is tired of over-sweetened, sodium packed eateries that boast but fail to deliver genuine cuisine. Also, if you've never had Cuban food you are missing out on so much!!! And it's here, in little Boise so HEAD OVER AND SUPPORT THIS LOCAL BUSINESS that I love so dearly!",

Dumplings are only sold in groups of 5 unless you head over on Wednesday when they have $1 dumplings. Typically you can not mix Sweet and savory but the counter guy was feeling friendly and allowed me to do so. My friend and I ordered a cheesesteak noodles and a 5 pack of dumplings. Taco, buffalo chicken, cheesesteak, apple pie and cheesecake. There are sauces on the table are great for dipping. As a condiment lover, enjoyed them greatly! The dumplings were packed with flavor. The cheesesteak was my favorite savory And the cheesecake my favorite sweet. Apparently cheese is the key to my happiness! I might have ordered another if they available individually.\n\nThe noodles were fresh. Ramen style but fancier. They were tossed in a white super gooey delicious cheese sauce with large pieces of cheesesteak and perfectly cut scallions. \n\nLooking forward to hearing back to try some more. Hopefully my next trip will be on a Wednesday where you can buy as many or as few as you would like!",

Excellent. The first few bites of the pork were somewhat smokey tasting, but a little dry and I had to keep adding 1 of their 7 sauces. That's the most sauces I have seen anywhere.  They also offer burgers, lots of side choices and desserts.  A nice enough place with plenty of seating and a few tv's.  So 3.5 seems about right.",

We weren't the Cha Cha Slide kind of crew, but we did want people out on the dance floor all night. He created the perfect sound track to get us through all aspects of the night: cocktail hour, dinner, dancing. He was also a great emcee--he kept us on schedule and knew how to keep the party going at the same time. All of our guests commented on how fun the night was. I cannot recommend Chris enough! Thank you, Chris!",

  "text": "I believe I have finally found my coffee shop! Cue the heavenly light and angels...AWWWWWWWWE!\n\nOff the bat, it smells amazing. Not that coffee shops don't smell okay, the slight hint of tea leaves in the air is so refreshing here.\n\nThey still have everything I love from the other Mojos including the nifty chalkboard, local art, but more of it, including the postcards and flyers lining a step right under the bar. I called for a Milky Way and forgot to request it cold. Nonetheless, it was DELICIOUS and beautiful to boot. \n\nThough there are no couches for that homey sort of feel, I love all the tables because 1. They're big enough for all my shenanigans I bring to the coffee shop. \n2. There is no lack of plugs. \n3. They're spread out enough that everyone's biz is their own.\n4. This is a weird one. I love seeing people I know, but sometimes it can be distracting when trying to knock something out. There are enough tables that you don't have to be by the front door where you'd constantly be looking up when someone comes in and possibly seeing someone you know with the obligation to chat. And there is a back door that you can escape out of. \n\nMy only problem is the chairs are a little tough on my boney butt, but I think that's a personal problem. Next time I'll just bring one of those blow up cushions, and be the cool kid. Will definitely be returning!!!",

  "text": "When you've had to much fun Saturday night, there's nothing better than brunch! Even if you're not feeling the effects of your previous night, brunch is never a bad idea! Now you could do the fancy brunch buffets, or pick the perfect patio to while away the day, or you could get right down to business and cure what ails ya with some serious food, like the brunch slice at Noble Pie! \n\nThis piece of pizza is nothing to muck with! They top a large slice with their creamy and garlicky bianco Base, a light layer of mozz, prosciutto, sun-dried tomato, asparagus, and red onion, and then top it with spicy hollandaise and... wait for it... a FARM FRESH EGG! As soon as it arrives you've gotta slather that ooey gooey egg yolk all over the slice and enjoy. The flavor combo is dy-no-mite and it's the perfect piece to put that hangover out to pasture! \n\nOn top of that beauty, Noble also rocks a full brunch menu with calzomelettes, sourdough toasts with eggs, cheese, and fresh veggies, a BYO Blood Mary and Bottomless Mimosas, and a full cocktail menu, all served up in a chillaxed atmosphere! Oh yeah, they also have gluten free crust and are happy to accommodate any special requests you might have.\n\nNoble is an awesome addition to downtown Reno and a stop worth making for brunch, lunch or dinner. See you there!",

Just because I rent a car for over 24 hours, doesn't mean I'm actually going to go over the mileage limit! How can they just ASSUME these things? Very unfair.. And after they charge you for the milage that you NEVER drove, it's a pain in the butt to have to call them to get your money refunded. \n\n#2 - Gas cards being taken out of the cars..Which means you have to pay out of pocket for gas! Isn't the whole purpose of opting for this program to save money and NOT have to pay for gas? Why don't they issue personal gas cards to all of their members, that pull from the same gas account?\n\n#3 - Smarmy e-mails telling me that it's not recommended to rent a car for weekend trips, and that it's not really \"car sharing\"..and now I have to pay more. WTF!!! That email is what really put me over the edge! I don't NEED a damn car to buy groceries or things for the house..that's what SHIPPING is for..I just use the cars to leave the city every once in the while.. is that soo bad??\n\nI am now a proud ZipCar member and happy that I made the shift!  :)\n\n#",

We weren't halfway through our appetizers of lettuce wraps and two crab wontons when our food was served. We had the Honey Crispy Chicken with white rice and the Pei Wei Spicy Chicken. We loved the lettuce wraps. The rest was good but nothing special.\n\nDon't let the word \"diner\" fool you. Good food but pricey.

You'll order bottles of wine from the front cash register (you can use plastic) but when you order your small plates be sure to have plenty of cash. The inconvenience is worth it as the food was terrific.  Tatiana raved about the bacon wrapped dates, but I loved the shaved brussel sprout salad over the smoked potato and the drum fish ceviche.  Don't even think about passing up the olive oil drizzled chocolate bark; this desert delighted me so much that I stole into the kitchen to kidnap chef Joaquin Rodas for an introduction to my posse.

Everything is made fresh so almost any dietary restriction can be honored (as I overheard a waiter say).\n\nThe small bread balls were hot and fresh, through the escargot with cream and mushrooms and the fresh salad with beet and pickle chunks next to a sublime pork belly as an appetizer.  Everything on each plate was cooked to perfection in texture and flavor.\n\nIt will definitely be a special place to go versus a regular hangout.

Given a poor performance at R'evolution the night before, and this was only lunch I was not expecting much. Thankfully, Emeril's surpassed my expectations and merits a repeat visit on future visits to NO. We were a party of 11 celebrating my niece's college graduation and we were given a private room. \nA three member staff were very attentive to our every need. Water, iced tea and soda glasses were constantly replenished. Any shared dishes were split by the kitchen staff and given equal attention to presentation. Seemed like the entire wait staff organized to bring in the entrees to the table at the same time. Nice touch.\nThe food was delicious. Crispy calamari and barbecued shrimp were delicious. Chicken and sausage gumbo had great flavor and the spice level was just right. I wasn't very adventurous with my double creole burger and fries, but it came out cooked to order and was a delicious burger. Everyone else was equally pleased with their entrees. The group compares all banana cream pie to the matriarch's version and they devoured the Emeril's version. And the peanut butter pie was just as good.\nWe had a great meal for a fair price. The city has a ton of great dining and Emeril's earned itself a stay at the top.",

They forgot to bring us silverware and ketchup, but other than that it was great.\nPrice: Prices were higher than they should be for this type of restaurant.\n\nWhat we had:\nNachos - delicious. Piled high with lots of cheese. Included guacamole.\nOnion rings - loved. Though for $10 it didn't come with many.\nKid's grilled cheese - good. Especially the fries. \nPesto Pizza - very good.\nChicken Pot Pie - very large and very good! Wished it would have included more veggies in it.",

I sat at the bar. They do not play traditional Mexican music, but rather they played Sheryl Crow, Tracey Chapman and my favorite THE SPICE GIRLS!!! \nAnyway the food was pretty good. I ordered the chicken enchiladas. Usually I do not like the beans and rice but they were really good here, as well as the enchiladas. They do not serve chips and salsa for free. I ordered a modelo de negro and a house margarita after that. I got more buzz from the beer. \nI'd return here. Especially for happy hour with 1/2 off tacos, M-F 3-7pm.",

  "text": "The first Fresh Market in Philadelphia has opened this week in Chestnut Hill.  It seems like most of Chestnut Hill has stopped in to take a look and of course do some food shopping....especially after the blizzard on the weekend.  Like the other Fresh Markets I have been in, this is an extremely attractive store. The food exhibits are very well done....everything looks so fresh and new.  The store is on the smallish side for a supermarket these days but it is of course much larger than a specialty food shop.  Right now there are a lot of tasting stations throughout the store.  I don't think most of these will continue after the grand opening weeks ... but they do add a friendly touch.  There is one big drawback here and that is the prices.  They are def very high.  Maybe these prices will fit in perfectly with many shoppers from well-heeled Chestnut Hill ... but I can't see a lot of other people using this market for more than the occasional specialty item and continuing to do their regular grocery shopping elsewhere.",

Two of our party left most of it in their bowls.  One of our party kept casually listing all the pho places she knows that are better, not intentionally slandering this place, but saying what she preferred about other places, which turned out to be everything...\n\nExcept the egg rolls, which she liked a lot.\n\nThe Thai tea was good. \n\nBest about the experience was the service. All of the girls working there were great, kind and helpful.\n\nI'm not going to have the pho again, but will likely come back to try the banh mi.",

However I'm only giving it 4 stars because I'm not pleased with some of the changes the new owners have made. The potstickers no longer come with sause and the mochi ice cream is now covered in chocolate sause which is quite unpleasant in my opinion. I miss the little salad bar as I use to grab a bowl of edamame beans to snack on while I waited for my first order. Now they do still have the beans but they serve them warm which is gross. They no longer carry everything to make Sherly temples my favorite drink of all time which is quite upsetting. But overall I love the staff and the food. This place has the best redsnapper I've ever had outside of Japan which is saying something. The sushi chefs are always friendly and attentive and really know their stuff. Over all if not for the changes the new management made it would have gotten 5 stars.",

  "text": "Nice enough, this very clean and newly-updated* old place was priced right. Maybe too right. Hint: stay downstairs in the old carriage house if you want to relive that college experience of when the upstairs booze hounds return to traipse around every square foot of their spacious, thin-floored apartment at 3 a.m. Then again this is NOLA. Sleep is a commodity. You get what you invest in. Weekdays, a downstairs room is okay. Weekends, be upstairs only, and try to be considerate of others. If this hotel could control it's guests, I suppose it'd receive a better review. But since it can't control others' behavior, more of a buffer (insulation) between floors during their remodel would have been nice. This is more an indictment against the 20-something generation, I suppose. But Lamothe House is in the guest services business. Perhaps some signs in the rooms to control unruly guests? Right. 3-1/2 stars, on the positive side. \n\n* modern room and decor, very nice...over an old, charming skeleton...leaves one wanting, sometimes.",

When we asked, we kept getting a rundown of what they had rather than explaining how the pricing/ordering worked. We hardly saw our server. I still wanted to give it another shot since I enjoyed the food.\n\nSecond experience was way better! Food was just as good, if not, better. We had a fantastic waitress, Shelly. She was incredibly attentive and provided excellent service. We will absolutely be back! \n\nBlack pepper beef is my favorite so far especially in the udon noodle dish. I also tried orange chicken, which was pretty good. My husband ordered the kung pao chicken, which he claimed wasn't spicy enough. It was perfectly spicy in my opinion. To each his own.\n\nDim sum is the best I've had in Tampa. Honey BBQ pork buns are pretty tasty. My favorite off the carts is the egg tart.

Instead said they'd call when it came in. They never called once, instead I had to call monthly just to be told it still wasn't in. They continued to say they'd call with updates, never did. Called them yesterday to find out the windshield came in a month earlier. Never apologized for not calling. Then said the price they quoted several months earlier has changed and was now over $100 more , couldn't give good explanation why.  The girl answering the phone could not have been ruder or less apologetic.  Needless to say found another local place (clear vision glass) that was cheaper and came to my house that day and did a great job. Wish I discovered them 6 months earlier.",

My brother and I always talk about this special memory with my father and how good the food was. The other memory I have with this place is when me and my fiancé first started dating we took a trip to Tucson to do some hiking and sightseeing and had a great time and enjoyed everything Tucson had to offer especially this place. We love the lights in the gardens and the food was great. I would never called this place the best Italian food I've ever had but it was excellent because the food was savory and the ambience is relaxing and the customer service was superb. My fiancé left her purse there after hours and they were kind enough to open up well over two hours after we left the restaurant just so she can get her purse and everything was perfect. I would highly recommend this place plus it's close to college so the area is pretty cool.

The soups remind me of something your grandmother would have made when you were visiting, fabulous. On to the entrees, where you can have your fill of many different cultures. There are American, Mexican, Chinese, Mongolian etc... Seafood options are endless as well. Shrimp, Crab, Oysters, Fish (baked and/or fried) Prime rib that will send you on your merry way to heaven. It is tender and flavorful. On to the dessert: Cookies, cakes, ice cream, pie, cookie bars, donuts etc... I have to say my favorites are all of it. However they do have this coconut raspberry cookie bar that I have to have everytime I visit. Oh and the chocolate layer cake, blueberry pie. So I guess I really love dessert or they are just amazing at what they do. Needless to say, it is all fabulous, and I can't wait for my next adventure into food there.",

I had several companies give me quotes and these guys came in on budget, while everyone else quoted me about 20K over my budget. The design they created is unique and now that it is done looks amazing. Love the infinity edge. Their detail to quality is superb and their workmanship outstanding. Now the pool is complete they are doing a great job keeping it clean with weekly service.  This is my third pool I have had built over the past 12 years and the best experience I have had.",

  "text": "Eddie is exactly the type of guy I imagine my great-great-grandfather would have enlisted for help after his stopwatch died. He reads as very trusting and family oriented, and a true Tucson native.\n\nExactly the type of person who consistently earns my business.\n\nI had never heard about his establishment before stopping in. I found that he had a listing on Yelp... but he didn't have any reviews or photos or tips. Steep risk, I thought, but there was absolutely no way I was going to set foot in a mall or visit a big-name jeweler. \n\nI'm glad I took the chance.\n\nEddie has a very small, nondescript and antique-y type of shop. He offers watch and jewelry repair, and works with gold, silver, etc. He also does custom work. He will also resize rings and remount. Inspection and cleaning services are free here.\n\nI am not certain how long he has been at this particular location, which is at the very back of what looks like apartments converted into small businesses. Protip: Do not park in that tiny lot off of Broadway Boulevard. Go to the back and you will find ample parking. \n\n\nApparently, Eddie has been in the business for more than three decades. He was born and raised here, and also trained in his craft in Tucson by his father! Pretty cool. And there were a couple of things in there that I imagined hadn't been touched or moved since they had been placed.\n\nI arrived with my Citizen watch, one that I've had for 10 years. This watch is very dear and quite special to me. Of all of my possessions, it is among my most protected, actually because it was such a special gift.\n\nI had to leave it with Eddie because it has a highly specialized battery, which he had to track down. Turns out he ended up having it shipped directly from Japan. He and I had never met, and I didn't want to leave the watch. \n\nBut I could tell from his eyes and energy that I could trust him. It was automatic. I rarely feel this way about a person on a first meeting, so I left the watch behind.\n\nThe watch was ready after a week. Took a bit longer than expected, but Eddie was very communicative, sending me text messages along the way to let me know about the progress. I appreciated that. He even buttered me up a couple of days before I picked up the watch, telling me that it was ready and \"beautiful.\"\n\nI was shocked when I saw it! It looks almost brand new! It felt like I was receiving it for the first time again. Except for a couple of deep scratches it's endured over it's decade, the watch is pristine. He also cleaned the interior and exterior and replaced the faceplate, or crystal, which gives the impression that the watch is nearly right off the factory line.\n\nIf I had a mound of broken watches and jewelry, I would take the entire lot to Eddie. \n\nHe's earned my trust.",

I was able to mix two different teas together.

  "text": "I have to agree with my fellow yelpers, this is a great place for brunch. Classic diner fare with a southwest twist.  We had Jonathan's famous fiery scrambler with homemade sausage and gravy on the biscuits along the new mexican breakfast burrito.  The sausage had a good flavor but was cooked into a hockey puck, so if you get it (and I do recommend you do) maybe get it in one of their dishes instead of on the side.  The fiery scramble has great flavor and I highly recommend it.  The potatoes were deep fried which is not the way I prefer my breakfast potatoes cooked, so they were just alright.  The burrito is huge, so plan for left overs.  You can add the optional green chili on top; we didn't and regret that decision.  Will have to come back and try it again.  The place is crowded, so plan for it.  The bus outside offers a place to grab drinks while you wait, so that is a plus.  Will definitely have to give it another try.  So many good things on the menu.",

We found Northeast on Yelp after getting an estimate on our brakes from a local repair shop that we thought was overly expensive.  The local shop (only 2 miles from our home) gave us an estimate of over $1300 to replace both the front and rear brake pads and rotors on our van (or $1000 for just the rear).  That shop also told us we needed new calipers and hoses.\n\nWe contacted Northeast within a few hours of getting that estimate.  Brian told us that he could do front and rear brake pads and rotors for \"less than $900\".  We took our van to Northeast the next day.  Brian called us in a timely manner and told us that we did not need new calipers and that our final bill (for front and rear brake pads and rotors) would be under $600...\n\nBrian is awesome to work with...very friendly, very knowledgeable, very experienced...\n\nWe got the work we needed done on our van for less than half what the \"other shop\" wanted to charge us!

  "text": "Went here for late lunch prior to a movie. Looking at seafood, which a friend had suggested, but salad bar looked so good we decided to go lighter. We did opt for the shrimp fondue appetizer which was excellent but a bit greasy.\n\nSalad bar was fantastic with many options. Lettuce, spinach, beets, onions, carrots, peas & wasabi peas, garbanzos, cucumber slices, zucchini slices (!), grape tomatoes, sliced mushrooms and more. Even pickled artichokes! Rarely see that. Plus potato salad, broccoli salad, carrot salad, pasta salad and apple salad. And peaches, grapes and cottage cheese, plus more.\n\nAnd for another pleasant surprise, my Raspberry iced tea was delicious! When I was finishing my first glass I found crushed raspberries in it. Who does that? Great!",

They have a wide variety of options - cuisine from the North and South of India. The restaurant can get a little busy during lunch hours, but that is a good sign that the food is great and tasty. I recommend this location to anyone wanting to try great Indian cuisine in the greater Nashville area.",

  "text": "After reading all of the positive reviews, a friend and I decided to give it a try. It wasn't bad but the other reviews made it sound awesome so we were disappointed more than anything else. \n\nIt's a very small place but service is spotty. Our entrees arrived about 5 minutes apart. The veggie platter was very disappointing: the falafel was dry (overcooked and burnt on one side) plus they only give you three and a tiny bit of sauce on top. The hummus was bland and the salad was nondescript (and they didn't give you the option of getting something other than the garden salad; my friend would have gladly paid extra to get the tabbouleh salad instead). \n\nI had the beef kabob platter. There was nothing very kabob-like about this as it was more of a long, thin meatloaf that, like the hummus, lacked any spice. The platter had a choice of rice OR pita. Given that the platter is served with hummus, BOTH would have been a reasonable thing to include especially since it was $10. I'm pretty sure tossing in a piece of pita bread wouldn't have put them out of business. \n\nThe restaurant was quite busy so obviously people enjoyed the food but we found it to be overpriced and bland. It wasn't bad but I expected something better than the Olive Garden of Middle Eastern cuisine.",

  "text": "My beau used to live NOLA and I've visited once before. We both like a good oyster po'boy. Patrick's isn't too far from home, so we made a trip over for a late lunch. We each ordered an Oyster Po'Boy: beau got a large with a side of chips and I got a half with étouffée. Be warned, the full sandwich is HUGE. My husband ordered it with the intention of taking the other half home. \n\nThe Po'Boy is one of the best I've had in awhile. The oysters are fresh, had a great flavor, and were crispy. The seasoning has a good kick, but not too much (I'm a wuss when it comes to spicy foods). Beau loves spicy food, so he added some hot sauce to his. The bread, which really makes the po'boy sandwich unique, is crusty on the outside, soft on the inside, just like it's supposed to be. \n\nThe chips are thick-cut but super crunchy with some heavy seasoning on them. The seasoning isn't hot--kinda garlicky with paprika, maybe. \n\nThe étouffée is thick and flavorful--a crawfish gravy over fluffy rice. \n\nService was pretty good. Ordering the food at the counter was easy. For lunch, there's no silverware, napkins, salt + pepper, etc. on the table, so you have to get it yourself or have someone bring it to you with your food. Once you order at the counter, you are given your drink (soda, tea, beer, or wine), and sit at a table. The food is brought out to you. \n\nWe will definitely try this place again. Maybe for dinner next time. Now we gotta get some bread pudding to go. ;-)",

  "text": "I've been coming here to get Dr. Grossman facials and eyelash tints for years! My skin and eyes are very sensitive, so usually after a peel or a tint, I'm all pink and gross. However, whatever they're using here is super mild but effective! Lashes always looked lovely without pink eyes and there is no irritation on my sensitive skin after a peel. Now that I moved away I still come here when I'm in town. \n\nThe space is phenomenally beautiful and the owner is always there being adorable and helpful and super welcoming/friendly. She proud of her salon and her leadership shines through in her personnel and space. I could hang in here for hours - and I have! Once I was just chilling sipping on champagne (they'll hook you up it's great) and they offered me a pedicure (not free but they were like \"Want to get your toes done?\"). Oh baby! They pedicure spot is so cute and they did a great job. \n\nNow, I was here last week and needed a New Year's Eve bikini wax. I went with Cydney who is sweet, hilarious, smart, and on that cool girl stuff. I've had so many bikini waxes in my life I can't tell you how hair even grows there still. This was the best. The hard wax they use is thin and the ripping-your-hair-out part was PAINLESS, painless honey! Well if you're new to waxing you might hurt but I was like, \"Hmmm usually painless means not working,\" but I haven't had a single ingrown hair or red spot, and my bikini looked fresh that night (or so I was told, if you know what I mean-what I'm saying is I got laid people!). She also waxed my legs - painless. \n\nSupport local CBD business! Support women who are business owners and independent money makers! Support Cydney she's amazing, especially if you need a wax. You'll love Buff's prices, people, parking options (some meters but some free spots around), and the space itself. \n\nTake it from me, folks: I spent a lot of time and money in salons (yes I'm broke whatever) and this is my favorite in New Orleans and THE WORLD!\n\nI recommend an appt on the weekend/in the evening so CBD parking is easier.",

For dinner, I once just had a cup of their vegetarian chili which was amazing! Definitely will get a Bowl the next time. However, I was not so thrilled about their salmon burger. It was mashed up salmon with other ingredients. I thought it was going to be a piece of grilled salmon in a bun. Whatever was mixed with the salmon and the sauce that was drizzled on top of the patty did not go well together. The salmon burger lacked some flavor.\n\nI'll have to find something else on their menu for a dinner option.",

  "text": "**movie trailer guy voice** In a world filled with fast food and bad pizza joints...\n\nThis place is quite literally a breath of fresh air. It's the only place where a quick, inexpensive meal that's made with real food can be purchased as far as the eye can see. Think of it as a fast casual version of Mongolian BBQ.  Pick a starch, a meat, veggies, a sauce and they grill it up for customers. \n\nThe interior setup is awkward with customers having to cut the line in order to fill their cups with ice and tea, which are positioned opposite each other. Besides that though, I'm a fan. \n\nI ordered the subtlety spicy finadene chicken with brown rice, broccoli and mushrooms and left not even a grain of rice in the bowl. I finished it off with a piece of crazy good carrot cake, and washed it all down with some u sweetened tea. With the tip, it cost me about $15.",

I can go pickup a large 2 topping for under $9 tax and all, there's not any other pizza places around town where you can do that. I haven't tried any of their other food as I'm perfectly content with pizza. They've got one of the best marinara sauces I've ever had and their mozzarella cheese sticks are mouth watering.\nIf you haven't caught on yet, I'm a big fan of this place. I highly suggest you go try it out if your around town. You can do take-out/delivery/or dine in. They have a good size dining room with servers who tend to you. If you go on a weekend sometimes they have a live band or singer on the stage. That's right,  they have a small stage as well. Good times. Go. Try. Enjoy.  -TnT-",

How is it possible that the food can be even more delicious every time? I don't know, but Khmer Kitchen makes it happen. My sister and I got the fried calamari again, the weekend special which was a coconut curry soup situation, the lemongrass beef stir fry made extra spicy, and the caramelized pork. Sigh. Just wonderful. This time the lemongrass beef was tender and delicious! And wow...they weren't joking about the spice. We might have to go down a few spice levels next time. Basically everything I wrote before about the dishes we'd already had rang true this time as well. The surprise was in the weekend special. Wow...it was everything we didn't even realize we needed. The flavors were complex, warming, with a hint of sweetness and spice. I loved the giant, soft chunks of potato and carrot. My goodness, it was delicious. \n\nI love this place. I will take everyone I care about here, and you should too. \n\nOh yeah, our waiter is always awesome! Really attentive and doesn't mind that we ask for a million bowls of rice :)",

  "text": "I had been here a year or two ago and enjoyed the atmosphere and my services, and decided to try Glossy 130 out again a few weeks ago when back in the area. Sadly, it didn't live up to my previous visit, and I won't be returning. \n\nThe Good: \n\nEasy to make an appointment. Guy at the counter (the owner? Not sure.) was very friendly and welcoming. Good polish selection. Nice touch with offering a drink during service. \n\nThe Bad: \n\nBad ventilation; smelled like chemicals - you know, that \"bad nail salon\" overwhelming smell. My tech seemed miserable - barely spoke, in monotone, and was extremely rough. Started with a pedicure, and she cut me accidentally on the first toe. Seemed rushed and inattentive. \"Massage\" of feet / legs with pedicure was actually painful - in a \"I feel your nails digging into my skin\" way, not a \"you're working out knots\" way. My pedicure took 10 mins less time than the person who started the same level of pedicure right next to me at the same time, logically because my tech was clearly rushing - I was ok with that, though, as I just wanted the grumpy , rushed service over so I could move on to the manicure I'd also scheduled. \n\nIf only it were that simple, though. Nail tech didn't give me any (I have no ide what they're called, so let's call them...) toe-separator-thingees, then had me follow her (walking fast) to a manicure table. Well, in my attempt to follow her quickly, my second toe swiped my big toe, and since the polish was crazy thick and wet, the polish squished away from about 1/5 of that toenail. The guy from up front (owner?) happened to notice and told the tech to fix it; she leaned down to do it under the manicure table where she either thought I couldn't see or just didn't care if I saw her remove the polish and do only one single coat of color to replace it - no base, no second coat, no top coat.\n\nThen we moved on to the manicure - no option for me to select shape; tech started clipping without asking / before I realized to say something. She grabbed the wrong gel color when I selected one from a set of nail examples, though thankfully I caught that. Randomly and with no explanation my tech then left and had someone else take the reigns, who moved me to a new station. New tech was significantly friendlier, so while the switch was surprising and not explained, that worked out better in the long run. \n\nOverall: this felt more like a cliche mall establishment, with the smell, rushed feeling, lack of attention to detail, and seemingly unhappy staff. Maybe it was just an off day for one tech, but I'm turned off enough that I'm not going to try it again to find out.",

The food was decent, but too many flavors made the taste overwhelming. Fries are good, but you will pay 2 bucks for each small jar of ketchup. So pay attention. I've eaten gluten free for 3 1/2 years and these were prob the worst buns. Super dry! Interesting experience with hipster vibe, but I'll prob never come back.",

  "text": "Crazy Sushi is a popular sushi joint located conveniently near the shops of Chestnut St. I have read many reviews of both Crazy Sushi and Vic Sushi (see review) so I decided to try them both.\n\nFrom the outside, Crazy Sushi looks like a typical sushi hole-in-the-wall. When you enter, it quickly turns a bit fancier. Dim lighting, nice tables, clean bathroom - a solid looking restaurant. I dined in at around 5:00 PM on a Sunday and was the only guest. But, onto the food.\n\nI ordered a spicy tuna crunch roll, a mango/avocado roll, and an order of tamago sashimi. The food came out quickly and the waiter was friendly and polite. The presentation was also beautiful. They served my sashimi on a mountain of ice with the rolls to the side. However, I was rather disappointed with the food, especially after reading the reviews. The spicy tuna roll was incredibly dry. It seemed like it was 85% crunchy, and 15% tuna. The avocado/mango roll was actually very good, but not worth $7. The tamago was just okay, would not order it again from here. \n\nAlthough the menu had a plethora of choices, ranging from sushi appetizers (one I recall was spicy tuna wrapped in seabass) to a two page special roll list, the sushi fell short and I do not think I will be returning. These reviews are a bit Crazy.",

I was in and out in an hour when taking a lunch break for work, even! \n\nWhen Nada found out about my lengthy wait times during my first visit they were extremely generous and provided me with a gift card to come back and try them out again.

Although it was wonderful that a shuttle is provided to take you within a 3 mile radius, we almost always waited over a half hour and sometimes up to an hour for the shuttle. When we would call we were often given a 25 minute wait time and after 45 minutes of waiting we'd call again and they'd say another 20 minutes. We often ubered it as a result so the amenity of a free shuttle was a moot point. Also, apparently at a certain hour they give complimentary wine tasting. We were never told about that so we never had the opportunity to enjoy that. We happened upon it one day coming off of the elevator. And don't drink the $7 bottle of water in your room, they give you free bottles of water if you ask at the front desk.  Overall we had a fantastic time in Nashville with a few glitches at the Hutton.",

It wasn't just a little long... it was about 4 inches too long. When I called Yelena she said she could get it done, and that she'd just have to charge me a rush fee (which I was more than okay with.) \n\nI brought it in and she had me try it on... do take the time to do that vs. just telling her how much to take off. The dress ended up being longer in certain places so she really had to pin differently all the way around it. Even with that, though, I had it dropped off in about ten minutes.\n\nWhen I picked it up on my way to the lake for the wedding, I just gave it a quick glance and was happy to see that the new hem line was flawless. Later that weekend when I put it on, I was even happier... it was the perfect length, just skimming the floor. Happy times indeed.\n\nI'm grateful she was able to help me in a pinch and it was well worth the $35. I'm going to bring her a handful of things next week because I've been waiting to find someone who does such quality work.\n\nThank you Yelena!",

There were four bartenders behind the bar, all avoiding eye contact like it would kill them to throw a menu to us. One had air pods in, looking uninterested. The woman who finally gave us a menu after 11 minutes of sitting at the bar was chewing gum aggressively. We had the menus for about 5 minutes with no drinks, hadn't even gotten the chance to order water.

That I should at-least be compensated to a 12\" in sandwich for my inconvenience, since she wouldn't allow the dasher to reorder it. I paid 8 bucks there and back for a lyft, not to mention the door dash fees. For her to act like this service I received was perfectly fine? Look at this sandwich!

  "text": "I have had good and bad experiences at Walgreens Pharmacy at Rancho Vistoso. The only BAD experiences I had was when I was using pain medication, and they were extremely stringent to the point of being rude . But, that was long ago. The pharmacy manager at the time was very kind to make sure my orders were in, as I had an unusual prescription. \n\nHowever, now that I am no longer on constant pain medications I have had nothing but GREAT experiences there. All of the pharmacy techs are kind, caring and efficient. They remember me, which often surprises me, as I am not there often. That makes the place seem like your hometown pharmacy, which is rare in this impersonal age \n\nAnd they never fail to give my service dog a treat, which makes the experience extra special. \n\nI would never use another pharmacy in this area. I highly recommend Walgreens",

This place did not disappoint. \n\nWe had  the pizza and wings . The  pizzas flavor was very good. The crust of the pizza was very crispy and flavorful. They use fresh ingredients and high-quality for the pizza . The wings were good but nothing to write home about. The had good flavor and we're not to sauced. The meat was moist so overall a good wing ! I saw a bunch of people get the cheese steaks next time I will try that!!",

Unfortunately, I went back to Spitale's on two different occasions recently and the food has gone downhill. The first time I went back, I ordered the Red Beans and Sausage lunch plate...the beans were beyond bland and the sausage was tough and rubbery. I could heat up Blue Runner beans and cook sausage at home and it would taste better than the $12 lunch platter that I bought. The second time I ordered a salad to go. I know, ordering salad from a deli is dumb, but it's hard to screw up a salad. The veggies were soggy and the chicken was flavorless. I don't think I'll be ordering from Spitale's anytime soon.",

I have been calling for the past 4 months asking them to submit the claim to insurance.  They say that they will, but they don't.  When I call the following month - they say that they didn't submit to insurance since it isn't covered.  I just got off the phone with my insurance company.  It should have all been covered less a $20 co-pay.  I'm just going to submit the claim myself since I can't get Premier to do it.  A friend had a similar situation.

After checking out the different services, you hop out of your car and tell the attendant what you'd like. From there you walk through the building where you reach the cashier to pay for your service. There are benches outside that are covered by umbrellas. \n\nThe washers did a great job washing my car and really took their time. Overall I was satisfied but did see some room for improvement. 1.

None of the chefs were Asian.... and I was the only Asian person there customer wise. Not like that's an issue.... but if you're wanting to go to a more authentic noodle/ramen bar i'd suggest heading to china town. The broth for the miso ramen was pretty tasty but the pork was disappointing. It's shredded like as if you were to get a pulled pork sandwich. The pork in ramen is my favorite part of the soup so this was a downside for me. Also thought it was overpriced. Overall if you're on a date wanting to try somewhere new this place is not that bad but not a staple go to.",

The crab flavor was strong and the corn had a good bite to it.\n\nGumbo- M liked it more than me. He remembers liking it more last year. Not a big fan of all the okra.\n\nShrimp & Grits- Yum! I liked the heartiness of the grits and the sauce was tasty. Good amount of shrimp.\n\nP&J oysters- I didn't have any but M like these a lot.\n\nNow onto the bad. Our waiter was never really around. After having the fritters, we were served the oysters but our table didn't get cleared of the empty basket of fritters. After the our entrees came, the basket of fritters,the oysters, and dirty appetizer plates were still sitting empty on our table. We had not received the gumbo we ordered so someone else (still haven't seen our waiter) brought it out. \n\nWhen Matt was 80% done with his main entree, our waiter finally came to check on us and asked if we needed anything from him. Uhh... Yea! How about clearing the table? Or checking to see how our food was because maybe then he would have known we were served our last appetizer after we were already served our entree. \n\nFood was great, but the subpar service tainted the experience. We did let a manager know on the way out. If our server was around we could have told him too.",

The waitstaff is normally decent; it's a diner so don't expect much. \n\nIt is crazy how this place is open 24-7 and someone is always there eating something. We once saw a family there at 4am who were talking about how they just finished driving home from a road trip vacation, and all they wanted to do was eat at Tom Jone's, and then go to bed. On Sunday after church it is crazy, and the line is out the door. When we were in our early 20's we'd often have parties and send the late-night people to Tom Jones for some food to sober up. They always loved it. There is something about the atmosphere, reminds me of \"Pulp Fiction\" somehow, in a vintage way.\n\nWhat to eat? BLUE RIBBON, Baby! Last time we bought... for $3.89 you get: 2 sausages + 2 bacon + 2 pancakes + 2 eggs + OJ + coffee + 2 slices toast !!!!\n\nIt is always done FAST and it's always decent diner quality.\n\nBrookhaven is dry so don't expect any booze here.\n\nIt sucks, but CASH ONLY!\n\nThey have a walk-up pick up window on the side, but any time we ever did pick up they never used it.\n\n(This place is so Delco, Tommy Pope's gotta know about it... hopefully we may see a rendition of it in his Comedy Central \"Delco Proper\" webisodes.)",

  "text": "Himalayan Yeti serves Indian and Nepalese cuisine. This was actually our second time coming to Himalayan Yeti because the first time was so delish!  We wanted to try the Momo (Indian Dumplings) and have our take at the lunch buffet again! \n\nLet me start by raving about their Tikki Masala!  Seriously, some of the best or at least right up there as a top contender!  The chicken breast dices were tender and the sauce really flavorful with all the spices balancing perfectly.  If you want a unique Indian appetizer, try the Veggie or Chicken Momo!  They are homemade and are a type of potsticker/dumpling full of Indian spices. We ordered them steamed and they were extremely fresh.  The Chicken Curry and the Aloo Golbi/Navratan Korma (whichever it was) were also delicious.  I always get the Saag of whatever kind the restaurant offers, and this Saag Paneer was not the best, but still pretty great. \nNow the best part...Gulab Jamun! Warm, fried, soft, and soaked in honey dessert balls that melt in your mouth.  These are a must along with everything else.  \n\nI don't think I need to say to go try Himalayan Yeti, so just eat there!",

I made the mistake of not checking the yelp reviews, and went ahead and ordered. I had the grilled fish sandwich with fries. Not very flavorful but it did the job. Well...a few hours went by, and I started feeling nauseous. I concluded that it was the fish that was upsetting my stomach. I felt like this the rest of the weekend, and tonight the nausea finally got the best of me. \nI don't recommend getting seafood from this spot, but there's plenty of other options that may be okay.

I also ordered a caramel granola shake (the special), which was fantastic, but the food was so heavy, I couldn't finish either. I also snuck a taste of my date's side of green beans with onions and bacon, which were also delicious.

After what I would call a very long day and tiring search for a place to eat, we stopped at Marras, which on the outside looked like a new and nice place to eat. That was not the case at all: the food was cold, the presentation wasn't very good, and the whole ordeal was both disorienting and disappointing. \nEvery single item on the menu was underwhelming. \nThe decor was cute, but the over all vibe and feel of the place was so strange. I could tell it was a family restaurant, and it felt like everyone in there had known each other for years... such a weird thing to walk into. In all honesty the service itself wasn't horrible, just a very disjointed part of a very surreal dining experience.\nMy waitress's was so sweet that I felt bad (and still do) about this review but... this place is not quality dining. I'd also like to say that for what you get that it's VERY overpriced, and Im not someone who minds spending food.",

  "text": "In brief, Food = not good.  Service = left a lot to be desired.  Took a recent quick trip to New Orleans on a roadtrip to Houston this past weekend.  Stopped in NOLA Friday night and wanted to grab brunch before we got on the road Saturday.  This place was around the corner from our hotel.  I'd wanted to go to Ruby Slippers down the street but there was a 2+ hour wait. This place said 10 minutes, so we said fine (maybe that should have been a red flag but we were in a time crunch so went ahead anyway). \n\nOverall, the food items were really strange I thought, and not good. My husband and his 2 friends didn't finish all of their food which I feel is an indication.  My sausage and cheese omelette had a full sausage inside the omelette (not chopped up or anything) which I have never seen before and was really weird (and slightly off-putting).   But the worst part about it was the service.  I ordered the red sauce on the side, and when my food came out, the entire thing was slathered in red sauce.  When I commented on this to the waiter, he said \"that's right you got sauce on the side\" then stood there and basically told me to give it a try because otherwise they'd have to make a new omelette. To top it off, he also got the wrong sides for 2 of the guys in my party.  Again, no offer to correct what he had messed up - I was just very shocked at his reaction.  Would not recommend this place even if it is a way shorter wait than other places around.",

Their donuts melt in your mouth and are always a treat to bring into the office or for friends. I work in an office that a majority of people are not from Indianapolis, I blew their minds this morning with the donuts from Long's! I have never been when there wasn't a line, however, it moves quickly. As well, the parking is not the best, but you could use a walk back to and from the car before eating a couple of these donuts!",

  "text": "This place is so hard to rate! The food is ridiculous. Everything I've ever eaten, buffet included, is so good. (I refuse to eat buffet food, but I make an exception for this place.) Bad news: despite the awesomeness of the food, the service here is horrible. The staff is friendly, don't get me wrong. But they are not fast nor are they attentive. The food is never bad, the staff is never rude, but do not eat here if you're in a hurry. You won't get prompt refills, you won't get your check when you need it, but the food is so good that, if you have the time, it's totally worth it. I feel like they need a seminar for the staff on how to wait tables and then this would be five stars all the way. Either way, I need their chicken tikka masala in my life.",

  "text": "Found this place after driving most of the day. We were getting real hungry and yelping for some good grub. Looked at the reviews and had high hopes. I've found that sometimes good reviews set you up to be disappointed, this wasn't one of those times.  \nWe had the cheeseburger egg rolls. Wasn't sure what to expect but wow. It was like a juicy cheeseburger wrapped inside an egg roll wrapper. The dipping sauce really set it off. My only regret was sharing this order with my partner. I would advise asking for an extra sauce, it wasn't quite enough if you like heavy dipping. \nI had the vineyard chicken sandwich. Chicken was good, not dry.  All the flavors just complimented each other. The fries were nice and fresh looking.  Skin on 3/8 cut presented in a small bucket. \nMy partner had the real deal Swedish meatballs. She couldn't finish the whole plate.  Meat was flavorful and not dry. Potatoes were buttery and seasoned slightly.  Gravy was good. \nPrice was ok, quality of the food justified it and for this area of California I expected higher prices. Quantity was good with the appetizer.",

  "text": "Food is outstanding, but the decor and service are deplorable. We were a party of eight on a Thursday night with a 7pm reservation, and the restaurant was a ghost town. The uncomfortable chairs with the dollar store seat cushions  were from an average reception hall, the table uneven because of the extended leaves transforming a square table to round and unless you are seated by a window, you could be in any average restaurant. The staff were dressed for a rodeo, clumsy and untrained, randomly picking up and dropping off dishes. The trendy, hipster manager spent more time smiling at his cell phone than engaging with guests. The average price of an entree was $35 with an a-la-carte option for salad and garnish. The only included item was the bread that was as fresh as the rolls at the box grocery stores.  Again, while the entrees were well above average, the rest of this experience is labeled a tourist trap and I doubt locals visit often unless they have a disposable income and overlook the lack of attention or concern to guest experiences.",

I didn't notice it was under cooked until after a few bites and then I told our server. She completely agreed so that part was not a problem. I was just surprised that they took the fish off my plate and back to the kitchen to cook further instead of taking my entire plate. Having the rest of my food and my utensils on the plate with under cooked fish made me nervous. I also was surprised that they didn't offer some sort of complimentary food or price break. When the Sea Bass was returned to me it was over cooked. Not horrible but enough that it was somewhat dry and tough. I will probably never return to Brophy's after this experience. I also sampled the clam chowder and it was very salty. I think this restaurant has gone downhill. Too bad. It used to be a great restaurant known for their freshness.",

  "text": "I stayed here for the night with my boyfriend and wasn't impressed at all. Our plans were to stay the night, enjoyed lobster buffet and gamble. The website for hotel booking was hard to use and phone just rang when you called hotel. I finally got our room booked after struggling with the website for over 30 mins. When I got here, the service was ok. I checked in quickly and had no issues with the front desk guy. However, we decided to check out the room before we head our way to the buffet. We noticed a line outside the buffet but thought we would drop our stuff inside the room and check it out. When I got to the room, right away I noticed a smell of smoke. I saw a ashtray and realized we were accidently booked a smoking room. We don't smoke so we wanted our room to be changed. So, back to the front desk we went to ask for a different room. At this time, we noticed the buffet line had grew twice the size. The same front desk guy helped us. He quickly tried to change the room and went to the back to speak to his manager. After a few minutes he returned and told us they had no more rooms available and would have to keep our smoking room. He told me they don't guarantee third party booking sites. But, I didn't use a third party and told him this. He looked again and told me he would see if he could get me a suite upgrade since that the only thing available. This took another 5 to ten minutes. When he returmed, he told us they were able to change some things and get another room but no upgrade or anything for our time wasted. But, I was relieved to at least have a non smoking room. Anyone who does use a third party agency should be very careful since they won't do much to help you if you do book the wrong room. Of course, by the time the buffet line was even longer. Our service here was ok. Our waiter was helpful and resturaunt was clean. A random person left plates on our table and the lobster was overcooked. However, the prime rib, fried chicken and pork was very tasty. It was just jamed pack and long wait. After dinner we checked our room and noticed we were missing a shower curtain. We requested a shower curtain but  this took a awhile to get a new one. Lastly, the next day we were woken up with housekeeping knocking on our door around 8am. This really was the last straw that made me want to write this review.  We were up pretty late and were looking forward to sleeping in. Honestly, I feel that this hotel needs to work on customer service and helping the customer have a nice stay. They should try to make the customer happy and give some of incentive/comp if they mess up.",

I usually round out around $12. Presentation is great whether you dine in or take out. \nThis maybe a weird note, but the water from pop machine is CRISP and delicious and they have some specialty brand of pops. \nI give this place two thumbs up in a Philly sea of just okay taco joints!

I mean a crab omelet, a chorizo omelet, famous fried chicken, fried pickles, buffalo pizza, Mexican pizza.....the description on all these items make them sound great. \n\nI've been her twice and was really not impressed with breakfast....I will continue to come and find what I love though, because lunch seems more like appealing to me. My hubby-to-be loves the pancakes and omelets though (especially the chorizo one).\n\nMy recommendation if you love spicy food:\n\nBuffalo chicken pizza. SUPER spicy food that is....the buffalo chicken pizza will make a grown man cry. I normally like spicy food, and buffalo sauce is one of those things that varies so much in heat depending on the place. Well, this place definitely PACKS the heat! It came out of the kitchen bubbling with red sauce and I needed a milkshake to get past the first slice. \n\nIf you are sharing an appetizer: \n\nBaked Junkyard fries - gross name, but sooo good! They have cheese, chorizo, melted cheese, sour cream and all sorts of amazingness! I think if I ever end up pregnant, this is what my fetus and I would constantly crave. \n\nI would skip:\nDenver scramble. which sounds delicious with Sauteed Potatoes, Mushrooms, Onions and Peppers, Topped with Cheddar Cheese and 2 Scrambled Eggs...but it's not. The potatoes were not seasoned with any pepper or salt, and everything is just thrown together like a bad batch of hash browns. Also, it's a small portion compared to the other breakfast platters, so plan accordingly. \n\nI will definitely be returning to try their famous chicken, and the service is always friendly and just overall there is something very inviting about the place...especially their outside area in a cool summer day.",

He was so excited the whole time. \"Your hair is going to be bananas!\"\n\nAs a stylist, Anthony really takes a good deal of pride in his work. While working on me he still had time to run around and assist some of the younger stylists with their clients. He seriously seems to love his job.\n\nMariposa has a cool monitor in front of the mirror streaming popular Tweets and celebrity news and trivia (sort of like the monitors in taxis). The monitors also had a system where you entered all of your personal info about your hair. Curly/straight/colored/conditioned/products used, etc. This then allows the system to match you with the ideal product that you should use on your hair. Pretty cool.\n\nAnthony was so fun and my time in the chair flew by. By the time he was finished I had a whole new look and all of the other stylists were complimenting him on his work.\n\nDefinitely will be going back soon!",

The (green) waitress we had kept coming over and shrugging her shoulders telling us that she didn't know what was going on.  \n\nA horrible experience.",

I have never taken a tour, but definitely want to do that soon, as well as their tasting room.\n\nYou walk into a fairly large and open seating area, with a bar in the back.  For being a brewery, the seating area is pretty small, and gets tight with the pool table and shuffleboard.  It makes sense that they're moving to 5th and Spring Garden and I'm extremely happy they are, and can't wait to see the new digs.\n\nEvery bartender I've spoken with has been pleasant and everything from the Brawler, to the Pale Ale, to the IPA, is tasty.  Most recently, I got a flight of their different holiday-themed beers and they were all great.  You can't go wrong.\n\nOverall a fun spot to chill, but beware, it gets crowded on rainy days.  With the new location coming later this year, I'm hoping for a larger area to hang, drink, eat, and play games.",

  "text": "Moved to the area in July and have been trying out different restaurants each weekend. So far most have been a disappointment., and we haven't found one to which we'd return.  Inchins Bamboo Garden has restored my faith in the suburban Asian restaurant. My standards are high, having grown up in a city with a bonafide Chinatown and no shortage of great restaurants in general.This is a restaurant we will definitely return to and will recommend. \n\nWe had Mushroom Salt Pepper, Shrimp Salt Pepper and Vegetarian Lettuce Wraps to start. All were very good. Food was fresh and presented nicely. Would order each again, but will likely try other items because there are so many intriguing options to choose from. \n\nThe entrees we ordered were Basil Fried Rice (vegetarian), Fish in Cilantro Sauce and Broccoli Beef. All were good.\n\nService was very attentive. Waiter, busboy and manager/owner were all serving and checking on our table. \n\nThe assortment of 6 hot sauces on the table is great, and allows individual diners to add the amount of heat they each desire.\n\nTruly the only Asian restaurant we've been to that we will definitely return to and we're glad it's only 3 miles from home.\n\nThe Chinese/Indian fusion results is interesting and delicious food. Give it a try.\nThe restaurant was not very busy on a Saturday night at 7:00PM; I hope the community supports this place because it's a great addition to the restaurant scene here in Lawrence Township.",

They were easy to deal with from the start, showing me around despite me popping in without even a phone call. And then when working with them over the phone and email, everything was straight-forward and helpful. The event went off without a hitch and the staff was ready for anything and everything. Everybody was willing to help, regardless on if it was their \"department\" or not. They saved me when my ipod stopped working; they took care of proper sound for presentations and even climbed up on a chair to cut down a banner I had hung. I highly recommend Jackson's for any sort of event - with the Waterfront Room being a top-notch location for a fun and memorable event.",

My favorite part of Shogun is the fried rice. I'm not sure what they add differently, but it's ridiculously better than anywhere else I've eaten. \n\nThe steak was cooked like I asked and the rest of the meal is how you'd expect at a hibachi place. The sushi we ordered was great as well. \n\nI'm taking a star off for a few reasons. First, it's more expensive than hibachi places in the area. Second, the salad dressing was a little runny.

The dishes seem to more bland and not well prepared. The beef and broccoli has tough pieces of beef that doesn't taste good either, and the sauce is runny without much flavor. The Singapore noodles are bland with no minimal veggies or meats. Their other chef specialty dishes has mainly onions and peppers to mask the lack of meat. Also, most of their dishes are dripping in oil, more than the usual chinese place. Now I know, this isn't authentic chinese food, but I do like my fixes of americanized-chinese food. This just isn't the place for me anymore. Wing Hing, I hope you get your act together because your pork fried rice is still pretty darn delicious - I want to like you again!",

  "text": "On one of the most non-descript corners of South Philadelphia, this tiny Indonesian eatery cooks up hearty dishes on a daily basis.  What sets Seulanga Cafe apart from other Indonesian spots in Philly is that this is a restaurant specializing in the foods from the island of Sumatra...a true Nasi Padang place.  And that of course is what I ordered.  The meal was decent enough without being anything special.  One of the reasons for this is that the food here is served cafeteria style meaning that it is not cooked to order but sits in the warming pans for a while.  Also there were no knives among the plastic utensils making the chicken especially difficult to eat.   They do have a tray of sauces you can avail yourself of to give a bit more flavor to the food.  But probably most noticeable when all is said and done - this Indonesian café was nowhere near as friendly as most of the other ones in Philadelphia.  Still if you have a hankering for Nasi Padang, give it a try and see what you think.",

Not the most tender, but still easy to get off the bone\n- Sandwiches: We got the pulled pork, prime rib and beef brisket; the best one was the brisket by far. The other two were about tied, hah.\n- Beans: I love their beans!! Not too sweet, not too heavy. yUmms\n- Pork skin: we got it because we wanted to try it. Verdict? We don't like pork skins. But you could tell they were fresh (came hot) and it was really good-looking... we just don't like pork skins, hah\n- Slaw: really good too, went well with my meat!\n- Sauces: I think there were about 3. My favorite was the sweet but that's because I love sweet things, hehe. The table's least favorite was the one with the V on it.\n\nI also want to point out that they pack up take-out REALLY well!! Everything was nicely packaged and separate and was very easy to just unwrap the goodness (I felt like a kid on Christmas day) and feast! Also, it only took TWENTY minutes!!!\n\nOverall: BBQ is BBQ, but Bogart's does a darn good job. Save the line-standing at Pappy's and just come here :) Oh and get beer at iTap while you're at it ;)",

  "text": "Our party of six had a stellar dinner on Sunday night. It was an impromptu visit after a long day and they greeted us warmly.\nEver aspect was on point. Service was attentive but not hovering. Our meals were above and beyond. Even our cocktails didn't disappoint. One friend and I enjoyed the Roma Paloma which was delicious and had great attention to detail. It included a grilled slice of grapefruit! Holy garnish, Batman! \nAs for our food selections, I had the squid ink pasta with shrimp that was so flavorful and rich with garlic, I kept laughing and making yummy sounds with each bite. My husband had the truffle pasta which was equally flavorful and complex. Another friend had the bone in filet which was thick and cooked perfectly per report. Others had a selection of small plates or the charcuterie board that was impressive! Even my Caesar salad was special. A beautifully arranged (almost flower pattern) of greens hearts with a creamy delicious dressing.\nDessert didn't disappoint. We got an assortment and one was better than the next.\nThank you, Chad-Assistant Manager, and David-server, for an exceptional dining experience. We look forward to returning soon!\n\nI'd also like to add that my husband and I had tried this restaurant 2 years ago and had a terrible experience. Chad said they have a new chef and management since then. It shows!!\nYou won't be disappointed!",

No one was in the lobby (including an employee) or waiting area. 3 cars were in the shop. I waited ~10 minutes until someone finally came into the lobby. I asked for some recommendations/estimates on tires. He asked for my name and number and told me he would call me with some information. When I asked why he couldn't talk to me now since I was standing right there, he said \"well, I kind of have a lot to do.\" At this point, there was still no one in the lobby and one car in the garage. And guess what? Still waiting for that phone call over a week later.\n\nNot going to beg you to take my money, not going back. Poor customer service. I would believe the reviews about understaffing. \n\nTry RW Tires in Bordentown. Excellent customer service, large selection, great prices.",

We ordered cheeseburgers, fries, and milkshakes (Vanilla for them and Marshmallow for me, a departure from my usual Pineapple). The burgers were fresh and tasty and the milkshakes were delicious as always, not to mention thick enough that my forehead almost caved in trying to suck it up through a straw! We solved that problem by working on them with spoons until they had melted a little. Overall a wonderful meal enjoyed by all of us.",

They offer you complimentary drinks and the place interior is gorgeous compared to other local shops that do not put effort or money into salon presentation! They for sure value customer service and take their time with clients and walk-ins. I did not feel like I was robbed for my money and I received the service that I wanted without having to debate with nail tech. The wait time is a little longer, but it's worth it when your spending your hard earned money.

This location, by far, was the créme de la créme on every level. Customer service was beyond superb. An 11!!! Bradley, Manager, was the most helpful, friendliest, informative, patient catering manager I've ever had the pleasure of doing business with. Seriously thought I was speaking with someone from Nashville, TN (as many Southerners are very hospitable and kind). Not only did this stop with the order but continued when I updated our order to the day of the event. They called ME! to check if I was still picking up at confirmed time, so they could place the chicken in warmers to be sure we got a fresh and ready batch!!! WOW!!! Then...the FOOD was perfection!!! Everyone at the event asked where this was from and raved about it. Generous portions and sizes. Great value for the price! Thank goodness we had some leftover for the guests of honor to take home for out of town guests and to indulge in one of their favorite foods (specifically from this establishment). Go here or order from here. You will not be disappointed!!!\nFYI: Heard they're opening another location in Broad Ripple ;)",

  "text": "Delicious food and friendly family service at 999 Pho - the best Vietnamese restaurant in Reno in our opinion.  \n\nThey have dozens of unusual dishes. This one consists of  large BBQ'ed pork chop, egg cake, shrimp cake (delicious), and a serving of what's called pork skin (but isn't fatty at all). Its served on a bed of salad with a side of broken rice.\n\nThe clear liquid is fish sauce - which tastes odd by itself but is wonderful on the food. Rather than avoid this, start off by using just a little and then, as you develop a taste for it, you can increase the amount you use. I love fish sauce and usually order a second bowl for my food.\n\n999 Pho has many other wonderful dishes including numerous bun ones which are a vermicelli like rice noodle. These dishes may include a combination of a large quantity of barbecue pork strips, BBQ shrimp, egg rolls, and other items served with an abundance of crisp fresh vegetables such as shredded lettuce, bean sprouts, cilantro, basil, optional jalapeño peppers, and more.\n\nThey also have a wide variety of beef, pork, seafood, and other pho (soups, pronounced \"fuh\").",

My son went to an interview with a man that was rude and didn't even look at my son through the very brief conversation.  This to me is a simple sign of a racist person/store as we are puerto rican and dark skin.....my son is very educated.....great school grades...honors....speaks very proper....is clean cut and neat BUT the man had no time to properly interview my son because he was not white nor a female!!! The other candidates were white young girls with whom it appears the man interview perked up for them!!!! This is 2016 and yet racist people still exist and prevent other minority people from working honestly. We are a very educated family and are professionals.......we are Christians......and....my sons have never been in trouble so as a mother of two men this situation angers me!!! This store  appears to only hire white people!!!! I was in this store a few weeks ago and the older man at the register proceeded to tell me his personal divorce problems....which I felt was very inappropriate but I let it go!!! Maybe that his store should look at hiring professional people and MINORITIES!!!! It is illegal to NOT hire someone based on the color of their skin!!!!!

  "text": "This was our home away from home for the Christmas holiday, and we enjoyed our stay immensely. We paid extra for the deluxe king room, so there was room for more than just a bed, and we didn't feel crowded. Plus - bonus - our room actually had a view of the Mississippi River, and it was strangely addicting to just stand there and watch the barges and tugs go by. I also loved that there was a Keurig coffee maker in the room.\n\nThe hotel was beautifully decorated for the Christmas holiday, so there were always people hanging out in the lobby and bar just enjoying the scenery or taking pictures. This is a crowded time of year for New Orleans, and the Carousel Bar in the hotel was always packed, but fortunately we were able to belly up to the bar next to the hotel restaurant, and sample their specialty holiday cocktails.  We had Christmas lunch at Criollo Restaurant in the hotel, and it was surprisingly good-with the desserts being exceptional.\n\nI do NOT think the staff is as professional as it is at other NOLA hotels we've stayed at: friends we were traveling with had constant issues with the staff and a scooter they rented, plus the doormen seemed to be more interested in chatting with each other than opening doors, saying hello, etc. Also, I think noise is a problem in all of these old hotels, and this one is no exception.  However, since we travel with a small speaker so we can sleep with white noise, this wasn't really an issue for us.\n\nThe location of the hotel is hard to beat, the elevators were surprisingly fast, and as a whole, we had a very good time here.",

I didn't have to worry about a single thing and I have her to think for it. She was efficient and compassionate, and I appreciate everything that she did for us. I would recommend Jenny and The Lange Farms in a heartbeat! \n\nJust to give you a little bit of context I had issues with my bridal party. My entire bridal party was over an hour late and I had to hide out in the bridal suite waiting for my dress and veil to arrive. Jenny kept me calm and help me with my dress and veil and shoes when none of my bridal party assisted me. She spent the evening looking out for me and making sure that I was enjoying myself and not worrying about a thing. Because of her I was able to enjoy the moment completely and I have memories to last a lifetime.",

At $30, I thought it was a pretty good price for what you get based on my experience at visiting other places on the main line. \n\nShe did such a great job shaping my nails, getting the polish on nicely (w/o bumps or chips) and cleaning up my cuticles. I loved the massage. She used a hot rock which felt so relaxing. \n\nThey have a lot of great specials which I would definitely take advantage of - $10 manicure during their morning hours.\n\nI would come back if I wasn't moving away! I highly recommend this place!!",

Afetr a round of fried goodnees - DH had the cheese fries and I had some really outstanding O-rings - we were on to our main attraction.\n\nDH had a cheese steak with Provolone and it was terrific.\nI enjoyed a garlicky plate of Veal Scallopini that was kickin' in old school.  This was THE $#!T - for real.  Mushrooms, green peppers, onions and tender veal (wish there had been a bit more of that) in a garlicky, olive-oily sauce that reminded me of how my Nonna woulda done it.\n\nUm.

  "text": "I have literally avoided writing bad reviews during COVID and have been deleting previous ones. But this is the one time I felt let down by Yelp. I came here expecting the 4.5 start experience and got something below mediocre even though we were hungry and would have been easy to impress. Firstly, yes it's expensive. But I have never had an issue with price when getting something worthwhile. The decor was not mind blowing and neither was the service. It was GOOD. Then comes the menu with \"fattoush\" and \"tabouleh\" labels and clear attempts to sound Mediterranean. Tabouleh had broccoli, there was NOTHING tabouleh about it. Would people call a bagel a croissant? Or a burger a philly cheese steak? That's what this place was doing. It is a little offensive to middle eastern people that food labels would be exploited to that level. There is so much room for creativity when it comes to modernizing traditional dishes but this place was just all over the place. Nothing made sense. The fattoush was literally kale and apples. Fattoush is traditionally a finely chopped salad with cucumbers, tomatoes, parsley, and toasted/ deep friend pita as the essential ingredients then it varies from one Arabic country to another but they ALL drown the salad with olive oil. This salad had no trace of olive oil or fattoush. We liked the idea of the carrot hummus but it tasted like bland purée. There was no texture, it was so runny and just a major fail. I never thought it was possible to screw up hummus, but I guess I was wrong. The cherry on top was that the hummus isn't served with complimentary pita, we had to order a tiny pita. What are $2 for a fine dining type of restaurant? Why would you even charge your customers for bread? Customers who'd frequent these types of restaurants would be indifferent about an extra $2, but I know it simply does not reflect well on the owners. I wondered if perhaps the owners had ever seen people scoop out hummus with a spoon to eat it? I was very confused. That said, the complimentary side dish of fresh herbs, cucumbers and turnips was a nice touch. Secondly, 3 out of the 4 things we ordered were just drowning in dill. The menu had not mentioned the dill, but I felt like all I could taste was the dill. Garnish in Mediterranean food varies and dill is probably one of the least used herbs for garnish. The fish was the least offensive dish, (the one thing that is served with dill didn't have dill in it ) but the side of rice which had delicious chopped preserved lemons was drowning in an extremely salty scoop of butter. We had to dump the butter out to be able to enjoy the rice. I couldn't help but wonder if the restaurant had just run out of olive oil. Lastly, to use the restroom, I had to exit the restaurant, walk through a hotel lobby and use a beat up public bathroom. what kind of a 5 star dining experience makes you use a beat up restroom to wash your hands? I felt like this place was just a bit of a scam.  $100 for the two of us was so not worthwhile - I was genuinely upset for sacrificing my last meal in Philly to a place like this. In summary, if you're looking for modern Mediterranean cuisine, look up Illili (Manhattan), Albi (DC), or the following places in Philly: Zahav, Surayya, Cafe La Maude, etc.",

  "text": "After my daughter graduated from the University of Arizona in Tucson, I needed to figure out a way to move all her things back to Illinois.  As she has a compact car, renting a UHaul and driving it across the country was not a viable option. I also looked into packing everything up and shipping via UPS or the USPS.  Once again, way too expensive and not a viable option. I looked into one-way truck rentals (Penske was reasonable), but then reconsidered when I factored in the gas, hotels, meals, and 2+ days of driving across the country in the middle of winter.  I finally found U-Pack and knew it was the way to go. The online reservation was simple. I called their 800 number to have some questions answered and found out they even offered a student discount.  The price was very reasonable. I chose to drop off and pick up our belongings to save quite a bit of money. They gave me step-by-step information on how the move would be handled and what I needed to know to prepare for the move.  I knew this was the best option for us.  I had everything boxed in Rubbermaid totes so transporting our belongings into the U-Pack pod was very simple and quick.  They said there was enough room for a one-bedroom apartment and we had room to spare.  We loaded everything into the U-Pack in Tucson (it took about 15 minutes from check-in until we drove out of the parking lot).  Within an hour, I got an email telling me that our pod was loaded onto a truck and had left for our destination.  We expected our pod to arrive 5-7 days in Illinois.  It arrived in 4.  I got a phone call and an email informing me that it was ready to be unloaded. I drove out to the facility in Sauk Village, IL, the following morning.  The unloading process took about 15 minutes from checking in with the office to getting our pod delivered (via forklift) to my car, unloading the pod, and driving out of the trucking center.  I still am amazed at how convenient this was.  I am very thankful that I found U-Pack.\n\nAnother thing to consider:  Rather than taking several trips back and forth to load/unload the U-Pack, I rented a moving van from Home Depot in Arizona and again in Illinois to be able to make one trip to the U-Pack facilities.  They charged $19.95 for up to 90 minutes (plus return the gas tank filled). Home Depot doesn't charge a mileage fee.",

On each and every time that I've gone there (about 4x) there have been cashiers and others without face masks or with masks pulled below the nose. On my last visit I pointed out an employee without a mask to the manager. He told me that he wasn't near anyone and more or less just blew it off. What he didn't also know was that this same employee passed next to me in the aisle as I was coming in to shop -- without a mask. \nMy problem is that Dorignac's doesn't seem to care about its customers. No curbside pickup, senior hour only 2 mornings per week, no cart sanitation, and most of all an attitude that they are above it. I won't be returning and I suggest that anyone that does uses personal precautions because Dorignac's takes little to none.",

  "text": "Mid 1980s my family started with this vet/ending 12/2012. Easy to say, spending close to $10,000.00. When shot time-7 animals getting shots in 1month,everything from good news to bad.  I never thought of them as the Best not the worst until the 1st wk of April. When calling about Sat Hrs(it was 1045am)closing at 11am- I was placed on hold for 4mins while the help checked for my records. My Cat, sudden sever problem-prompting the call, the help tells me I live to far from them(not 3 miles) would not be there before CLOSING @ 11am Saturday, was also rudely told to go to Levittown(40min ride at least on a Saturday). I asked are you kidding me, her reply\"Well I don't know where you live\"....I guess she didn't really look my family name up in the records or she would have known my address.  What a Self-Centered, Poor Excuse for for what one would think to be a Caring, Concerned for Life, Quality of life........just a very sad display of Customer Service.  However the BEST DISPLAY I have ever experienced of \"CLOSING TIME\", hurry up Eleven o'clock.  I would never own a pet again if I had to deal with that type of business and the Representative of same business because that person showed no concern for animal live or even the slightest compassion for an animal who was in need of medical help.   THE GOOD NEWS  BUCKS COUNTY  VETS.  THANK YOU  Warminster Veterinary Hospital  for steering my business away, to a Vet and Staff that TRULY CARES about your pet and you.  To bad I have to give 1 undeserved star.",

  "text": "I have ordered from this place many times now probably almost once a week or so. I have always had a pleasant professional experience up till now and after today i am very upset and will probably never order from them again due to the way I was treated today. I called around 3 wed apr 6. I tried to order the \"spinach alfredo\" which was listed on the websites menu. The lady taking the order did not recognize the item so i was looking for my physical copy of the menu to see if it was on there (which it wasn't) then a very rude gentlemen with a heavy accent (who was apparently the manager) took the phone from her and demanded to know my order to which i said i wanted the pasta milano, he then repeated the order back to me very quickly and it didn't sound right and then he hung up immediately . well the order got to my house and it was wrong. It was the \"pasta new orleans\" which has shrimp in it which im deathly allergic to. I have worked in a lot of restaurants and normally i don't complain if the order is wrong and will just take it anyways but since it was shrimp i told the delivery driver i would not be able to eat it and i was not going to pay for it. He was kind and professional. He called his manager to see what to do, the manager asked to talk to me. Before i could explain he demanded that i pay for it since he had taken the call personally, he said \"you did not know what you want i gave you what you want\" i tried to explain  i would never in a million years order anything with shrimp. He would not listen, talking over me demanding that i pay for the order saying quote \n\n\" F*** YOU I WILL CALL THE POLICE YOU ARE F***ING SH***Y CUSTOMER YOU PAY FOR THE ORDER\" \n\nI have worked restaurant and service industry jobs for most of my life and buddy i gotta say don't say f*** at a customer is probably rule number one. Quickly followed by don't insult your customer... try to make them happy, quickly followed by make the extra effort for your regulars who are usually generous and have never complained before. I have never even thought don't call the cops on them because they are unhappy with their service was even eligible to be on the list of\nWhat not to do but now im adding it to my list. \n\nSo i told him ok fine go call the cops i would love to speak with them and i tipped the delivery guy a little extra for his having to be party to this and because i felt sorry for him that this a**hole is his boss. Well the cops haven't showed up yet i doubt they will but here is where it gets kinda creepy. The manager called my personal phone with his personal phone to tell me 'now you have my personal number' to which i responded \"I don't need it\" and hung up. so i feel a little threatened personally idk what kinda bad day this guy is having but i wasn't being irate or confrontational in the slightest with this guy at all. I didn't ask for anything free or compensation just simply 'i wont pay for that cause i cant  it sorry\" and now he is threatening me? \n\nIf anyone at Tazza is reading this i hope you realize you just lost a regular over this, that guy is not fit to be doing customer service and no one should be treated that way.",

  "text": "My daughter has been staying with us for the holidays, so I've taken it upon myself to broaden her usual diet of potato chips and instant ramen. She's a fan of real food but has been living on a shoestring budget, something I remember quite well from my own bachelor days. So it's somewhat ironic I took her with me to try Minato Noodles, known for ramen and udon noodle dishes.\n\nI started with a house salad of lettuce, carrot, red cabbage, sesame seeds, and thin-sliced avocado, dressed with a housemade blend of soy sauce, vinegar, and a little hint of wasabi ($3). The rest of our appetizers arrived post haste.\n\nTakoyaki--my daughter's favorite--is about the size of a golf ball, deep-fried in wheat flour batter with a gooey filling of tenkasu (tempura scraps), pickled ginger, scallion, and chopped octopus, drizzled with \"Bull-dog\" sauce and sprinkled with chopped scallion and smoked fish flakes ($3 for 3 pieces). The dried, thin bits of fish add a lot of umami to this Osaka street food favorite.\n\nAlso from the fryer were orders of chicken karaage and pork gyoza (both $3 for 5 pieces). The Japanese chicken nuggets and potstickers were crispy and tasty, though not as impressive as the octopus balls. Both were served with a soy and scallion dipping sauce.\n\nMy wife's order of curry with chicken ($11.99) was something of a let-down. Unbeknownst to us, Japanese-style curry is nothing like the Indian and Southeast Asian varieties we know and love. The sauce is similar to brown gravy thickened with grated sweet potato, coating a blend of broccoli, mushroom, onion, cabbage, carrot, and chicken. Being that she found the sauce to be pretty bland, my wife added soy sauce, chili oil, and Sriracha while making a mental note to order something different next time. A ball of steamed rice and a small salad are included on the plate; the salad with that zippy housemade dressing was her favorite part of the dish. \n\nI made a similar goof in the opposite direction. Wanting to try something other than my favorite tonkatsu and miso bowls, I went with spicy sesame ramen noodles swimming in a mix of chili oil, sesame oil, snow pea, bean sprout, onion, scallion, fish flake, garlic, mushroom, bamboo shoot, hot chili powder, nori, sesame seed, and a boiled egg half. Our server offered three levels of spice and I foolishly went with number three, being that I often enjoy Vietnamese and Thai food at their hottest levels. The subtle flavors of ramen broth--pork, beef, chicken--were completely lost in a three-alarm fire of chili. It wasn't the hottest thing I've eaten, but felt a real mismatch combined with all the other ingredients. If you're feeling a bit stuffy, this dish will clear the ol' sinuses right out.\n\nMore successful was an order of bulgogi donburi ($10.99), a popular Korean dish of marinated beef, onion, scallion, cabbage, and enokitake mushroom atop a bed of fluffy, steamed rice. The seasoning was both savory and lightly sweet, greatly enhanced by the delicate, earthy flavor of thread-like fungus. Though quite good as-is, we did add a bit of soy sauce and enjoyed it all the more.\n\nMy daughter's choice of fried rice with seafood was easily the best deal on the table, a generous helping of expertly-cooked clam, octopus, shrimp, squid, and mussel tossed with steamed-then-fried rice full of onion, scallion, mushroom, green bean, carrot, and bell pepper ($7.99 + $2 for seafood). Notable were the molluscs, with both squid and octopus cooked just tender and not a bit rubbery. I'm lucky I got a taste as the hungry student wasted no time becoming one with her bowl of deliciousness.\n\nWith fast service and a menu full of Japanese and Korean options, Minato Noodles is a welcome addition to Reno's burgeoning food scene.",

The server that greeted us didn't come back to our table at all, although I ordered a bottle of water. About 15 minutes later, another server named Maddie come over and and said she would be taking care of us. It was obvious that the place was busy and everyone was running around, yet she still took the time to make us feel important by being friendly, courteous and attentive. She was even helping people around her, cleaning tables, and talking to other guests. Maddie, this review is for you! You are amazing at what you do and certainly know how to give more than exceptional service!!! We will definitely be back to see you.",

The bacon for the blt is kettle cooked, I'm not exactly sure what that means, but I liked kettle cooked chips, so I assume it's some type of frying. The BLT is as good as they come.\n\nThe malts, there are so many to pick, but I would suggest sharing it, don't try and be a hero, very rich, so keep up with the water as well.\n\nThere will probably be a line, so plan ahead, but enjoy a rel St. Louis classic.",

  "text": "These guys are pretty new, but already I am seriously loving this place.  It is a real gem of a coffee shop, and has serious charm, not to mention dynamite beverages.\n\nThey have an entrance through their building on Arlington, but the main cafe is actually located on Roff Way, which is almost more of a back alley, to be honest.  Now, when I say they are located in a tiny storefront, I mean just that.  Like, my office is bigger than their whole shop.  Walk right in, there is the counter on one side, a few stools along the street-side window, and some nice, simple decorations on the wall.  Simple, compact, and no-nonsense.\n\nThey roast their own beans, which come in several varieties in many levels of darkness, caffeine, and flavor profiles.  What really impresses me is that they individually grind the beans for YOUR own beverage, and then do a pour-over method with a neat contraption built into the counter.  I was also impressed with how quickly they have this down, as until now I've been accustomed to pour-over taking quite a bit longer to get a cup o' joe.  Most of their menu is standard coffee, intended to show off the different characters of the beans.  However, you will also find a scant few mixed cafe drinks as well.  I tried the Bullet Proof, which I found phenomenal!  In addition to very nice coffee, it includes ghee, MCT oil, and brown sugar, all frothed in a blender to give a very rich, not overly sweet, and amazingly energizing brew.  Very unique and inventive concoction, to be sure.\n\nTo round things out, there are a few bottles of iced teas and mineral water available, but also be aware that it does not appear as if they serve any food or snacks here.  You can also buy bags of their coffee, whole bean or ground, and enjoy their product at home.  Price-wise you are looking at maybe $5 or so for the mixed drinks, and a buck or two less for regular coffee.  So a bit pricey for individual cups, but you get amazing quality.\n\nService here was exceptionally friendly and helpful, and as stated above, very prompt in how they make this style of coffee.  They are pretty easy to find, even for how they are sort of tucked out of the way.  There is plenty of street parking in the surrounding neighborhoods, and you could easily walk over from anywhere in the Riverwalk district.  And outside, they have a really lovely seating area that I look forward to enjoying during the warmer months.\n\nAll in all, Reno Coffee Company is a sort of place I wish more coffee shops were like.  They have their craft down, and want nothing to detract from that.  I think this chic, tiny space is really cool, and will certainly be stopping by again whenever I'm down by the river.  Cheers!",

  "text": "When I heard the name \"Interstate Draft House,\" I thought it was going to be some behemoth-sized bar with a ton of beer options. I couldn't have been more wrong. Interstate is about the size of someone's apartment, and they offer about sixteen drafts. It was like stepping into any laid-back neighborhood bar, and that was just fine with me. \n\nMy cousin, his gf, and I got there for happy hour. It wasn't terribly busy, we were seated right away, and our server was very nice. Happy hour, she explained, meant we could choose some bar snacks at about $3-4 and drafts on the board with a star were only $3. Yes, that's right: THREE DOLLARS FOR A CRAFT BEER DRAFT. Not everything was on special, but even the Rogue Chipotle (which is usually double the price) was included. We each went with different drafts: Dogfish Aprihop, Prism Shady Blond (a very local brew), and Bell's Oberon. \n\nWe ordered beers and food. My cousin ordered the chicken tacos, his gf got the spinach-tomato pizza, and I went with the ancho honey wings. The chicken tacos, though just $2 each, came one per order, so he had to put in another order for a second. The spinach-tomato pie was the perfect personal size and the crust was super thin. It looked a little like a frozen pie, but I couldn't confirm that. My wings didn't have as much of an ancho flavor as I would have liked and weren't spicy. But there were six of them, they were on the larger side, and also came with some carrots/celery/ranch, so for $4 it was a great deal. \n\nGranted, it wasn't very busy, but our server never forgot about us and was ready to bring refills when we needed them. \n\nAll in all, Interstate was a solid pick. I would like to come back and take more advantage of the super-cheap drafts on a day when we aren't busting our asses to get back home before a hockey game. They have two TVs at Interstate, but if you don't get a seat at the bar, you won't be able to see them.\n\n*Also, I'm not familiar with the Philly mass transit so I can't comment on that, but we drove over to save some time and parking was super easy. We actually got a spot right in front of the bar.",

  "text": "Mugoo's Diner is located off US19 in Hudson. The building isn't much to look at but the food is familiar and overall fairly good. You know what you're going to get at Muggo's, nothing creative or fancy, just home cooked meals. We met some locals here for lunch/brunch one Saturday. The place had a decent crowd for such an odd hour. The menu was straight forward, sandwiches, salads and your typical breakfast fare. \n\nI had the turkey bacon club which was fine, nothing special but not bad either. My hubby got the cheese steak but the bread was so scorched he had to saw part it off before eating the sandwich. Service was just OK, not overly friendly or attentive. We sat chatting for a while and once my water was empty it stayed that way. I must say that if you eat here you will be getting a bargain. 5 people ate for under $30!!! For that price it wouldn't hurt to come back and give it another shot. \n\nPS- The owner looks just like Mr. Mugoo, whose mug is painted on the outside of the building! *see picture",

There aren't a ton of light options on the menu so be prepared to indulge if you go! \n\nDespite the temptation to head across the street to La Colombe after breakfast we enjoyed the coffee here  instead which is their personal blend from a coffee roaster in NY.   \n\nIf I could I would give this a 3.7 because I think more menu options are needed however the food was good!",

I had heard good things and they had available reservations on OpenTable (always a plus!)\n\nThe interior of the restaurant is beautiful - we sat in the plant-filled entryway, which was beautiful and airy.\n\nWe weren't super hungry, so we decided to share a few different plates:\n\n- Chicken Liver Crostini\n- Red & Yellow Beet Salad\n- Smoked Octopus Pizza\n\nOverall, everything was delicious. I think we liked the Beet salad and Octopus Pizza best. The salad was nice and refreshing. The pumpkin seeds added a great crunch. The pizza was terrific as well - had the nice smoky meatiness from the octopus and the added crunch from the almonds and al dente broccolini.\n\nI definitely want to come back and check out some of the other pizzas and some of the larger plates.",

I think the skin is slightly thinner, which is a good thing in my opinion. \n\nWe also ordered scallion pancakes, beef scallion pancakes, braised minced pork over rice, and watercress. They were all very tasty, though the watercress may have been out of season. The braised minced pork lived up to my memory of the dish, and the beef scallion pancakes were a hit as well. We were very full! \n\nThe atmosphere is clean, new, and nice. It was nice there was no wait but it wasn't empty.",

  "text": "We had tried another of the coffee places in Santa Barbara the day before and it wasn't bad. But husband wanted to try the other place on my list (Handlebar - because yes, I made a list of coffee places ahead of time. We live in Seattle, after all, coffee is kind of a thing) we decided to try it and wound up liking Handlebar SO much more. \n\nConfession: When I first saw the name \"handlebar\" weeks before our trip, it wasn't until we walked into the place and I saw bikes hanging on the wall. I thought, \"Why do they have bikes in here?\" and then *face palm* Ooooooooh.... BIKE handlebars. Dork that I am, *I* somehow got it into my head that there was some sort of western theme and thought it was something to do with mustaches. Yeah. (Like, handlebar mustache? It could happen. Coffee places like to be clever.)  Husband was thrilled - he loves bicycling so this was right up his alley. \n\n(Another side note: this is where we realized how big the casual/commuter bicycling scene is in Santa Barbara. There were so many bikes parked outside, husband loved it. I am not a cyclist but I appreciated the laidback, fun vibe as opposed to all the competitive, holier-than-thou bike scene here in the Seattle area. BUT I DIGRESS.)\n\nHandlebar Coffee! We liked it so much we went back a couple of times. The place had great atmosphere and was unassuming - it wasn't right smack in the middle of downtown so it was a little quieter though still busy. Nice, simple outdoor seating area. I dig the scene here. The staff was nice and the small selection of pastries they had was good. Husband got a drip and I got a latte, both excellent. We love SB and plan on going back as often as we can - Handlebar will be our go-to coffee place every time.",

Decent selection of beer and $1 off drafts during their 5-7 happy hour (I also appreciated the fact that at 7:01 our server still graciously gave us the deal).\n\nBut...WHERE IN GOD'S NAME DID THE MAC & CHEESE GO?! I heard so much about its cheesy goodness and then it just...disappeared. Not cool.\n\nMac if you're reading this, you should bring it back, and you should bring it back now. I beg you.\n\nGravy fries were just okay (although I tried the original - I'd go with Mac's House version next time). I did, however, enjoy the Spicy Sunny Corn which left a slight lip tingling sensation grace à la chipotle seasoning.\n\nIt's clear that Always Sunny is the draw of this place - worth checking out but probably just to grab some beers. This place also seemed to be completely male-dominated, not sure why.",

  "text": "Wanting to take a trip into your stylish, but quirky, cocktail-loving, politically incorrect Grandmother's closet?  Then visit Old Made Good!  \n\nWarning: If you don't enjoy thrifting or vintage pieces, you won't understand the awesome-ness of this gem.  If you like the mass production of over-priced pieces from Green Hills mall, it's best that you continue to fight that traffic......\n\nBUT if you're looking for eccentric, out of the ordinary pieces... From men's and women's clothing, jewelry, accessories to home decor and random treasures and trinkets, this place has it all!  Be prepared to want everything!  \n\nWhat you have to look forward to:\n1. The Otis James line... If you don't know about Peter Napoli or Imogene + Willie, then you don't know about Otis James... Google n.o.w. \n\n2. Not your local craft fair jewelry... There ain't no hand-knitted crap here.  And your necklace isn't made out of Hobby Lobby fishing line. \n\n3. Politically incorrect home decor... These ladies' humor is evident in their pieces.  Upon finding things that really don't have much value as is, they spice them up with off center musings.  I.e. A 1980's mis-matched china plate is coined with \"Hey Hussy.\"  An old, unimpressive painting is marked with glitter letters saying \" Do EPIC Shit.\" You get the picture....\n\n4. Stellar thrifting finds, ranging from furs and 1970's cowboots to a Catholic Last Rites Box... If you love spending hours looking for that perfect treasure at local thrift stores, flea markets, or estate sales but don't have time to peruse every nook and cranny, head to Old Made Good!  They collect the best thrifting finds and offer them to you... One of their cardinal rules: When they come across an item whose ownership is proclaimed (i.e. a name is embroidered on the inside of a vintage fur), they buy it.  No questions.  Their philosophy: it's karma. \n\n5. Chelsea Ray.  This chick is a Badass. Seamstress.  \n\nShe takes men's shirts and tailors them to fit women.  If you don't see a pattern that you like in the store, you can bring in a shirt of yours (or your lover's - awesome!) and she'll work her magic... If you've been looking for the perfect laid back, button-up to wear over leggings or jeans, but have reservations about showing off your lady lump in leggings that aren't as thick as they should be, these shirts are for you!  They are long enough to cover your dairy aire, but yet are fitted to your curves... \"Fit like a glove\" sums it up! Seriously, the Fiance (who doesn't give out free compliments) just stared with his mouth wide open saying \"Wow.\"  And then we went to dinner and not once did I question whether my rear was in plain view.  This was the best $36 bucks spent... And now the Fiance's retired, Goodwill bound shirts have a new purpose in the closet!  \n\nThis little lady also takes your momma's awful 1990's floor length skirts and turns them into fitted fish-tail skirts that look perfect with boots (or 4 inch heels!)... They are similar to an inverted mullet: party in the front (shorty short) and business in the back (to your calf coverage).   \n\n6. The ladies' air of \"we know we have great shit.\"  If you enjoy sales ladies following you around, complimenting your attire and doting over you, you need not go.  There is no need for these ladies to push a sale on you... Rather, you're resisting the urge to buy everything because you have effectively justified purchasing several car loads worth of prizes and are now onto contemplating how you're going to tell the Fiance that the 1980's school-house desk with the words \"We Don't Need No Education\" will look down right perfect in the foyer...\n\nIn closing, GO. NOW.  I think I missed several things, so I'm planning a return trip next week.......",

Parking is street parking so don't expect to find parking right next to the place, but there is parking up the street. \n\nOur waiter was amazing, he was really nice and gave up time expectations on our pizza, which was very considerate of him. We had the pretzel appetizer, and the homemade pretzel sticks were soooooo good. The cheese sauce wasn't that great with the pretzel. I wished it was like Auntie Annie's spicy cheese sauce.... but the pretzel alone was yummy and I will definitely order it again.\n\nWe ordered the thin crust pepperoni and sausage pizza. It was a really good pizza for Tennessee. Did it taste like things crust pizzas  I've had in Chicago...which I've had many many times by the way... no its didn't. It wasn't in any way in comparison to the greatness that I've had there, however it's still a pretty yummy pizza. I do think the pepperoni was cut to thick.\n\nThe next time I go I will try the deep dish. I've had it once when I was a kid in Chicago and thought it was really really good...then I was scarred when Pizza Hut came out with a deep dish and I was in Chicago and my dad's best friend wanted to try it and ordered it, and it was horrible.... so I haven't tried any deep dish pizzas since... but I will go back to 312 here in the next couple of weeks and give it a try, because of the reviews on yelp about 312 deep dish.",

Which sucks, because being sexy does not come as naturally as the dirt under my nails. Buuuut the reason why I love this place is because of the Yards Brawler. Before Yards Brawler I was doing shameful things like ordering Snakebite and Bloody Ho's (beers mixed with framboise) and getting MOCKED for it. Now, The Brawler is my go-to order. My friend and I got the sampler pack a couple of years ago when we were young and experimental and it's like finding your favorite pair of jeans that never stretch out. You feel comfortable ordering it and people don't mock you-- in fact they mistake you for liking beer and being the cool down to earth beer chick.\n\nAlso this review is for the COMPANY which rocks a solid A in my books.

They come through with serious flavor and quality in their food. My party of 4 ordered the Smokehouse Hash, Loaded Hash, French Toast, and I tried the Farmhouse Specialty. Everyone was happy with their food. The Farmhouse was a grilled biscuit (crunchy and a little tart- really good!), sausage patty, cheddar cheese, eggs and gravy. The gravy was the perfect thickness and saltiness. The house potatoes were also pretty good. \n\nI think this is the best breakfast I've had in the treasure valley. Very impressed with their food!",

Now that they have been open almost 6 months, you would think they would have figured out how to efficiently handle the queue of customers near the register. Unfortunately they haven't. People still mill about wondering where you order. Do you order food from the employee behind the baked goods counter, or the one starting off into space near the pour-overs? Do you order food and coffee at the same time? And where? At the register? Still not clear after all this time. Also it is a crapshoot that they will even have food when you get there. Officially the kitchen closes at 4PM, but I have gone there as early as 1PM and told they were out of ham and butter as well as chicken salad. Come on! It's still lunchtime.

I've always had good experiences there, so when my car had a flat tire and the Brentwood location was closest, I thought I could trust them as much as I've been able to trust the other location. \n\nWrong.\n\nNot only did I have to wait more than two hours (and fair enough, it was the last of the month and I had no appointment as it was an emergency), but they also failed to accurately diagnose and fix the problem. That said, they somehow had time (and the audacity) to look for and talk me into other \"fixes.\"\n\nAs soon as I paid for the new tire and other \"needed\" repairs and left, my tire pressure light came back on. I pulled back in and asked the employees if that was normal and to please double-check the work. I was told \"don't worry about it; you'll have to drive about 50 miles for the sensor to reset\" in a condescending tone that made it clear how little that guy respected me.\n\nAnd so off I drove, still trusting these people.\n\nThe next day, I drove to work. So far, so good. Then, an hour or so into my workday, security alerted me that I had a flat tire. Again. The same one.\n\nI called the Brentwood Dobbs back and, to their credit, they did pay for towing and fix the tire for free. But it shouldn't have happened. I trusted them to actually bother to look at the wheel and tire (and again, this despite finding the time to identify other alleged problems they could charge me for), and I brought it back as soon as the light came on again.\n\nI am deeply disappointed in the unethical, unprofessional work done at this location. I will never be back, and this fiasco may have cost the Dobbs location I've patronized for 15 years my business.",

It's just so fresh, delicious, and guilt free. \n\nOne day I passed by and saw a loooong drive through line and decided to jump on the band wagon. \n\nI was surprised at how fast they were handling business. Pretty impressive being that they just opened. On top of that, every worker I've encountered has been nothing but nice and well informed. \n\nMy favorite sandwich is the #2  spicy deluxe sandwich with Chick fil A sauce. It's so spicy, but in a good way. Eating the juicy spicy chicken patty along with the buns, cheese, tomato, lettuce and sauce is just the best. Everything is incredibly well balanced. \nI mistakenly ordered the regular spicy chicken sandwich without cheese, lettuce and tomato one day and it wasn't nearly as good. \n\nI was surprised at how fresh the chicken was. I could see the moisture after taking a bite out of it, just as when I cook chicken at home fresh from the market.\n\nChick fil A must have the healthiest, tastiest and smartest kid's meals on the planet. The nuggets are fresh and delicious just like their sandwiches. For sides they have great options- applesauce or a fresh fruit cup. Their fruit cup was legit. It had mandarin oranges, blueberries, strawberries and apples and everything was so fresh. I also love their drink options-milk or organic juice. To top things off, they include a fun educational toy such as I spy booklets or pop out assemble yourself animals. Doesn't get any better than that. Finally a fast food place this mom approves of. \n\nDid I mention that they have the best milk shakes ever? I never order milk shakes but they turned me around all right. Seems like they use real ice cream and fresh milk. Their Oreo and vanilla milk shakes are so delicious and refreshing. They use fresh crunchy cookies and  actual vanilla flavor. The thickness and cool mouth feel is just right too. They top them off with whipped cream and a maraschino cherry. \n\nTry all of their sauces!!!! Sooooooo good. The combinations are endless. I like the Chick fil A sauce the most but also like combining the ranch with the zesty buffalo.\n\nI've been here more times than I can count because I'm truly addicted. I talked to many workers at every location I go to and all of them swear by Chick fil A, eating here while they're working and even when they're off the clock. That says a lot.",

The cashiers were cordial, but problems with the order either fell upon the cashiers taking the order incorrectly or staff making food improperly. \n\nI had multiple people in my party order everything from pizza to sandwiches to the wings and nothing was up to par. We were asked what sauce we wanted on the wings, but when the \"wings\" were served, they gave no sauce. When we asked them to fix it, we were given a dipping cup.\n\nThe sandwich was properly made, but it was somewhat undercooked and fell apart after the first bite. That could be the mark of a juicy sandwich, but in this case it was just shoddily put together.\n\nThe pizza itself was passable, but not terribly great for a namesake dish. The one silver lining had to be the drink machine, which really shouldn't ever be a silver lining for any situation.\n\nThe rest of the atmosphere was fine, if a little strange. There were an abundance of large TVs, but you would think at least one of them would be in Full HD (they aren't). The sliding glass door is always open, but I'm not sure why it was needed to begin with.\n\nI don't know, it just seems like this whole restaurant just won't be worth most people's time. Yes, it really is that bad. Yes, you will probably regret it. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but that's the way Dan cooks his pizza.",

Such a nice place inside - yet the weather was unbelievable & here where it can get hotter than hades 3/4 of the year, you have to take advatage of this weather whenever it comes!!\n\nOur waitress - super sweet & helpful as we were obvious newbies - showed us the drink menu explaining the juice bar - I decided to try the GInger Hopper ... YUM!!! that had a good kick to it (that was the ginger of course! SO VERY GOOD!!) & my honey got The Champ - very good too but no kick (no ginger duh!) :-)  - I dug them both!!\n\nI got the Spanish Breakfast & my honey got the Huevos Rancheros - very good!! The back beans had a nice flavor to them - not plain but not overly spicey.\n\nCan I tell you... I want more of that juice!!! mmmm!!!\n\n4/9 - went back a week later (I have been craving that Ginger Hopper all week!!) & this time I got teh creamy oatmeal w/ carmalized apples OHMYGOSH!!! SOOOOOO GOOD!!! I also got a fruit bowl which I wans't abel to finish becasue the oatmeal was so very filling - sooo good!!!  Weather is still perfect enough to eat outside w/ a nice breeze & that GInger Hopper - I am addicted!!\n\nMy honey got a burrito w/ a side of creamy grits & really enjoyed those grits! He also had the apple spice juice & really dug that too!\nyum!!",

  "text": "A++. Beyond great. First, amazing customer service, and second, amazing service.\n\nWe had an appt for Victor to do a dishwasher install, but Sears did not deliver the washer on the day they were supposed to, which forced me to put our appt on hold with Victor. He was extremely gracious about it, and when our dishwasher arrived, I called Victor to schedule an appt and he came out next day. Fantastic!\n\nThe dishwasher install itself was absolutely crazy. Victor went Macgyver and fixed an incredibly difficult problem. Long story short, the previous owner of our house had installed their dishwasher horribly with atypical tubing/wiring/setup (which other contractors had commented on, previously), so a customized job was required for this intall. In order for our install to happen, the space for the dishwasher had to be resized... it was just slightly too small for the dishwasher we ordered. Most installers at this point would probably say \"We can't do this job\" and try to charge anyway for the housecall, but Victor simply told me what would need to happen in order to get it done, and then he went to work. We had to get out my table saw, jigsaw, drill, and hammer and chisel, by the time we were done. That's not all. Normally the tubing can be hooked up before the washer is put into its space, but the tubing for this setup was so short that the dishwasher had to be pushed into its space before all the tubing could be hooked up. Again, another spot where most installers would say not doable, but VIctor somehow hooked this thing all up with a few crammed inches of space between the floor and bottom of dishwasher to work with. \n\nVictor went way beyond what he agreed to come out for, and basically figured out what needed to get done in order to get our dishwasher going. He made it happen. Had I hired anyone else, I'd be willing to bet my bottom dollar that they would've at some point during the install said they hit an impasse, most likely that I needed a plumber to resize the piping line.\n\nThank you Victor! You're the man! You literally improved our quality of life by helping us get this done so we can get back to our lives. \n\nYelpers, use this man!!! He is extremely resourceful, nice, and honest and fair in billing. You're not going to find anyone better, you can be sure of that.",

  "text": "Because there was ingenuity behind the plates, I wanted to like the food more but the end result left me puzzled.\n\nThe crawfish hushpuppies were a good idea because they are two wonderful ingredients, but where was the crawfish? The key ingredient was lost and further buried by the overly dark deep frying.\n\nCombining frog legs and bacon with a spicy kick from horseradish and creole remoulade was a good idea, but what's the point of serving frog legs if you're just going to make them taste like chicken. Where is the amphibious funk? Also, be careful while eating because of the bones.\n\nFried pork rinds that popped and crackled when served was a good idea. It sounded great, but tasted like Styrofoam.\n\nTransforming grits into a white cheddar grit cake as a base for the shrimp was a good idea, but why make the exterior skin so thick? Why drown the shrimp and grits in a \"Creole BBQ cream sauce\" that neither tasted Creole nor BBQ? Why use small, flavorless shrimp? To make things worse, the side of southern greens was harshly home-styled to the point they were difficult to eat.\n\nSoaking pasta in alcohol for the \"Drunken Angel\" was a good idea, but why use cheap red wine? The wine wasn't going to cook down. Why use saffron? Saffron is one of the most expensive ingredients in the world. It's something chefs don't waste in a spicy arrabbiata-like sauce that was filled with garlic to the point where the saffron was hardly noticeable. Why put so much bread (a waitress mockingly called it a \"loaf\") on top of the pasta bowl? Not only was it carbs on more carbs, it was flavored like something from the disgusting Olive Garden (which doesn't realize that olives grow on trees in groves, not in gardens). Granted, there was good flavor from the crawfish and lobster broth, but why use so much cream sauce, again? And to top it all off, the pasta was overcooked and mushy.\n\nGastropubs frequently have smaller food items or \"bites\". No need to worry about not getting enough food here. The plates are plenty big so you don't \"parish\". Basically, don't order more than two plates per person.\n\nDespite the repeated use of ginger ale, mint, and cucumber infused liquors when cucumbers aren't in season, the best thing about The Parish was the cocktails and the main thing saving the place from 2-stars. The Caribbean Mule was clearly the top drink of the night with its cold brightness.\n\nTucson is a town so small they get confused when I give a phone number. They don't expect the area code or The Parish doesn't expect many out-of-towners. The clientele also seemed confused where silly parents celebrate their infant's birthday with the baby in tow. Who does that? This is a gastropub, not a Chuck E. Cheese. Service was not properly coordinated between staff members.",

I can't even explain, you just gotta go see it to believe me lol. \n\nSo we started off with a few beers/well cocktails. And we ended up playing some pool, and then ended up playing a couple rounds of beer pong. Then my husband and our other friend started playing flip cup with the bartender, and it's going to kill me that I cannot remember name! But she was super fun! * the bartender won the flip cup LOL* and they both had to spin the wheel on the wall, hilarioussss!\n\nAfter awhile, she gave us some shots that were called green tea shots? I was super hesitant to take them, I don't do shots like that. And surprisingly it legit tasted like green tea! Then the bartender told me to get on the bar, kind of freaked me out a bit lol. I ended up doing my first body shot! Eek. Was super terrified! But I'm hella ticklish so the liquor kind of went everywhere lol.. oops! After that me, my two girlfriends and another girl ended up on the bar doing BJ shots. My god. It was just a wild time!\n\nDef a new type of bar experience for me and I liked it! If you want to have fun without burning your pockets then go here! It's def a good time and youll def leave feeling amazing!",

After hitting several places, we decided to cross the street to Jason Aldean's Rooftop.  \n\nI give the place a 3 star just for the lively ambiance in the place and the fabulous Rooftop bar. The place was very busy.  Music video playing was loud but really good.   BUT..... it stops there.  The drinks were CRAZY expensive.  We ordered a Vodka & Tonic, and a plain, regular Diet Coke...... $18.00 bucks.  Not sure if I mistakenly ordered a tall or what.  I am sure I didn't.   Then, we went up to the rooftop.... the view was fabulous.  My husband ordered a Captain Spiced Rum and Diet Coke, and I ordered a club soda w/ lime.  Again,the bill came in at $17.00 bucks.

We picked a spot by the window. We immediately received menus and our drink order was taken. Tea for me, Vietnamese coffee for hubby. Our order was taken very quickly, and drinks arrived soon after.\n\nWe got an order of 4 spring rolls to share, decent flavour, but curious that there was no chilli garlic sauce on the table. We made do with sriracha and chilli oil. No biggie.\n\nHubby ordered the pork & spring roll vermicelli bowl. Also curious was the fact that the noodles were served warm in this dish, as they've been served cold every other time he's ordered this dish elsewhere. Don't get me wrong, this wasn't a bad thing, the warm noodles actually elevated the flavours in this dish. The grilled pork was excellent as well. Yum!\n\nI ordered a regular P1 w/no tripe and extra tendon. The soup was good, flavourful broth, tasty meatballs...but I did not receive the extra tendon I asked for (I have no problem paying extra for this if required). There were 3 tasty, but small pieces in there. One other thing, the noodles seemed to be freshly cooked rather that pre-cooked and added after. A small but nice touch. \n\nOnce our food arrived, we had no other interaction with any staff other than when we got up to pay. No one asked how our meal was, no one brought us the bill. Almost like we were a nuisance, bordering on feeling like we'd been dismissed. Ok, so no warm fuzzies here. \n\nGood food, hot soup, chilly service.",

  "text": "This hotel hosts a pool tournament for our local league.  When I called to make my reservation the woman that I spoke with said that she was sorry but she was going to have to \"break my heart\" because they had no rooms left.  I told her thank you and got on Priceline to look for another hotel.  While searching I came across this hotel with rooms available but at a much higher price.  I booked it hoping that when I got to the hotel they would give me the advertised rate but when I arrived the price was actually higher!  On Saturday night they charged my $324 per night for a 3 star rated hotel with poor service, mediocre cleanliness, and limited access to food or drink.  They had posted security at the entrances of the tournament to make sure people were not bringing in there own food or drinks so we had to pay for theirs.",

I decided to settle with The Voom Room after stopping in to get an estimate. They ladies were very friendly, welcoming, and informative when I stopped in.\n\nI arrived yesterday about a half hour before my appointment. Rebecca took me right away and asked me what I was looking for and wanting. This was the first time I was dying my hair let alone letting a new stylist dye it. I was very nervous but Rebecca was confident and professional which made me feel comfortable. I had shown her photos of what I was wanting and got perfect results.\n\nGreat atmosphere and cute salon! I'll definitely schedule another appointment when I want to change it up!",

  "text": "This was my wife's and my second ghost tour.  The other (by another company) was much better.  The problem was the guide...a guy named DJ.  He should have been telling stories but he kept going all over the place with extraneous information.\n\nWorst of all, he had that kind of millennial false virtue that you see so much of.  He bad mouthed the Catholic church.  Now, we all know that the Catholic Church has a varied and sometimes awful past.  But did he have to make his first comment on this church be about child molestation? BTW - I am not Catholic.\n\nHe liked talking about racism...lots of millennials do.  It gives them a chance to show off their virtue.  Talking about slavery in a historical context is just part of New Orleans and was bound to come up.  But he went off the rails.  There was a mixed race couple in our group and DJ managed to make the woman defensive.\n\nThe guide makes these tours.  DJ obviously thinks he is a great guide.  I disagree.  He is the first tour guide I've ever stiffed.  I'm usually a generous tipper.  Our group of four just dropped out of the tour before it was over.\n\nSo...DJ...maybe it's time (you being an adult male in your thirties) to find an actual career and get on with your life.  You are too old to be doing this and not good enough at it to be an asset to your company.",

  "text": "Sad. Prep & Pastry started out fabulous, but the last two times I've been there, the pork and turkey sausages were under-cooked, potatoes tasted more of old olive oil and the center of the biscuits--cold. And the redone seating was not thought through. Large table placed in a large alcove that doubles as a \"bandshell\" for table talk which gets inadvertently amplified out into the restaurant making it almost impossible to hear your table mates or the waiter. Two seater tables placed so close to each other that the waiter has to assume the child's pose to service either table.  And lastly, being told that payments take place at the table after waiting in line at the cash register-- which I guess is just part of the decor--not a place to make payment for food? Ah well. It was nice while it lasted.",

  "text": "This new Tunisian-based BYO is a complete makeover of the Thai operation formerly here. The new decor is awash in soft, light blue (what else?) executed with exceptional taste. The overall effect is delightfully romantic, especially for Doylestown, which can use something \"date night\" like this even though the mellow vibe was diminished by a bright sconce light over our table.\n\nThe owners are obviously anxious to please, and could hardly do more to make folks feel welcome. We were warmly greeted, well taken care of throughout, and even given a complimentary after-dinner degustation.\n\nOur appetizers -- octopus and a meatball special -- were absolutely spectacular, fully worthy of a great restaurant. The latter was spicy in the best sense, with heat used to enhance flavor using a delectable mix of herbs and spices from the owner's mother in Tunisia.\n\nWere the meal to end there, Blu would qualify for a major detour and a solid five stars. Alas, the warhorse mains -- lamb couscous and moussaka -- were ordinare, albeit using superior quality lamb and other ingredients. Couscous was too dry and lacking in flavor complexity, while moussaka came off as little more than pleasant comfort food. If you want worthy moussaka hereabouts, try someplace like Philly's Estia.\n\nThe dessert of superior baklava and dates fared much better except for tiny portion size. If you're more than a nibbler, you're better off walking down the block to excellent Nina's or even Nonno's.\n\nThe owner has had long experience as a chef, and given the investment he's made appears to be playing it safe and predictable with menu offerings. Yet, he obviously has talent worthy of much greater things, so in time the main courses may expand to approach the quality and creativity of the apps we enjoyed. In the meantime, best bet is probably to steer clear of predictable menu choices and spring instead for the specials.\n\nWorth mentioning is how clean this place is, and not only to the eye. We noticed that when a table was cleared off where a family with children had been, the floor area around that table was also wiped down.\n\nWe got out for under $45/person, plus tip and wine.",

And I don't even live in the city!\n\nI am so excited that there is an establishment in Philly that is a cross between In-N-Out and Bobby's Burger Palace for Vegans! But you really do not have to be Vegan to love the food.\n\nHere's what I have tried so far:\n\nUdon Noodle Salad: Classic tasty Asian salad with Vegan chicken. Really nice taste if a bit overdressed.\n\nCurry Tofu Wrap: I had this for lunch the day after I bought it. Still was delicious. I'm surprised there was such a great Indian taste on this menu. \n\nZiggy Burger: Get this! And order extra special sauce. My new favorite burger!\n\nCrispy HipCity Ranch: Good Italian \"chicken\" sandwich. Not as awesome as the Ziggy.\n\nSweet Potato Fries with cilantro black bean dip: my new favorite Philly fries. Sorry European Republic! Still love you but this great dip is Vegan!\n\nMy wife and I have also had the chocolate chip cookies which are quite good.\n\nOne negative: they have no customer bathroom. According to the very friendly people at the counter it is because they are not zoned for one.\n\nPhilly's Veg/Vegan scene was struggling compared to New York's. Thank goodness HipCity Veg opened to help close the gap.",
