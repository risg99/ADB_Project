I called when I noticed it was already 12:15pm only to be told that they were short a driver and the food would go out when he got back. Ok, I can understand that. However, I don't understand the fact that no one gave me a call to let me know. Instead, the manager told me I should've called the order in not placed it online??? Really! Okay, I wasn't too happy, But it was worst when I received the order and was told that there was no soup because they didn't have it. I was pissed off at that point. I called back only to have the manager not really sound like he cared. He did ask me if there was anything he could do, but all I said was that the communication was seriously lacking. They still charged me and did nothing to keep my business. I am always ordering for my office, however, I will not use Earl ever again.",

The service was some of the worst I've ever had. We sat for 20 minutes before we even got water. WATER! I came here for a work lunch, I don't have 20 minutes to wait on water. The server was extremely kind at first until we asked another server for water after 20 minutes, then she got sassy. We ordered drinks and food that didn't show up and when we asked for them she said her boss had questions. If he had questions then ask them! Don't make me ask where the food is for you to finally tell me you have questions about my order. Which her questions were around what we ordered, great fun! I'll only get to go next time, the service is just horrible.",

(I was up at midnight for a dew days two months out to get one.. 'spoiler')\n\nMet up with the Mrs. and some friends for an evening of food and drink and we were not disappointed.\n\nGreeted with the standard house made pickles of celery, carrots and jerusalem artichokes, we all agreed that the chef's tasting was the only way for us.\n\nThe salatim (salads of the day) lined our table with beets, cabbage, eggplant, carrots, fennel and cauliflower were front and center, each prepared to bring out the purest flavor of that ingredient, lightly flavored and much better to share. \n\nThe signature hummus arrived, but this time donning some roasted cauliflower and their ever so fluffy pita.  When you need, and want, more just ask.  You want it.\n\nSmaller dishes throught the night included grilled duck hearts, haloumi cheese, fried cauliflower, a crispy mushroom dish, brussels sprouts, and a ceviche made its way to our table.  All hits, no misses.\n\nThe piece de resistance arrived with smokey sweet lamb (brined, smoked and braised, a multi day procedure) and a dish I've been wanting to share was superb, better in fact, if at all possible than our first trip. Garnished with chickpeas and accompanied by that crispy Persian rice, rich with spices and the alluring crack one you've broken the shell.  It's definitely one of the best parts of the meal.\n\nBrandishing out now growing stomachs, dessert!  Pumpkin kanofi (rich and sweet), apple sorbet (tart and refreshing), pistachicio upside down cake (well balanced and pleasantly pistachio flavored.. , and my personal favorite, the malabi custard (think panna cotta-flan hybrid flavored with rose.\n\nAnother truly epic meal and one that everyone should try to get a chance to experience.\n\n*the wine pairing was well received with a few unique ones that went well with each round of food.",

It took me back to my dorm days which is not a good thing.\n\n2. The hotel is basically on top of train tracks - and the train runs ALL night. The horn is incredibly loud and hard to sleep through - even for a deep sleeper like myself.\n\n3. They lost our reservation... even though we showed them the confirmation email. They then tried to charge us a higher rate then was shown on the confirmation email.\n\n4. The bathroom has the worst shower I think I've ever seen in a hotel room. You could literally sit on the toliet and take a shower... there is about four square feet of shower space, and the shower head is on a wall three feet in front of the toilet - with only flimsy shower curtains cordoning off the area. Water from the shower covers the floor, there's no way to prevent it.\n\nDon't stay here!",

  "text": "Not sure who to contact about this, but this station stole money from me this afternoon. I went in and paid $10, prepay for gas. When I went to fill up, the pump told me to pay the cashier. Went back to tell the attendant that the pump wasn't working and she said it was because I had put the handle back down, and it would pay the money back to my card. I had to pay again. I tried to explain that it did it from the beginning, which was why I was telling her. She copped SERIOUS attitude, and said too bad you have to pay again. So I paid at the pump. I went in to get my receipt for my pay at the pump, and she said to expect 2 charges cause I over filled my tank. Um, no maam. I showed her, on the receipt where she had originally charged the wrong pump, and I asked her to reverse it. She said she couldnt do that, and tried to rip the receipts out of my hand. And then said good luck getting your money back. I've never had this kind of experience anywhere. Called my bank and put a stop payment on the charge, but you guys really need to do something. Seeing as other reviews have also had this happen to other people per google, I strongly suggest going to the shell a couple of blocks down unless you just want to get stolen from.   I will happily provide photos of my receipts.",

I finally left when Fox & Friends was playing on the tv when I walked in. \n\nWhat a difference a haircut at JAG's makes! This is a seriously great barbershop. Casual, yet all about getting down to business. I was amazed at and very happy with how quiet it was. Not because business was slow. Business was brisk with 8 chairs filled the entire time I was there. It was quiet because the barbers here are pros concentrating on their work. Truly good barbers don't need to chew your ear off, thank you.\n\nI booked an appointment with Juan (the owner, I believe) for $2 more than a walk-in wait for one of the other barbers. I didn't see a bad haircut from any of the other barbers walk out of the room while I was there, but I feel like I robbed the place getting a haircut from the man himself. He is way underpriced and way humble. \n\nExcellent!",

I called Audio Itch and they were great, I went in and I really had no idea what I wanted, I wanted it dark but didn't even know that there were levels of heat resistance or anything. I got 15% all the way around and 70% heat resistance and I love it. They walked me around my car because I asked about Paint correction and gave me the whole break down, I will definitely be going back to them for paint correction a ceramic coat and more they have definitely got a life long customer.",

  "text": "Our experience (2of us) at Fellini on Saturday January 12 left a little to be desired. First off, clearly they are one of the most popular restaurants in Media, so the restaurant was packed to the gills. We arrived 10 mins past our reservation, and had to wait another 10 mins to be seated. We were seated in a back corner, in a main traffic area from the kitchen. We were lucky we didn't wind up with plates full of food on our laps several times.  There should have never have been a table in that spot.  Our waitress was pleasant, but we waited 40 minutes for an appetizer that never came.  We were starving and finally our entrees came. The waitress never checked back in until halfway through our entrees were finished, and asked if our appetizer ever came. Then the host came over and apologized about the appetizer and offered it to us for free and we took it home. Overall, the food was good, but the restaurant clearly packs too many people in and overloads the staff.   Based on their reputation we expected better.",

  "text": "I have been wanting to visit Marjie's for months so when my family was in town for Jazz Fest I decided to give it a shot! And I'm so so so happy I did!\n\nFirst of all, Marjie's is located in a shot gun house on Broad Street. There is no parking lot/ easy parking so we parked on a side street and walked over. The restaurant was crazy after Jazz Fest Thursday but we were the luckiest people in the city because we got a table for 4 outside on the back porch. While the inside of the restaurant seemed a little bright/ like someone's home, the back porch was PERFECT for dinner. It is super comfortable and there were string lights which made me feel like I was at a cute little garden party.\n\nOur table for 4 decided to order a bunch of food and share it family style, which I highly recommend! We started with the charred Brussels sprouts (obviously because they're my obsession), which were a little sweet, crunchy, and delicious. We also got the springtime som tam (double spicy)- great fresh veggies, coal roasted sweet potatoes - salty and sweet and oh so good, hush puppies - pretty good but just tasted fried to me, the chili butter yard bird - cooked very well, the herb rubbed gulf fish - great flavor, and the spare ribs - I didn't try them but my family really enjoyed them. All of the food was unique, thought out, and very flavorful. There wasn't one thing that we ordered that I didn't really enjoy, so I know that all of the other menu items are probably amazing as well. And the food was affordable! All of that food plus 2 beers and tip was around $125 - a steal for dinner for 4.\n\nI'm sad that it took me so long to visit Marjie's but I will definitely be back! \n\nFood - 4.5 stars\nPrice - 4.5 stars\nService - 4 stars \nAtmosphere - 3 stars inside, 4.5 stars outside",

In my stable of establishments to patron, this is filed under \"Go to if you're looking to give the impression of a fancy restaurant and food doesn't matter.\n\nNone of the food is bad, per se, but I also cannot think of one dish that has knocked my socks off. The same can be said for the drinks. I ordered a apple cider mule last time I was here and I'm not sure what the problem was, but it wasn't good and that is something that is hard to mess up in my opinion. I also had the filet and the cream of tomato soup. The filet was very tender and good, bit the flavor wasn't great if that makes sense. Finally, the  soup was too thick and salty for my tastes and that is saying a lot considering I love salty food! I hate to give a restaurant an okay review, but okay has just been my opinion of the food here.\n\nPrices seemed decent but close to the more than I would have liked to pay' end considering the service was spotty and the food was mostly average.\n\nOther than that, the ambiance was great for getting dressed up and a romantic dinner. Low lighting, and polite wait staff makes this a great go to for dates if you're trying to impress someone early in your relationship.",

We had the Margherita and the Bianca with roasted onions added.  It was worth the wait.  Apparently the oven can only do 3 pies at a time, but it doesn't take long since they cook at 810 degrees.  Oh, and let's not forget the fresh mozzarella made in house daily.  Thin delicious charred crust so if that's not your bag, move on.  The only suggestion I have is that they should expand the dining area plus add some simple items to the menu so customers could munch on something while waiting for the masterpieces to arrive.  Like salad or provolone & olives or something.  But yeah, bravo!",

The ambiance and service remains the same (good on both counts) but the food has improved. I had a green onion cake that was chewy and delicious, followed by a bowl of brisket pho. The portion was larger than I remembered, extremely hot, and tasted great.

This has lettuce, tomato, onion, fresh basil and oregano, gouda cheese, provolone, smoked ham, pepperoni, salami, italian dressing, topped with a shaved asiago cheese.    This has a great taste.  The choice of cheeses and meats blend well together.  All of the meats and cheeses taste very fresh.  \n\nI would definitely go back.  I however would not go out of my way to eat here again.

  "text": "What a find!  I'm so glad I watched Heat seekers before our NOLA trip and discovered this restaurant.  We made our meal off the appetizer section and were STUFFED.  Here's what we had:\n\nBad Bart's Black Jambalaya - Not at all hot by my standards but really wonderful flavor.  I love the black-eyed peas and the meat was very high quality and tasty.\n\nFried Mac N Cheese - OMG, so GOOD!  This was my favorite dish.  I LOVE the crispiness of the cheese.  It takes a traditional dish to a whole new level.  I'm definitely going to have to try to replicate it at home since I can't just pop down to NOLA anytime I want some Mac N Cheese\n\nTwo pies - We had the meat and seafood pies from the appetizer menu and they were really tasty.  The crust was flaky and tender and perfect.  The fillings were really flavorful.  \n\nFramboise Float - I LOVE good beer and I also love when someone comes up with a clever way to use beer and that's definitely what this is.  The creamy sweetness of the cream cheese ice cream perfectly balanced with the sweet/tart fruitiness of the lambic.  I could see doing something similar with other lambics as well.  I think peach in particular would be GREAT in summer.  \n\nUnfortunately, we were too stuffed to try their pizza or their sausage (other than what was in the jambalaya) and I really regret that.  This will definitely be on my must stop list for my next visit to NOLA.",

Note, the website instructs that appointments are recommended but not required. After being told they were unable to schedule me for an appt at that time, I asked if it would be okay to walk in to see if we could be accommodated as the website says appointments are recommended but not required. On the day of our visit, we were rudely turned away and told we could not be accommodated. A few things were disturbing: 1. I was told it'd be alright to come in w/o an appt. 2. Her attitude, body language and tone were all incredibly mean spirited and aggressive. 3. The bride clearly arrived ready to spend at least $90 and she was not even offered an alternative such as a ready made perfume or whatever else they might have had.\n\nSome of us travelled from as far as DC and the way we were received was very unbecoming of a business which is supposed to cater to clientele in the one of the most celebratory times of their lives.

The area where we sat was dirty - could feel the crumbs on the sofa-like seating and had to dust them off.  Bleh, not a good start.  We ordered from the a la carte menu.  We started with the Casablanca salad which was good, but under-flavored.  We had the chicken tagine and chicken kabobs for entrees.  The chicken tagine was awful.  The seasoning on it was too dense and pungent to eat and the chicken itself was bland and on the dry side.  The kabobs were also bland and dry.  The couscous that accompanied the kabobs was simply awful - bland and tasteless.  \nFor the life of me, I can't understand why a Moroccan restaurant serves pita bread rather than traditional Moroccan bread.  But, even still, the pita was dry and on the harder side, not overwhelmingly fresh.  \nWe did not get dessert.  We did have the Moroccan mint tea, which was good and tasted authentically Moroccan.  \nThe kicker was we weren't able to use the gift certificate for the a la carte menu, only for the \"feasts\".  \nWe won't be using the gift certificate at all because we won't be going back.  \nTo top it off, the belly dancer was not good.",

  "text": "I went to this Cheesecake Factory because I thought it would be a nice change of pace from the Willow Grove location I normally go to. And boy ... was I wrong. It started with the staff who immediately was not friendly. I know they were busy, I understand that but simple niceties would have been appreciated. Then the experience went down hill from there. My friend and I both ordered and my friend was delivered the wrong dish. Okay the waiter comped it but he made it seem as if it was my friend's fault when really the waiter just misheard him apparently. I am sure there are plenty of people who do order something and when they get it say it's not what they ordered (shame on these people) but the waiter clearly misheard him and so when my friend asked what it was, he told him what it was and said that is what he ordered. It was a battle about taking it back, my friend hates wasting and was going to eat it anyway but the waiter offered to swap it (+1) but his tone just seemed very peeved. \"I can swap it but we cook it fresh so it's gonna take awhile\". Okay ... Then my food that I ordered was super liquid-y. I had a dish with a cream sauce and instead of cream it was soup. The sauce didn't even stick to my pasta. It just tastes watery and bland. We had to ask for more bread and drinks , normally we get asked if we want more. And then to top it all off the place, as another yelper had mentioned. It needed a face lift. I realized once my plate was clear that below it was a giant crater from which the entire top surface of the table was removed (the faux marble effect ) to reveal its undersurface - rough and raw. We skipped out on Cheesecake after everything that has gone wrong thus far. And then we left to use the bathroom and there were not even enough bathrooms I waited and waited and had to leave. With a restaurant that huge why do you only have 3 bathrooms? I know that is not the restaurants fault, but it was just another sour note on my first and only poor Cheesecake Factory experience - and I have had a drink spilled on me. Needless to say, I won't be going back!",

  "text": "First off, I want to thank Dr. John Childs for recommending Orthodontic Partners.  I am in my fifties. The thought of getting Invisalign seemed kind of silly. I met with Jessica Coltra, treatment coordinator, and she went over options.  If you have been hesitant because of the cost, you do not have to worry.  Orthodontic Partners has amazing finance options that make it a \"no brainer.\" They even have a full payment option!\n\nOrthodontic Partners has four locations. The office staff will ensure that you are seen at the location that best suites your needs.  When calling the office, the staff is professional and makes scheduling easy.\n\nDrs. Bruntz and Walton created a gorgeous smile.  They are caring, friendly, knowledgeable and pleasant.  They are the 1 percent provider in the nation for Invisalign.  You know you are getting the very best.  Yes, there were some changes to my habits but it was to achieve a healthy bite and a radiant smile.  The staff is wonderful in explaining the necessary accommodations.\n\nIn closing, do it for yourself! Don't put it off!  I promise you will be elated that you did.  I wish to stars I would have done this years ago.  I have been smiling from ear to ear.  Thank you to the entire staff for making my experience phenomenal.",

We went in to get a few services done and when the total came up to $1500 they wouldn't let us make payments and said if it's not paid in full they can't release the car back to us. I told them we don't have $1500. They then asked us to sign for a CREDIT CARD to get the money!! Then continued to tell us it has to be paid in full and we're not allowed to make payments and they wouldn't give us our car.

  "text": "Worst experience ever. They don't have a nurse on duty to place the IV  so the tech does it and it took 20 minutes and 3 tries.  The needle wasn't fully inserted and when the liquid ran through it spilled out of the vein. My arm is very black and blue and when I went for some blood work a week later at another business they remark how bad it looked.\nI called to find out why it is taking so long to get the report and they said  the radiologist needed to sign off and release it to my doctor. I felt like it fell through the cracks since it took 15 minutes to find that out\n. The girl said he would either sign off that date or Monday which would be a full week from when the procedure took place. I asked them to send the results to my doctor and they asked how I wanted it by cd or written.  I said by what my insurance payed for which would be both. She also said they would only send it by snail mail since they wouldn't pay for overnight. Well my Doctor received the report on 5/7/2020, so it took 17 days for her to receive it. She also told me they didn't do a requested MRI - mr head w and wo iv contrast tumor follow up with perfusion permeability.  They only did a regular MRI so i have to redo this at Penn.\n\nThe techs were very nice but back office are useless. They take at least a half hour to answer the phone and find out information.

When they brought them back they were burnt from being re-fried. I don't understand why everything took so long we were there forever it felt like we were forgotten about and it cost over $60! We've never spent that much even when we had an extra person drinking and eating with us. Would not recommend this location, we will continue to go to the location on Ina.",

I told them that my brake/parking light and engine light was on as well another mechanic telling me I had a transmission problem (my car was making noise) . I was told that because I informed them that three things were wrong with my car that they normally charge $89.99 per problem (yes I said PER PROBLEM) but since it was three things they were only going to charge me $129.99 to look at (first sign). So while I'm waiting on my car to be checked out I start looking at used cars. The sales rep comes over to help me and we start the process of purchasing a used car. He comes back with a price of $500 for my car (which is a 2013 ford c-max energy limited edition) because he was told that the transmission was bad. I asked for the diagnostic test results to show that and he never showed me (he told me that a certified tech informed him). I said let me take my car out of here only to come and find out that it was a water-pump. I will never be taking my car to another dealership.",

  "text": "This is actually owned by Brunswick which totally kicked up a notch for me because in all of my past experiences of all alleys combined, Brunswick knows their game when it comes to maintaining the lanes. The oil patterns have been fantastic each time and if it is too oily, just bowl one game with wiping off the ball with the bowling ball towel each time to help displace and remove the excess oil with your own pattern.  \n\nMy first impression of the interiors was yeah, they're outdated with the wall decor, but the carpet looked 1-3 years new, unless I am wrong. The walls and back wall of the alley are very faded and compels me to ask the owner if I can be commissioned to touch up on the paint! ha!\n\nI had totally forgotten that Brunswick is one of the few companies that does the red-pin hours where if you do knock down that one red pin in a frame, you win either drinks, food, or a free game. When you do encounter that and win, go to the front desk immediately to receive your voucher other wise you lose that chance.\n\nThere are leagues and from what I have seen so far, the people that participate are pretty good and I wouldn't mind joining a league at some point when there's one suitable for my schedule.\n\nAlso, don't forget to take a look at the back of your receipts as there's a couple that gives away coupons of BOGO games or $5 games, etc. But I have noticed the billing print fades before the month is up to prove that you got this receipt before the 30 days are up to use the coupon. Kinda sucked.\n\nOne negative thing about this particular location is that it's tucked on a commercial street between commercial or industrial type of buildings with semi-weak lighting outside that it may make it dangerous for a lone person to park away from the bowling alley at night. Just be aware of your surroundings even though this area isn't overall \"dangerous\".",

  "text": "My husband and I were traveling together and this hotel experience was less than desirable. I booked this stay through the Southwest Airlines website since we would need travel/shuttle service to the airport in Indianapolis the next morning. We checked in and went to our room. The exterior and lobby of the hotel was nice however the rooms were very dated and the King room was extremely small. It felt warm in the room so we turned the air down to 70 (it was set at 77) after about an hour it did not feel any cooler so we moved the air down again to 67 and called the front desk. The lady said she would send someone right up. A little over an hour and a half later we still had not seen anyone but we had to be up for an early flight in about 4 1/2 hours so I called down again to the desk and explained that we would \"tough it out\" due to our early departure. There was no apology, just an \"okay, thanks for letting us know.\" Throughout the night the room reached about 78 degrees. Once we left the room to check out and went to the lobby we realized the air conditioning was out in the entire hotel. It was about 85-90 degrees in the lobby. Upon check out I asked the man at the desk of I needed to do anything since I was leaving my car for a week. He said, \"yea, it's $6/day... You'll need to pay.\"  I told him I booked through the Southwest site and was supposed to have had the \"park and fly\" rate. He said, \"well you don't so you need to pay.\" He was extremely rude and again no apology for the extreme heat in our rooms. I asked him politely if there was anything he could do about the charge since i was under the impression I would not have to pay and our room being nearly 80 degrees and he responded with, \"well it's hot down here too!\" I about lost my shit! I told him he GETS paid to be there and I PAID to be there! He then went to \"get security.\" I'm not sure why no one was yelling but the security \"guard\" came out and said it was fine to park \"this time\" for no charge. I quickly responded, \"no worries, due to your lack of decent customer service, I won't be staying here again.\" Something as simple as an apology and a slight compensation would have prevented this review being so negative.",

  "text": "I played Yelp Roulette for Castleton.  They were some other options I wanted to try like burgers and BBQ, but I had that recently. #40 on the list was Joella's.  As I looked at the menu, it claimed the winning spot for my supper.\n\nJoella's is a little different from your standard fast food chicken places.  You get to choose your level of spice, more side options, and dipping sauces you do not get from other establishments. \n\nI went with the Jumbo tenders at the Ella's Fav level with red-skin mashed potatoes and green beans.  For checking in to Yelp, I also got a big wing, which I almost had to argue about receiving.  The tenders were big, juicy, and on the spicy side.  The green beans were ok but the mashed potatoes was very creamy and delicious. The wing had good flavor but has the flaws of most wings, not enough meat and some maneuvering.\n\nOne sauce comes with the meal and one sauce is just not good enough for this sauceaholic. So I chose 5 and paid an extra 50 cents for each one.  A description of the sauces I tried are: Jojo (Mustard BBQ), Bama white (a lot of horseradish), cheerwine BBQ (Cheerwine is a chery flavored soda), pimento ranchero (ranch with pimento cheese), and my favorite  - the spiked honey.  I am having a hard time thinking of a sauce similar to it.  Either way, that's the sauce I'm choosing next time then either the Jojo or Pimento Ranchero.\n\nFor dessert, they have pie in a jar.  I had the chocolate peanut butter one which was very fulfilling. I get to keep the jar too.\n\nSweet tea was Indiana level sweet tea which means barely sweet.  But it was fresh-brewed. \n\nI thought of Joella's as a better Southern Pop-eyes.  If you love fried chicken with some heat, come give it a try.",

Located in the equally adorable Hyde Park, you can take your dessert to-go and explore the area during the warmer months. \n\nThe shop itself is adorable from the inside and out. It gives you a classic old-timey kind of feel. When you walk in, you are immediately greeted by the smell of fresh caramel popcorn. There is a long display of delectable chocolates and candies with a wide variety to choose from. \n\nNow their specialty and what most people come here for is their handmade ice cream. Every flavor I've ever tried has not disappointed. Their sundaes are to die for, and their make-your-own sundaes allow for creativity and absolute satisfaction. I asked for one with a waffle bowl with one scoop of chocolate cheesecake and another of coffee, complete with marionberry toppings. I was all sugared out by the time I finished, but in a good way!\n\nGoody's is a classic in Boise that everyone needs to visit if in town. Do yourself a favor and check it out!",

In 2004 they did the living room, dining room, kitchen and hallway. Beautiful job. In 2014 we decided to do two more rooms with the same product.

A home office with a lot office equipment, book cases and such (hence the hesitation to do this room).  They came out and again were able to weave and match to the existing floors.

  "text": "I just got home from a private party here and had to hit the keyboard with a review, because I was just so pleased. As a Cherry Hill resident, I know places like this - little restaurants stuck in a strip mall on Route 70 - can seem drab and become quickly passed by, but Kuzina by Sofia is absolutely worth the stop.\n\nThe spread tonight was delicious, and the pulled out all the stops - giant pieces of king crab leg, a bowl of crab meat to top crackers, jumbo shrimp, a cheeseboard, and an assortment of salads. Equally as impressive were the hot hors d'oeuvres, served by a team of incredibly friendly and adorable waitresses, who managed to bring piping hot food to everyone, despite the squeeze of the crowd in the relatively small space. The owner and his wife (Sophia), were dressed impeccably and made sure to check in with everyone, which was a nice reminder that eating here is supporting a small local business.\n\nAs a bonus, its BYOB, so you can bring your own wine and save your money for more food! I'll definitely be back for more.\n\nEdit: Assad, the aforementioned classy owner, sent me a message regarding my review when he saw this. Clear sign of how dedicated they are to customers here!",

  "text": "After living in Philly for 4 years and considering myself a self-proclaimed \"foodie\", this dining experience was long anticipated. My sister in law made a reservation 2 months in advance, waiting up until midnight to snag an 8pm reservation last night for my father's birthday. Zahav was so kind to print a personalized happy birthday message on the menu, which my father thought was cool and kept a menu for himself.\n\nWe had a party of 6 and opted for the tasting menu. The waitstaff was very attentive, thorough, and explained the dishes as they were coming out. For the table, we got two orders of the salatim (six vegetable salads) and to my surprise, the cabbage was my favorite! I could eat bowls of it!\n\nNext we got to choose two hummus dishes, in which we chose the Turkish (served warm) - this tasted like mashed potatoes - consistency and all. But I enjoyed it nonetheless. The other hummus we chose was the tehina, which was tasty, but it was more of a \"typical\" hummus has there was no special twist or flavoring. The laffa was fresh, hot, and aplenty. They brought us out a third laffa upon request.\n\nAh, then the mezze course. Each of us got to choose two, so we ended up with 12 mezze. Now these plates are small but 12 was a LOT. My favorites were the amba pickled egg and the kibbe naya. My family really seemed to like the grilled haloumi. I even tried a duck heart, which was new for me!\n\nBy this point we were FULL but had two courses left! Each of us chose an entree, but we doubled up on the hanger steak and opted out of the mushroom. Each kebab was just big enough for each of us to have about 2-3 bites. The bronzino was cooked perfectly and very flavorful - my favorite part was the fresh tzatziki that it was served over. Rice accompanied the kebabs. Honestly I would have been fine without this entire course, but that's only because..\n\nHAD to save room for dessert! Wow - this course stole the show. The waitstaff brought out a candle for my father's birthday and - just wait - EIGHT desserts for six people. We were blown away. We got two of each dessert - wow! My dad could not stop raving about the olive oil cake while my mom and sister in law enjoyed the decadent malabi custard. My personal favorite was the sorbet over the coconut rice pudding, YUM! The least favorite of the group seemed to be the chocolate tehina mousse. \n\nThe dinner ended up taking about 3 hours, and we enjoyed every minute. Can not wait for my next opportunity to return to Zahav!",

Super friendly staff and they offer a wide range of different coffee drink options which is surprising since the place is so small. They have 1 power outlet and not really a place to sit and work all day but it's great if you are watching a show at the Straz and need your coffee fix. They offer seating outside and no bathrooms. Sitting inside you can hear the show that's performing through the walls which I thought was amusing. They serve Buddy Brew coffee so you can't go wrong with that since it's a local favorite. Good luck finding parking but if you're in the area or going to the Straz Center I recommend checking out this place.",

  "text": "This place is like shopping in the ghetto for a car.\n\nThe epitemy of every used car salesman cliche you can think of lurks here. \n\nWhen my brother needed a car and had not so great credit we decided to shop here. Since I'm the car buying expert I went along to handle the financing and negotiating end of it. Needless to say, as a female, this did not go over well with the sales staff.\n\nHe ended up with a decent car but the stereo they installed stuck out of the dash and they said they'd repair it. He brings it into them a couple days later as arranged and when he picks it up that night the stereo is in but the air and heat now don't work.\n\nHe brings it back as instructed, the next day and they fix the heat. Brings it back the next day so they can fix the air but is told it will be a couple days and he should get a rental. Why should he pay when he bought the car three days ago?? Because it;s \"not their fault they have to order a part\"\n\nOk, thank goodness for that lemon law rule. Once I threatened the owner with filing it (becauase we were on our third trip in for the same issue) the owner got loud rude and obnoxious with me. He ended up screaming at me \"Why don't you just bring it back then!?\" OK buddy, will do, but since they still had it (Duh) all I needed to do was to go in person and say \"We've decided to take you up on the deal, return the car and we've cancelled the financing\"\n\nAmazing how this jerk turned into a now smooth talking business man who will do anything he can to help the car along.\n\nNo kidding, within the time of us being there to \"negotiate\" the return the air is fixed, the stereo is set, and brother is on his way. (He really needed a car with financing or we would have gone elsewhere)\n\nThe ONLY reason to come here is to obtain financing with bad credit, the rest of us luckily can go elsewhere. But keep in mind, even with bad credit, you can apply directly to Mid Atlantic finance company in Clwr (that's where Park AUto Mall finances through ) and get a loan directly without having to go through a car lot first.",

  "text": "Met some friends for a late lunch and margaritas! It was all 3 of our first times. I considered sitting outside, but there were 3 of us in our party and they said outdoor seating was only for 2 people. Slightly smells weird inside. I've gone to plenty of Mexican restaurants that remind me of this place. Our server was quite attentive. \n\nThe salsa was thin red sauce with no chunky veggies or cilantro; for my taste that was a disappointment. We ordered margaritas. My frozen mango margarita was fabulous! $5.99 for 16 oz! Someone else in my party ordered a frozen strawberry, but their machine was down because it was completely liquid syrup. Not sure why he even served it in the first place, but he replaced it. She tried an on the rock classic margarita. It was bland, watery, and just kind of gross, sadly. We all tried it. Feeling extremely guilty, she asked to switch to the frozen mango (3rd drink was a charm!) He gladly replaced it and understood. \n\nOur food came out very quickly and was piping hot! (I look for steam--it makes me so happy. I like the option of burning my palate.) I ordered the fajita chimichanga! It looks small, but I ended up taking the last bites home. Some time waiting for the check, someone knocked over a nearly empty glass on its side on to the table. It broke. Another employee immediately came over and said it would be $5 for the broken glass. At first this seems almost reasonable, but as we were thinking about it, none of us have ever been charged for breaking a glass at a restaurant. \n\nI've worked in restaurants before, glass breaks. It happens. I think the $5 charge for their cheap thin glass was silly, and it just was a bad ending to our first visit there. Overall it's pretty good, but I'd like to see them work on a few things.",

I said I dont want them she said ok took fries and dumped them in trash never sorry or anything.  so she said to me a bit later have a good day and took her stuff and left. so I ask the next bartender for a manager. manager came I explained the problem as I was talking the girl bartender came up and I told her that I've been in service industry for years and said you should ask what size beer and explain that they dont do sides. as I was asking some other bartender that was ringing up a item in pos system said everyone else does the same thing with a attitude. I said I beg your pardon manager said dont worry about her. really  that employee should be fired. anyway I said I really deal like your just trying to get as much as you can from me because I'm at airport he said that's correct. wow again. I will never eat there again and worn everyone watch out they dont care about you. sorry was hoping for a better experience.  manager did adjust my large beer and buy me one but still deal cheated.

Something worth of spreading...\n\nMy usual Thursday involves picking up the hungry kiddos after work and grabbing a quick dinner at Costco before frantically running the kiddos to their swimming class. At Costco on Cole (Boise, ID) last week, I went up to the register to pay for the food we had just ordered to realize I had left my wallet at work. I was so embarrassed, not to mention i didn't know what to do with the starving children. Then the gentleman (Roy) behind the counter, without the hesitation, paid for our meal. Maybe it was the annoyance that I was holding up the line? Maybe he could simply empathize me. Maybe he is simply a nice person. Regardless of his motivation, I'm so grateful for his act of kindness. More importantly, I am so happy my children were able to witness such a goodness in this world. Thank you, Roy!",

Alex has been walking my Penny for the past year, and does a fantastic job.  She is enthusiastic, trustworthy, and always goes above and beyond for my beloved little dog.  After filling out a detailed dossier about your pet (monster), Monster Minders pairs you with a walker based on your needs.  I have the 5X per week walk package, and my Penny gets a walk every M-F afternoon at some point within a two hour window.  After the walk, your personal page on the Monster Minders website is updated with a short note, and I enjoy checking in from the office to see how Penny's walk went.  The Minder also leaves a handwritten note in your home that is a treat to read after getting home from work.  You can manage your account and future walks easily from the website, and adding or removing walks is stress-free.   Carrie, one of the owners, also frequently checks in via email in case you need anything, which is much appreciated.  I just love that Penny has a nice walk every afternoon while I'm at work.  If you are looking for a dog walking service and want to support an excellent small business, look no further than Monster Minders!",

  "text": "My husband planned a fabulous birthday evening for my 40th along with a group of friends.  While the Paramour is beautiful and in the past we experienced a nice dinner, this visit was not exactly great.  When we arrived my husband planned for appetizers to be served with drinks in a private setting while we waited for dinner, several of the apps were more room temp than hot when served.  The space we sat in was very pretty but not at all private, At dinner we sat in a very nice private dining room, several guests were quite pleased with their meals, mine was less than mediocre.  The following day my husband reviewed the bill and noticed we spent $100's less  than the anticipated amount.  My husband contacted the manager and asked if they would offer a gift certificate/credit and mentioned that the servers and party planner never mentioned that we had not spent the amount allotted. Much to our dismay and disappointment, the Paramour was less that cooperative refused to do anything and more or less indicated it was our loss.  just very sad as we have shared this story with friends and co-workers we have discovered this to be more a common occurrence than a rarity.  We will not return due to the horrible customer service, mediocre meal and shadow they cast upon the memories of my birthday..",

  "text": "We were looking forward to a wonderful evening at Oceano Bistro with a large group to celebrate two birthdays. We had heard good things about this place and gave it a try. A couple of people in our group loved this place in the past. I don't know if the quality has slipped or if this is the new normal, but the whole group left feeling very underwhelmed by the experience. Being Restaurant Week, most of us ordered off of the special menu with a few regular menu items added. The problems started when the servers forgot to bring out two of our chowders as the first course. Eight people in our group of ten were eating while two of us had to wait until they were almost finished before we had to chance to tell them that we had not been served our first course yet. Once the chowder came, it was pretty bland. It wasn't bad, just needed more salt, pepper and spices. Next came our main course - mine was trout with mushrooms and green beans in a mushroom sauce. The trout was excellent. The mushrooms were very good, but were very sparse. Needed many more mushrooms. The green beans were too raw for me. I like a little fresh snap and crispness to my al dente vegetables, but these were way, way too raw and had no flavor either. Dessert course was either bread pudding with ice cream or a cupcake. The bread pudding was good, but the cupcake was very dry and non-edible. \n\nLastly, they did nothing to recognize the two of us that chose to celebrate our birthday at their establishment. No drink on the house or complimentary appetizer or anything. A small gesture goes a long way in showing your appreciation for your patrons and making a lasting impression. \n\nThis place was trendy and nice all around, but I was not impressed. The next time I celebrate my birthday, it will be at another establishment. There are plenty of wonderful places in which to spend my time and money.",

We called yesterday to see if we could get our tire fixed because it had a small nail it, the representative yes of course just bring your vehicle in tomorrow and we'll fix it. So, I bring in my vehicle, a pepboy representative and I walkout to look at the tire, mind you, the tire tread depth are good and where the small nail and I mean small nail was, which was in the center of the tire. He immediately tells me that he can fix it, I wish I got this person's name because he was down right being lazy. So, I took my business to another pepboys store to see if they could fix it, and guess what, they where more than happy to fix it for me. I will never recommend the pepboys on Speedway to anyone. These guys are not only the biggest rip off store in town but they really need to educate their staff on being professional and courteous to their customers. From my experience, the person that I delt  with was just down right lazy. Negative zero stars from me.",

Great for people who want to spend their money on high quality items without Saks Fith Avenue prices.  You know what the French say!  A few good pieces is better than a closet full of low quality items.  That's what you'll find here.  Lot of couture and boutique quality stuff for \"off the rack\" prices.  ENJOY.",

I wanted to like it so bad that I feel guilty for writing it but I have to be honest. The service and staff were amazing ( totally sweet and accommodating to our baby. It's a tiny place but they squeezed us in with a high chair and were very nice!) but the food was just ok. Pot stickers were tasty. I had pork chow fun with no gravy and it was relatively flavorless and kind of greasy. I don't usually say food is greasy cause I don't usually mind it and also it's like duh it's Chinese food did you think you were eating healthy? But it was like too much. Maybe better with the gravy? But the gravyless looked so yummy in the pictures! Husband got roasted duck with stir fried noodles and honestly it tasted the same as mine other than the flavor of the duck. Kinda flavorless and greasy. So weird considering all the great things I've heard! An off night? Got the wrong dishes? Maybe but two dishes being not tasty is odd I could see one but both...hmmm?! I will give them another shot though considering all the good I've heard and hope for a different experience.",

  "text": "Why is it so hard to get receipts for paying for this gym? When I first looked at joining this location at the end of June 2019 I explained that my company would pay for my gym membership, however I would need to get a receipt each month for the payment of my gym membership. Rodrigo Gomez assured me that this was not an issue and that I would be provided such a receipt each month. The next month I did not receive such a receipt so I went to the gym to speak with someone on July 15th. The worker on duty apologized and once again promised that they would provide me a receipt on a monthly basis. The following month I was not provided a receipt. I once again had to go to this location to request a receipt, and this is when I met Molly Mann.  I explained to Molly my need to have a receipt, which I had previously been promised I would receive twice, and that they still aren't providing me with receipts. Molly was extremely condescending with me during our discussion. I had to point out to her that they haven't provided me with receipts but only confirmations of charging my credit card. I even had to show her a receipt from a separate transaction from this same location before she finally admitted that their receipts had to come from their POS system, and what they had provided me wasn't from their POS system.  Molly assured me that she would personally take care of this going forward and I wouldn't have to ask for a receipt from them again.  It is now late September and I still haven't been provided a receipt for this month's membership. I emailed Molly to follow up on this on Sept 9th and she has neither answered my email nor sent me a receipt and it is now Sept 24th. I no longer feel comfortable coming to this gym and want my membership immediately canceled. You haven't held up to what your employees have promised me on multiple occasions.",

  "text": "Definitely very appealing vegan fare... I love that the menu is short and every dish seems to have a lot of thought put in it. I ordered the noodles and the cauliflower 65.\n\nNoodles were just amazing, right from the texture of the noodles to the spice balance of the sauce/broth  and the friend mushrooms, it was all perfect. I ate the last bit of the sauce in the bowl.\n\nCauliflower 65 to me was ok, the pieces of the crisp (papad) didn't seem too fresh as they were not crispy like they should be.\n\nLoved the halo halo dessert, quite innovative mix of flavors. \n\nOverall great experience and I surely want to go and try other items on the menu. Most importantly, presentation was GREAT, hard to find in vegan restaurants. So this is a perfect place for a nice vegan dinner date.\n\nMy biggest qualm about this place is the pricing, way too high for a frequent visit.",

  "text": "My daughter got a little confused and thought she was buying Imagine Dragon tickets for West Palm Beach but instead she purchased in Tampa. She managed to get us floor so we decided to keep them and take a road trip. Since we had floor and it's first come first serve we came very early to make sure we got to the front of the line. Unfortunately for us we stood in the wrong line for a really long time. By the time we figured out what was going on we were in the back of the line of people heading to the floor. They handed out wrist bands to signify who got to be on the floor. That part was great but better signs marking the respective lines would have been helpful. Security was pretty quick but I never bring anything in with me except one credit card, my phone, and a car key. \n\nOnce inside things worked out better. We managed to find a spot along the rail and began what had to be the hottest night of my life. It was so hot that I felt dizzy at times. They sold expensive but necessary frozen lemonade on the floor which saved me. It was cash only which forced a necessary trip to the expensive cash machine. \n\nThe show was amazing. We were so close to the band and they dropped balloons and shot out confetti several times during the show. This was the most civilized crowd I have ever been in. No one pushed or tried to cut in front of me. We all just danced and had the best time. In Broward it is a fight to keep your spot. I loved the show and it made all of the uncomfortable standing and heat worth it. \n\nAfter the show arena attendants were rude about patrons leaving. I sat down for a minute to catch my breath after standing for four hours in extreme heat and I was screamed at. Since we came early we were in the front of the parking lot. Leaving was another nightmare. No one moved around us for over an hour. We were completely stuck. Parking attendants to direct traffic would have been appreciated. The concert let out at 11 and we didn't get on the road until well after 12 AM. If I came back I would take Brett M.'s advice about parking at the exit and taking a long walk to the entrance in order to be able to leave. \n\nI think how much you enjoy your show at this arena depends on the weather. This arena has covered seating but it is open on the sides with lawn seating. If there is lightening in the area they will stop the show or cut it short. That is what happened to us the night before in Palm Beach. The finale was changed to acoustic because of bad weather as people were forced out of the arena. I am so happy we decided to keep the Tampa tickets where we saw the full ending of the concert. It seems easier to get good tickets here as opposed to more populated Broward County and my daughter lives in Orlando so I may be back.",

  "text": "When my friends and I asked the hostess about the origins of Capdeville, she told us that there are two things that the owners absolutely love: \"Food and Rock n' Roll.\" Now take that idea and roll with it as you peruse the menu of eclectic entrees and appetizers ranging from Fried Red Beans and Rice to Fish Tacos. It proclaims itself to be an interpretation of a British social house that has been Americanized, and I think they have that spot on. The atmosphere gives a since of freedom that allows the patrons to be both elegant and relaxed, whichever one is more their style.\n\nAs far as food goes (and I think the other reviewers will back me up on this one), it is a complete necessity for someone at the table to order the Truffled Mac n' Cheese. Take about melt in your mouth deliciousness right there. It's incredibly rich, but by the time you've finished it, you'll still want more. The burgers are also pretty spectacular. I personally tried the Capdeville Burger, which was everything I wanted and more. The fries were delicious and perfectly seasoned (not too salty like at some places), and the price was absolutely acceptable. \n\nThe only down-side of our trip was a not-exactly-delightful Pimm's Cup. You'd think it would be difficult to mess up a Pimm's Cup (my personal cocktail of choice), but whoever made it did a pretty good job of doing so. It seemed hastily made (perhaps because there was a pretty large crowd at the bar when we ordered) and wasn't worth the $9 they were going to charge. This problem, however, was immediately solved by our waiter who was super cool and took it back. We opted for Abita Strawberry instead, a great combination with the burger and fries. \n\nWhich brings me to my favorite part: the staff. I suppose I'm not very familiar with the staff as a whole, but the waiter and the hostess that helped us were absolutely stellar. The waiter was very helpful and completely cool with us sending back the Pimm's cup (sometimes you get those stuffy types that don't hesitate to let you know how much of an inconvenience it is - not the case here). The hostess (Lauren) was also fantastic. She got us settled as soon as she could, and even paid us a few visits and answered the questions we had about the restaurant and the inspiration for it. And it was thanks to her that we got to have the most delicious dessert ever: King Cake Bread Pudding. I kid you not, friends. This bread pudding was made from a Haydel's King Cake that was brought in earlier that morning, and it was divine. \n\nSo all-in-all, I think it's safe to say that Capdeville will be a place that I will frequent often for their delicious food and even more delicious prices.",

  "text": "Delicious. I went there with some family friends a couple weeks ago, and it was hard not to drool all over the menu. I am a big fan of the prices, the small, intimate setting, and the overall laid back vibe. Building up to my visit, every single person told me to get the Krispy Kreme Bread Pudding. So, of course, I got it (our table also got the bacon brownie, yum). While I'm not much of a dessert person, the bread pudding was delicious. We shared the two desserts between the 5 of us, which was the perfect amount. The Pimm's Cup was just right, and the Boudin Balls were amazing. \n\nWe had made reservations, since it's a pretty small place, but were running late because of work. We called, and they said no problem, so we showed up about 20 minutes after reservation time, but got a seat right away. I can't guarantee this luck with everyone, since I tried to book a couple weeks later for a Friday night and they were all booked up. If you show up and get lucky, it'll be worth the wait. I can't remember the name of our waitress, but she was an absolute sweetheart. Trust me, you will not be disappointed with the food and the atmosphere here. And if you are, then I have my doubts about you. :)",

  "text": "I've been coming to this Taco Tote for a few years now, always bringing my kids who love it as much as I do. It's simple counter service tacos with a decent sized salsa/fixings bar and a 144-flavor coke machine at a good price. I tend to go with Chicken Adobodo (which I can never pronounce right and end up saying the \"bodo\" part about three times) while my kids enjoy the various \"fajita\" tacos (chicken or beef). They have limited kids meals (chicken nuggets or a taco) but I've never heard complaints (and often snag and extra nugget to dip in some salsa - part of a standard Dad's right to \"taste test\" the food. You know... for quality).\n\nYou can see the cooks preparing the food behind the cashier - chopping up the fresh meats and cooking them on the grill. It always comes out hot and the tortillas are some of the best I've ever had (you'd think a flour tortilla is a flour tortilla, but they know how to make a *good* tortilla at this place). I like to drizzle some dark, smokey \"salsa\" on my tacos with lettuce, lime juice (from little wedges), and a bit of guacamole salsa. I'll fill a few tubs of various \"hot\" salsas for dipping my chips as well - love to mix and match a few flavors. The beans and rice are pretty standard (part of the 4 stars) - part of a combo - but you can also get the \"pack\" which includes a baked potato instead. It's as delicious as a baked potato can be.\n\nAs for the coke machine - the kids *love* these new touch screen fountain soda machines with upwards of 144 flavors. Grape Mellow Yellow mixed with cherry fanta? You got it. Vanilla Barq's rootbear with a splash of peach coke and some diet lime sprite? Uhm... no. But you can have it if you want it!\n\nOverall, tacos are a solid 5 in my book. The rice and beans are just regular, standard fare - 3 stars. The addition of the kid-favorite soda machine is always a nice bonus - a solid 5 there. Sometimes in the *back* section of the restaurant, in the booths by the windows you will get some annoying flies - definitely a 3 for that, but they stick to that back area, which is hot anyway from the large windows and so best to be avoided. Overall... 4 stars. Tada! I *can* do basic math. And Taco Tote can do good tacos (which is really what this review is about).",

  "text": "Sweet Tomatoes is a craving. It's also my post half marathon meal go to- buffet/all you can eat? Yes please.\n\nI love eating here, even though it's not the best food I've ever had. The salad bar is always clean and fresh. My go-to's-  Chinese chicken won ton salad and the tuna tarragon. On the soup side, there are always the staple chicken noodle chunk and kettle house chili options as well as 1-2 vegetarian options(split pea or lentil seem to be the regulars). There are usually 1-2 others in rotation- French Onion and/or clam chowder. The seasonal soups are always the best in my opinion. The Albondigas Mexican soup is my favorite. The bakery section is the star of this location - offering 3-4 different biscuit/muffins including the seasonal one, dessert cobbler of the season, as well as a focasia, pizza bread, and sourdough/multigrain bread. Let me not forget to mention the frozen yogurt machine and toppings. Dessert sundae is always a must! I usually steer clear of the pastas and mac and cheese. They're bland and overall not so great.\n\nSometimes this location can be a little messy with people slopping soup and random food everywhere, but more times than not, it's clean and there is always someone ready to pick up my empty plates/bowls as soon as I'm done.\n\nSign up for the Club Veg emails and get coupons galore. I never come here without some kind of 20%off or other discount coupon! Makes it much more worth than the $12 dinner price tag.",

  "text": "We were visiting here from TN and found this close (about 7 mins) to the airport. It was smaller than the pictures on Yelp make it seem but that didn't take away from the experience at all. We went about 430 on a Saturday evening. It wasn't busy at all. The bar was open and there are about 6 tables in the front but they also have a more secluded room in the back with a pool table for private gatherings. When we first walked i. The music was playing \nSo the vibes were nice!  We got a table and the man behind the bar came right over to greet us and get our drink orders. They had a full bar and carried a lot of different beers. We just ordered Corona (no pun intended lol). A young lady then came over and took our orders. We got the chicken Philly egg rolls w/tots  and the fish and chips. The eggs rolls i believe are homemade (not frozen) because she asked if we wanted onions, mushrooms, and jalapeños in them-even gave us a option on which cheese we wanted in them. The fish was crispy and fried to perfection and the fries great too! Overall, this visit was great and they service was also great. The guy even gave us some good places to visit while in the city! Great service !",

I actually had the weekend off for once, so we made sure to hit up as many of the events and bars as our livers could handle. BRU Craft & Wurst was celebrating their 1st birthday so we hit them up for a late lunch.\n\nThey had a live band performing (mostly covers), and although they were good performers, DEAR LORD was it loud inside! We asked to be seated as far from them as possible, and it was still incredibly difficult to hear one another. A place that primarily shills beer/alcohol should foster conversation, not lonely consumption. We like the concept of the 'self serve' drafts that charge you per ounce, but for this latest visit we stuck with the bar's draft list. They had some sandwich specials as part of their celebration - we shared the roasted pork and garlic pork sausage with sauerkraut, both of which had pickles and chips. The food was great with our cold brews, both meats super juicy and tender and instantly put us in a summer state of mind. If it wasn't for the loud music, we would've hung out longer and had another drink, but our ears were ringing and we left to enjoy the sunshine.",

  "text": "If you want an experience with impeccable staff, service and good...tululahs garden is the place. After eating there after the Moshulu, I was so upset that I didn't book them. The difference of attention from staff and care was most noticeable and the food was to die for. I Agree with Jackson and the other reviews below about the Moshulu. Food mediocre, staff inattentive and lack the care for guests and definitely not the place if you want your occasion to be special. I can't believe the difference of how we were treated with a special occasion at tululahs garden a week later, vs Moshulu. I told the staff at tulalahs how awful our whole experience at Moshulu was and how I wish I would have booked them instead. I dined at Moshulu years ago for a brunch buffet and was really excited to come back. I made a very special request weeks in advance and although requests aren't guaranteed, staff wasn't prepared with any knowledge of what I asked to be written in the book. Hostess didn't seem knowledgeable about seating logistics. Our table was immediately inside the door to the left facing the parking lot which defeated our initial excitement and choice of booking this establishment, which was really stressed ahead of time for having a water view. I wasn't made aware of a dj on top of the ship so couldn't eat there with grandparents and loud music, Even though I asked lots of questions when booking. Waiter came over and told me it was an \"off day\" for seating rooms and an \"off day\" overall. We decided to remain at table but the rest of our special night was ruined because we chose this special place for the views and atmosphere and to celebrate a very special and meaningful milestone.. If you are seated in the ship on the left as we were, I would opt to spend that kind of money at an excellent restaurant with excellent food and stellar service such as Amada or any Jose Garces restaurant. At no point throughout the evening did any managerial staff stop over or check in or ask how everything was. When we got the bill the 20% gratuity was added to the check so it didn't matter how they treated us. The manager walked by us as we were leaving and didn't say a word, just headed upstairs. No goodnight, no nothing. The lack of care and professionalism made this worse. Plates stacked on table while tea was being served. Crumbs everywhere and nothing reset. I don't care too much about a reset table but in what's listed as fine dining, I was surprised. Worst $550 I have ever spent and we love spending money on great food, service and experiences. It was such a letdown. When I called the next day to speak to a manager, the Owner's daughter was very nice and promised a call back later in the day. I didn't receive a call that day, No call the next day, the day after. I called back a few times as The lack of acknowledgment first at the restaurant and now by phone, really solidified the lack of care that the manager on duty displayed that night. I finally received a phone call exactly 7 days later. Manager was rude, condescending, and placed blame on me and questioned my feelings. He scoffed at my explanation of events and only apologized for how I feel but nothing on the restaurants end. I was frustrated and questioned by someone who didn't show his face once that night but claimed he was there and claimed his staff was beyond excellent. He told me I was a waste of his time. If this was the case, why would I have called and why would I be leaving a review on yelp? I opened a yelp account years ago and I don't remember using it since years ago. The manager really could have made things so much better by being nice, respectful and at least trying to understand. He instead made fun of me, made me feel like everything was my own fault and insulted me. I would have loved to be invited back for a redo in a nicer location on the ship as I originally requested or on s day where it wasn't \"off\" as the server stated but now, not only will we never come back there or any sister locations in the city, we will never recommend  Moshulu or any of their sister places to our friends or any one else. I stand by Jose Garces establishments for their professionalism, food, and service. I have never been treated so poorly by someone who chose his career in the restaurant business in my life. Awful, hurtful and sad. Waste of money.",

  "text": "On a quick weekend trip to Nashville, I almost forgot to visit the Country Music Hall of Fame & Museum! I am so glad that I was able to get in a visit before heading to the airport!  \n\nFirst - it is a gorgeous building, outside and inside the lobby.  It's very well designed, with soaring ceilings and windows in the front, and beautiful wood floors.  There is a sweeping staircase and elevators.  The walls are covered with awards and names of musicians.\n\nNo, wait - for real first off - everyone is really friendly here.  The ladies at the ticket counter, the folks at the coat check (complimentary!) and the young man at the beverage kiosk.  All super nice. \n\nThe place is CLEAN.  The floors - whether stone, cement, wood or carpet - all clean.  Walls and windows - clean.  Sparkling.  They are paying attention to this - there was not a speck of litter anywhere.  The cases around the exhibits were crystal clean - and I didn't see people pushing their fingers up against them and getting them all dirty.\n\nThere are plenty of \"hands on\" kinds of exhibits for listening to music and getting information but so much of the visual part of the museum is composed of clothing.  The place is full of headless mannequins wearing the most amazing array of outfits I never did see in my life.  I have to confess - I love the costume exhibits at the local art museums in San Francisco - and this really made the museum compelling for me.  All the outfits are properly fitted on mannequins which stand at the size/height of the original wearer of the item -- so it gives you a sense of how big and tiny some of these folks were (Loretta Lynn was tinytinytiny!).  \n\nThere were so many great artifacts there, in addition to outfits there were instruments, automobiles and many other things.  I would definitely return and would love to attend a special event there.  My mom was very jealous.",

  "text": "I was lucky enough to go on a private tour on a Saturday afternoon with a few friends. Co-owner Andrew was our guide and he did a fantastic job telling us all about the rum making process and explained everything in an easy-to-understand manner. Roulaison is a small and new rum distilling company and, I'll be honest, I know nothing about liquor production. Everything here is handcrafted and it's all local. All of this was pretty new to me, but I found the tour very interesting and Andrew was extremely nice and was happy to answer questions.\n\nAfter the tour came the tasting and I'm not a liquor drinker, so this got real interesting. I can usually handle liquor if it's mixed with something, so I was thankful for the teeniest little thimble full of samples that we had to try. Some of the rum burned, but that's probably because I \"can't hang\". By the third taste I had to reach for water- I'm such a lightweight. I did, however, really enjoy the rum liqueur that was offered, mainly because it had some sweetness to it. You can actually have them mix you up a cocktail, if that's your thing.\n\nI highly recommend the tour, especially if you like learning about new things and how things are made.",

  "text": "Minando has a pretty good buffet, especially considering we went for lunch and not dinner, AND for a (primarily) sushi buffet. We went on a Friday afternoon and it was busy but not full. Our server was friendly and always filled our drinks quickly. Apparently this place used to have a liquor license but it's now BYOB. This is perfect because there is a Wine and Spirits right next door. \n\nI was impressed with the sheer amount of sushi and salad offerings. All of the rolls tasted fresh and didn't taste or look like they had been sitting out. The \"Friday only\" lobster roll was pretty good. They had a large variety of roll types, even my mom (not a huge sushi fan) was able to find 5 or 6 rolls that she really loved. I tried almost every single one and didn't really have any terrible ones, some of them had too much mayo sauce for my taste though. Overall it's the best sushi buffet I've been to. However, keep in mind it IS a buffet. The sushi, while good and fresh, isn't likely to be the BEST you've ever had if you're comparing it to fancier/expensive/whatever restaurants. Nothing wrong with that, though. The salads were all decent and varied from one another. \n\nThe hot section was okay, I'm not sure if this changes much at dinner. I wasn't expecting too much from the hot section because we went expecting to eat mainly sushi. My only real complaint about the hot section was the beef teriyaki: it looked nice but was impossible to chew. Everyone in our party tried it, but it was just too tough. Maybe it was an off day? The chicken teriyaki was good, as were the rest of the things on the hot bar.\n\nEven though I had my fill of sushi and other food, I HAD to try the green tea soft serve for dessert. Delicious! I also tried the chocolate, raspberry, and green cake bites. All of them were good. They also had flan, if that's your thing. \n\nI recommend Minando. People say it's expensive but I definitely thought the $17/person lunch was worth it. I can't vouch on the $30/person dinner. Check it out!",

  "text": "Came here because i got bird droppings on my car while visiting a friend in the area and because I had a good experience at their Cherry Hill location.\nAfter my wash I noticed that not all of the bird droppings came off. I said so to the manager, who cleaned the spots personally and rewashed my car. Every time I've visited a Diamond Express location I've received excellent, courteous service.\nI must say, I don't understand some of the reviews on here.\nI get a bad staff review, people have bad days and while in a perfect world everyone would be bright and cheery all the time that just isn't the case in the real world. I generally wouldn't mention such a thing unless it was a regular occurrence or the owner/manager failed to address it.\nThe people that said they're car came out with dirty wheels and whatnot... apparently you didn't bother saying anything. I mean, it's a machine, not a human detailer. I'd expect something to get missed on occasion, or an extra dirty something (like wheels) to not be 100% clean. I had that issue, said something, and they fixed right away _with an apology_.\nPeople make mistakes, so do machines. It's not right to give a bad review without letting the business try to rectify the issue.\nThe lady that said a chunk of paint came off her car? I don't understand how that could have possibly happened. The only thing that touches the cars is cloth, foam, and soap. I asked about the material they use at their Cherry Hill location, not only was the gentleman very knowledgeable about the material, he further put any concerns to rest by letting the brush hit his hand while it was turning. How was his hand ok but your car paint isn't?\nDon't listen to the naysayers. This place is great.",

The marinated shrimp had beautiful complex flavors - none which overpowered the other.  I still wonder where they get bonnet peppers in Nola.  The Roasted Brussel Sprouts and roasted beets were next level. The hamachi & melon was an unexpected yet perfect pairing.  From the hostess to the bus boy the staff was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu and ingredients.  The restaurant is in a comfortable space and the crowd was energized and vibrant.

  "text": "I am specifically reviewing the bakery at this location. Now, Fry's doesn't exactly come to mind when I think of the bakery I most want to go to, but I wanted one of those birthday cakes with the thin picture wafer. We were having my little boy's birthday party with a Star Wars theme and I ordered a cake with a picture of my son during Padawan training at Disneyland. \nThe party was starting at 2:00, I ordered the cake to be ready at 1:00. I figured the less time we had with the cake, the less damage could be done to it. \nAs it always turns out, my husband was ready way before me. He was just sort of waiting around while I was busy with my hair. So he asked, \"Should I go get the cake?\" What could possibly happen, right? \nHe leaves. I finish getting ready. I make sure I have everything I need. Candles, camera, treat bags, everything has been checked off my list. The kids have been ready for a while. Where is my husband? He calls. \n\nme: (instead of answering \"hello\") where are you? \nhim: I've been trying to call you. I dropped the cake\nme: (total, complete silence) \nhim: hello? \nme: you're kidding, right? \nhim: NO! I dropped the cake. It's windy and I was trying to open the door and blah, blah, blah (I sort of drifted out or passed out for a while)\nme: (quiet again)\nhim: oh, so what, now you're mad? \nme: uh . . . .no . . . . just . . . .well, go buy another one. I mean, what else can we do? (I was in a sort of daze really. I wasn't even mad, just numb)\nhim: OK, I'll call you back\n\nAs it turns out, he went back in with the remains of the first cake. The bakery people saw it and made him a whole new one - exactly the same as the first one-  with the picture and all. AND . . . .  wait for it . . .  wait for it . . . . . for free! Yes, they didn't charge him. Plus, they had it ready for him in about 10 minutes. They are complete life savers. I joked with my husband that the bakery people probably thought he had a super mean wife and felt bad for him. Either way, they saved the party and saved my husband some grief. Too bad nothing can save him from all the \"cake dropping\" snarky comments he's been getting.",

I ordered seafood gumbo and my boyfriend ordered a combination plate with jambalaya, etouffee and shrimp creole , we also ordered bbq shrimp, everything was great!

  "text": "Tang Bistro's been on my radar ever since it first opened. A lot of Northern Chinese spots seem to have opened up recently (South Silk Road, Blossom Northern China Cuisine and Chinese Crepe). TB specializes in Xi'an cuisine.\n\nWe came on a Tuesday evening and the place was half full. The inside is quite spacious and even has a patio facing out onto 109 Street (after all, it housed Urban Diner). The menu is beautifully done and more upscale than your normal Northern Chinese spot.\n\n- Liang-pi (cold noodles) ($7.50) - crap, I didn't realize that you had the option of getting this non-spicy, mild, medium or intense! Would love to see how \"intense\" it really gets. The cold noodles had a chewy, slippery bite. Comes with the usual bean sprouts, julienne cucumbers and spongy gluten. Good but I prefer Noodle Feast's version.\n- Cucumber salad with garlic sauce ($6.50) - the cucumbers had a satisfyingly crunchy bite. The vinegar/garlic sauce was bright and refreshing. Would get this again.\n- Spicy pig ears ($9.50) - the spicy pig ears had a tasty chili oil sauce. Great texture but the portion was pretty small for the price. CC thought it came in a \"ear shaped\" bowl.\n- Scramble egg & tomato ($10.50) with hand pulled noodles ($2.00) - the hand pulled noodles had a great chewy toothsome bite to them and the egg & tomato sauce worked well with the noodles. The combo felt like you were eating Italian with an Asian spin to it. The egg reminded me some sort of delicious cheese. I know that sounds weird but it was good.\n\nThe dishes are a bit on the oily side of things but everything was solid. Will be back to try more dishes. 3.5 stars.",

This lovely pastel colored, open air space is exactly what the area needed and where many will, and should be flocking to this summer. \n\nThe tunes were bumping, thanks to a solid dj. The kids were playing in modern formations and on rocking horses. The doggies were wagging their tails, as they're welcome here, and folks were grabbing drinks from various shops shaped like cargo shipping boxes! Way cool! They included a Tiki bar, Craft Cocktail Concepts by Blume, Urban Village Brewing and more! Think anything from exclusive IPAs on draft to Frose' (frozen rose') and sangria. A lil something for everyone! \n\nAll were enjoying the sunshine and good vibes.\n\nThere's a decent variety of food...Mama Maria's Italian Ice, Urban Empanada Box, Passyunk's own Essen Bakery, Tokai for vegan French Toast and bacon a la cart, Bru, Lil Sum Sum for dim sum and Spread Bagelry. \n\nThere are some shadier areas and pretty textured white umbrellas. There are also really cool modern seating options. \n\nThere are light strands, cut out iron lamp poles and marquee lights on the shops for at night. \n\nThere's also a stage! I can't wait to see who performs! \n\nThere's giant wooden Jenga and a neat viewing platform. \n\nThere's even a toy store with bubbles and chalk to keep your kiddos busy. \n\nIt's definitely a unique space I'm thrilled to see! It's so nice to have a reason to come back to this area again!!\n\nOh, and the friendly looking robot statue named Bebot, who was originally created for Burning Man at the entrance, is so fun! \n\nDog park, large kids' space and nursing areas to come...\n\n*As of Monday June 10th, the parking lot to the left of the entrance will have FREE parking with validation from any of the shops!\n\n**Restroom are air-conditioned trailers in the rear of the park.",

  "text": "I'd like to start my review by acknowledging that Jeny took her time and thoroughly tried to fix what someone else in the salon started. I am very happy with the customer service and patience she gave me. That being said, I will still never return. I walked in without an appointment and asked for a full set of acrylic nails. I was greeted instantly by the owner/manager and sat at station 6. I told the man I wanted long tapered shaped similar to a \"coffin\" but not bowed out at the natural nail line. He seemed to understand what I meant. What first bothered me was that he did not clean my natural nails; did not trim them or push back and cut the cuticles. He used the nail drill to file the tops of my nails which is not a good practice as it makes the natural nail too thin. Then he glued on the nail tips. He did it very quickly and carelessly, so some of them were noticeably crooked but I figured that could be at least somewhat corrected along the way. He asked me how thick I wanted the nails and I explained I wanted them to be thick enough so that they were strong and had a nice curved apex (highest point in the middle of the nail plate). I started noticing how bad they looked while he was filing the sides and they only got worse after shaping and the final filing. Instead of the tapered square look I'd asked for, he did a dramatic coffin shape. I can understand there may have been some confusion due to a language barrier, but every single nail was terribly uneven and the apex on every nail was flat. Not to mention they were much shorter than I wanted. I stopped him and pointed out, explaining very thoroughly, each flaw. He said he did not see any problems with them and his other customers would've been happy with them as they were. I told him I was unhappy with the nail shape and wanted corrected. I spoke with the manager and waited 30 minutes until someone else was available to correct my nails. That's when Jeny did her best to correct the work. I am still really unhappy with the end result but I appreciate her trying to fix someone else's mistakes. The manager and the man who I originally started my nails made me feel like I was just a difficult customer because I was unhappy with the poor work done.",

I was just there two weeks ago. So, as most people point out, the place is classy but expensive....and the portions are a bit on the skimpy side. I like going during happy hour (which I don't think they are having anymore) when the drinks and some appetizers are at a discounted price. Atmosphere is trendy and fresh. My only complaint is the chairs aren't that comfortable to sit on and chat. My girl friend and I split two  appetizers and had some wine. Both appetizers were fresh and tasty. I am not going into details in describing them because I am not sure if they are even still on the menu. I am willing to give this new pizza place a shot, but I really hope they have a happy hour.",

And I will preface this by saying I have been to two other Wasabi's (the one downtown, and the one out in Town and Country) and both of those locations were pretty good. The service at this Wasabi was wonderful, so I am not complaining about service. It was the food. Just terrible. I ordered a lot of nigiri.... amaebi, ikura, maguro, sake, tataki tuna, and uni. I was really excited for the uni too. But it was AWFUL. I seriously cannot believe they would sell this to people. Did the chef even taste it? It was not 'old' or 'sitting out' for too long, just to clarify. It must have been from Maine or maybe the urchins they harvested weren't in season....I don't know what it could have been. But my taste buds do not lie. It was sour, and even bitter. Instead of being soft and smooth in texture, it was almost chewy and it was definitely firm. Blegh. Totally cockblocked as I was prepared to buy a shitton of the stuff. The other things I had were only so-so. The tuna and salmon did not have great flavor. The tuna tataki was the only redeeming piece of sushi on the entire plate. I left still hungry as I sent the uni back. They were understanding about it, but ugh. It was just awful. I am not going to bother to come back to this location if they aren't serious about ordering good quality seafood for their sushi. :(\nOn the bright side, Bob's called me the very next day to tell me they got fresh urchin in-stock. Totally made me rejoice because the uni from Wasabi was just that terrible!",

  "text": "Came her for the first time after I had been wanting to stop by for years on a Wednesday night. The place was PACKED, I think because of the gem show, but we didn't have to wait too long for a table. Unfortunately our table was right next to the front door, and it was a chilly night, so we weren't super comfortable even while wearing our jackets. Some of my review is probably a bit tainted by the fact that they were so busy, but they didn't handle the rush super well. It took awhile for someone to come take our orders, and then awhile for our food to arrive. The food didn't come all at once, but one thing at a time, which was a bit annoying when you're really hungry and just want to start eating. Also, they forgot an item from my order, so I had to wait awhile for it to arrive. I ordered the chicken vindaloo, which I expected to be spicy as vindaloo usually is, but it wasn't very spicy. I didn't find the flavor that great either, personally. Most of the Indian food I've eaten has been in the UK, so my standards may be a bit high, but I wasn't super impressed. I also had a chicken biryani that was ok but not great. Our naan was quite burnt, rendering parts of it inedible. However, the shining star of the meal was the chicken tikka masala - that may have been the best chicken tikka masala I've ever had. While I wasn't thrilled with my dish, I would definitely order the chicken tikka masala again. I also ordered a takeaway order at the same time that I placed my main, and I had to ask multiple people for it and go back to the counter in the back before I got it, after sitting and waiting for what felt like an eternity. If the chicken tikka masala wasn't so good I probably would never go back, but for that alone I would brave the crazy service just to have more",

It's a good restaurant by Burlington County standards, but if you've been outside of the area before and come back for the holidays, you know that this place is so overpriced and doesn't offer anything of quality. First, the decor is so outdated you feel like you've been transported back to a 90s banquet hall inside. The Christmas Eve menu was a mixture of fried food, steamed bag veggies for sides, and pastas in jar-like sauces. Among our dishes, we had the filet (40$ for a steak that wasn't prepared properly either the first or second time and was the size of a baby's fist); chicken francese (supposedly in a white wine sauce, but really just was a creamy/congealed butter sauce). This place is ok for senior citizen groups looking for a slightly-fancier alternative to a diner, but if you're going to pay the price this place charges, why not just go to Philly or NYC for quality food?",

The seats outside are petite bistro sets which seemed cozy and European. Being able to look at the sites in the park while eating was a plus.\nI ordered the shrimp salad and Loved it! My boyfriend ordered the cheeseburger and enjoyed it too. There are not that many food items on the menu to choose from, which was a bit of a disappointment.

  "text": "Oh wow. I had been meaning to check out this place for a long time now since I am a tremendous fan of Peruvian food. One of my best friends is from Lima and he introduced me to Peruvian ceviche (which I have to admit, is better than Mexican ceviche), tiradito, lomo saltado and of course pisco!\n\nChifa is a type of cooking that Chinese immigrants created in the 19th century when they first arrived in Peru. They would try to replicate their recipes with the ingredients found in Peru. And to this day the style still exists and is considered to be very economical, like cocina economica.\n\nAnyway, back to the restaurant. We came in with a tremendous appetite and wanting to try a bunch of things. We ordered the red curry with crab and eggplant, holy moly it was delicious! The lomo saltado, humita and Chinese pork. Everything was incredibly good. \n\nI had heard that the chef is a big fan of The Princess Bride, and he had a drink named after Iñigo Montoya. I've never seen the movie but I do know of a famouse scene in the movie with this character. The actor is Saul from Homeland, fyi. The drink is made of tequila, passion fruit and thai chilis. DELISH! The hubby went with a Cusqueña.\n\nAll in all, great atmosphere and wonderful food!",

We called back thinking it was an accident, he brushed it off like it wasn't an issue.

  "text": "It was a cheap event and found it the day prior to race day so I decided to do it. I did the 10k which had roughly 27,000 people. The only downside is (like other races) many people don't know their place even though it's announced that slower people should be towards the back. I had to weave my self through a lot of people who were just walking within the first 1/2 mile which really frustrated me. It was great and all but if you're taking the provided shuttle back be warned it will be a long wait. So, either get in line early or find your own ride back. \n\nWeather was hot and humid but there were quite a few people who ran under 5:00/mile even in this weather. Beer and food that was provided was not bad! Especially since you could grab as much as you want unlike other races where they limit the free drinks to one or two cups.",

Seems that people seated anywhere other than at one end of the bar aren't privy to that info. When I went last, it was difficult to see what price each beer was supposed to be. Happy hour prices are a vaguely advertised mystery.\n\nThe location is great. It's a spacious corner property with bike parking and lots of street parking, but the space feels haphazardly furnished, like someone threw a couple of church pews chairs into an empty hall with some tables and added a bar at one end as an afterthought. The lighting is nice for a cozy bar atmosphere, though.\n\nThey have outdoor seating and serve food, but the service is incredibly spotty. Bars shouldn't try to be restaurants if they're not interested in good food and have a way of delivering it to tables. The nachos I tried a couple of months ago were barely passable. I've been spoiled by the Cantina for too long, it would seem.\n\n\"Eehhh.\"",

  "text": "I used to consider Penang to be one of my favorite restaurants. Up until two months ago, my partner and I ate there at least twice a month, frequently taking friends who'd never tried Malaysian food and and who weren't quite sure what to order. We begin every meal with the roti canai appetizer, which is wonderful, and we were attempting to try every entree on the menu. The last time that we went, however, we didn't have such a good time. We were starving, and we were eager to have a good meal. When we entered the restaurant, the young woman behind the counter asked us if we were there for the tasting party, and we told her that no, we just wanted dinner. She kept recommending it, and we finally said that we would give it a try. We were asked to pay up front (an anomoly) before she took us to a section of the restaurant that was separate from the rest, and seated us. We sat there hungrily for more than 20 minutes without being offered food or told about food. Whoever was running the tasting party ran it like a hot mess. The young woman who appeared to be in charge (not one of the regular staff) ran back and forth talking to people that she appeared to know. We finally decided to leave, so we got up and asked the hostess for our money back. She asked us if we wanted to sit down at a regular table and order, but the restaurant was much busier than when we first arrived, so I knew it would be at least another 20 minutes before we saw any food. I firmly said no, and we left. It was an extremely disappointing experience, and I'll hesitate to go back again. It's a shame that such a crappy experience has soured me toward such a good restaurant.",

Pizza / Sandwiches /Wraps / Salads - Anything / Everything on the menu is just $5.00!!\n\nAnd It Is OUTSTANDING!  Perfect lunch size portions; Food is High Quality and the service is quick!  My personal favorites: A Buffalo Chicken Wrap with fresh, home-made potato chips; A Meat Lover's Stromboli; Cantaloni and Gravy.  The table gets a basket of garlic knots and a bowl of red gravy (spaghetti sauce) for dipping.  I Love The Red Gravy\n\nAnd what a great Red Sauce the chef has: It's just a little on the tart side,  spiced perfectly, smooth as butter and so good!  It has become my favorite restaurant red sauce.\n\nAnd they have a complete dinner menu that's as outstanding as the lunch menu; Prices for dinner are $$ but the portions are very generous.  I recently had a dinner with pasta in red sauce with a Meatball, Sausage and a Rib - It was just this side of heaven.\n\nThe dining room is small - some might say intimate - with seating for about 20 to 30 people.\n\nYou will not be disappointed - unless you like your Italian food from the freezer.  \n\nLa Tavola is a real find.  Stop in and try the lunch - You'll be back for the dinners as well. \n\nRemember - the $5.00 Lunch Menu Expires on August 31, 2011.  You Have Been Warned!",

She is convinced the meat was actually ground beef. Tacos or nachos seem to be a better bet here.

They were so sweet and accommodating - at the time I was too broke to be eating out or even buying coffee, and they didn't give me a hard time for sitting in there for ages without ordering anything. (I make sure to tip extra now, to make up for my first visit...) I went back yesterday for the first time, and was struck anew by how much I loved the atmosphere - the art, the coziness, the friendly baristas. And this time I found out how good their food and coffee are! Their bagel sandwiches are delicious and will leave you absolutely stuffed, and I disagree with the reviewer who said their coffee was over-roasted. Their iced coffee, at any rate, was perfect and not nearly as acidic and bitter as, say, Starbucks'. I wish this place weren't so far out of my way, because I'd come here every day if I could.",

Looking outside the restaurant, first impression is that it looks like a more run down restaurant but I wasn't going to base it just off looks.\n\nThe sushi is sooo good! The fish is super fresh and all were really good. The volcano roll however is a hit or miss since its served hot and wrapped in foil which is what you don't expect when eating sushi. The teriyaki bowl was okay, chicken was pretty bland. But I would definitely recommend the sushi. \n\nSun sushi however is a little on the pricier side so expect to pay more. However the quality of the sushi is well worth it. They were super stingy on the wasabi and ginger. There were 4 of us but only served one mini plate for all of us to share. The waitress was nice enough to bring out a little more but only when we asked.\n\nWe all ordered green tea ice cream for dessert along with Mochi. Can never go wrong with green tea ice cream! They even were sweet enough to sing happy birthday to my friend with a candle on the ice cream which she enjoyed very much! The waiter also offered to take pictures of as well too.\n\nOverall the sushi was great and the service was awesome!",

  "text": "The Grand Isle was the perfect place to end my trip in New Orleans. The service and food were wonderful! \n\nMy friends and I started out with the Crab Dip and the Crawfish Beignets. I absolutely loved both! The Crab Dip was piping hot and accompanied by crispy bread while the Crawfish Beignets were so flavorful and unique! \n\nAfter trying these two amazing appetizers I knew I had to order more! Thus, I also ordered the Chargrilled Oysters which were out of this world!! The oysters were smoky but the Parmesan cheese on top brought the perfect contrast! \n\nFor my main dish I ordered the Creole crawfish pasta with a side of the Smoke Fried Oysters. What can I say? I'm a hungry girl! The Creole Crawfish Pasta was creamy and yummy! The Smoke Fried Oysters were crunchy and the remoulade sauce was the perfect touch! \n\nOverall, my food palette loved this restaurant! Thank you for having us!",

  "text": "My parents recently moved to Newtown so they received a coupon for free dozen bagels from Newtown Bagel Co. Since my parents always have a bagel and coffee for breakfast, I went with my mom to pick up some bagels for them while I was visiting. We felt bad asking for just the free bagels, so we asked for 2 dozens and picked up 2 tubs of cream cheese as well.  \n\nThere was no one in the shop as we went in at around 1:30 pm and they close at 2 pm on most days.  We were greeted by a gentleman, but he went into the back as we were picking out the cream cheese and a younger girl helped us with the bagels.  \n\nI felt a bit awkward because as soon as I told the employee that we had a coupon for a free dozen and wanted to get a total of 2 dozens, she said they are pretty low on bagels and asked if we wanted to come back tomorrow and said they probably only have about 2 dozens left (which may have been true if she counted just the ones that were in the bins... but there were about another 5 dozens prepacked on their countertop.)  I knew most bagel shops close early and expected to have a less of a selection available to us, but I didn't expect her to ask me if we wanted to come back another day.  Maybe she was just being considerate... because she wanted us to have more to choose from?  But I just felt that wasn't the thing to say to customers that made their first trip there (with a coupon which made me feel a bit more uncomfortable). She must have known it was our first time there because only first time customers can use the coupon.  \n\nAnyways, I told her that we would see what they have left and go from there... and we were able to pick out the 2 dozen bagels and they still had about another dozen or so left in the bins alone.  I was thinking maybe she said that because they would have to reject other customers that came in after us if they ran out, but they were going to close very soon and they still had a good amount of bagels left.\n\nI wanted to see if she would offer to cut the bagels for me... since throwing them into a bagel cutter is way less work than me sitting at home and cutting 24 or so bagels, but unfortunately she didn't offer and I didn't ask since I just felt a little bit uncomfortable there.  Afterwards when I mentioned this to my mom she said maybe they don't have a slicer... which.... I doubt, but if that's the case I apologize for mentioning this at all.  The employee did offer to give us some freezer bags though, which was nice of her.\n\nAs for the bagels, I enjoyed the bagels... they tasted just fine.  I read some other reviews and some people said they were too light and didn't fill them up... and I can see why they say that, but I don't mind because I actually don't mind a lighter bagel.\n\nI would go back and grab some more bagels if my parents needed some when I'm in town, but my first experience wasn't exactly what I expected.",

Would go back again and probably request to be seated at a table Nick is serving because he was that awesome. \n\nAnd the foooood!!! We did the chef's tasting where we got to pick 3 starters, 2 entrees, 1 side, and a dessert that is portioned for two for $45 pp and WOW. Everything was the bomb - my fav was the smoked ribs and the mussels (the meatiest mussels we've had). We also had the octopus (delish), the burrata (creamy), the hanger steak (cooked to perfection), the crawfish Mac & cheese (tasty), and the ricotta dessert balls - HEAVEN! \n\nHad to share a lengthy review because we already can't wait to go back!!

For clarification, they said nothing about this when I was about to sign the contract. I even showed the inspector pictures of termites in my yard. Practically a scam.

Had the 16 oz ribeye but probably shoulda got the bone in filet.  The ribeye was juicy and marbled but the filet looked even better.  \n\nFor the sides, the spinach had a citrus type flavor which was different but good, and Brussels sprouts, gnocchi, the mash potatoes all great!  Probably the best part of the meal was the desserts.  Ordered a creme brulet which was good but saw the apple dessert creation and decided to order that too.  The desserts are are Flintstone style - ginourmous :). \n\nOverall a double thumbs up!  And best of all, right across the street from my hotel so no commute!",

They had two dining room areas and a courtyard.  We got a seat outside near the fountain but to get there we have to pass through the kitchen which was pretty neat.  I got bitten by mosquitoes 5 times that night but that's the disadvantage of sitting outside.   The service was creepily friendly.  They refilled all non-alcoholic drinks regularly and they had two people serve your entree so they arrive on the table at exactly the same time. \n\nThings we ordered:\nAngry Oysters - Fried oysters on top of a corn chowder.  This is pretty good.  The cajun seasoning overpowered the oysters though. \n\nShrimp stuffed with ham -  This tasted like a buffalo chicken wing.  The pickled onions and okra was amazing with the shrimp and ham.  Probably one of my favorites that night. \n\nSeafood Bisque - There was no seafood in it and a bit salty for my taste. \n\nWild Mushroom Gnocchi - Tons of mushrooms and flavors were good. \n\nSome kind of crusted fish - Really really good.  \n\nThat's all I can remember.",

He looks at each tree like a friend and makes cuts that are not only healthy for the long term growth of the tree but are also pleasing to the eye. It is rare to find someone with his knowledge and ability who can meet the needs of his customers with a love for his work like Jacob. His work ethic is admirable. He shows up on time, completes the work he says he will complete for that day, and thoroughly cleans up at the end of each day. He worked for a week on our property trimming 6 fan palms, one huge old oak tree, three smaller oaks, and cut a gigantic hedge that was higher than our roof and about to take over one whole side of our house. He also did a beautiful job on our neighbor's Canary Palm.  His prices are competitive with other tree companies (I got 4 bids). Jacob is also respectful of the neighbors asking permission to clean up on their lawns and making sure they were okay with the view from their side. It was a pleasure to work with him and I plan to use him for many more jobs.",

  "text": "Update - CLOSED? - Went on Oct 14, 2017.  Lights out, door locked.  No \"closed\" sign, but no one in the store.  Called them three times on Oct 28, no answer.\n\n-----  (ordered review) -----\n\nMy daughter was attending a middle-school fund raiser at a nearby Applebee's, so my son and I had to find a way to burn an hour of time.  I punched \"bagels\" into Yelp, and Brooklyn Bagels caught my eye.\n\nI grew up in Brooklyn, so the phrase \"Brooklyn Bagels\" has a very specific, almost sacred meaning to me.  Sure, I appreciate the appeal for any bagel restaurant to apply \"Brooklyn\" to their name - it's not legally-defined, and it improves business.\n\nThis place is the real deal.  I don't know exactly what makes bagels from Brooklyn so special, but out of all the bagel restaurants I've been to in Southampton / Willow Grove / Warminster / Hatboro / Horsham / Huntingdon Valley area, only this place nailed it.  The texture and flavor are perfect.  The New York-style menu spans much of the room.  The owner (I presume he was the owner) is friendly, and the sandwiches are excellent.\n\nThe ambiance isn't great, and seating is limited - but from what I recall of similar places in Brooklyn, that too is authentic.  \n\nI strongly recommend Brooklyn Bagels, and as you drive there, make a point of sticking your hand out the car window and flipping off any \"Manhattan Bagel\" franchises you pass on the way.",

First they sat us at a round booth that was really small for 6 people even though they had plenty of open tables. The server was pleasant enough but took a long time to come take our order. Salsa was pretty bland but cheese dip was good. Our food took forever to come out then when it did they didn't bring it all at once. And my sons nachos had sat under the warmer so long they were very soggy. And my daughters steak was super greasy. My taco salad was very good though. Just a mediocre experience and way overpriced compared to the average Mexican restaurant. To top it off the cashier didn't bother getting off his personal phone call to take my money.",

The Shrimp po boy is delicious and the portions are great! \n Although I have noticed that the staff is more concerned about not working/hanging out with each other than actually doing their jobs. \n\nOur last visit there was an absolute nightmare. We were seated but never waited on. After about 15 minutes I got up and went to the girl who sat us and asked who our waitress was. We finally got waited on and received our food. Although I have had the Shrimp Po boy at least 3 times prior, this time it was terrible. I have worked in the food industry for 11 years and could tell specifically that the oil desperately needed to be changed in the fryer. When this isn't done frequently it causes the food to taste burnt. \n\nThey were not very busy and about 5-6 of their employees were all sitting outside next to the bar just chilling while we received terrible service and food. \n\nI've read some of the other reviews and apparently this happens frequently. \n\nIf they could get their staff in order this place would be 4-5 stars.",

Only one movie to choose from, makes the decision easy. But even considering the higher cost and limited selection, this place is AMAZING!\n\nI really love the architecture and decor.

I would DREAM about their chocolate chip cookies and had to make my mama get me one whenever we rented a VHS. \n\n-Best Cookies (IMHO): Chocolate Chip, Heath Bar\n\n-MILKSHAKES! Their mint chocolate chip milkshakes are my personal favs. I usually ask them to do half whole, half fat-free milk in order to try and cut the calories. Still delish.\n\n-Careful of the employees! LOL. They're all high-school/college kids who are probably in the midst of their first employment so be patient and watch what they're doing so you can get what you ordered! The upside to this is that they can be very generous with the portions and sometimes dish out the extra milkshake in a side dish if they made too much (no extra charge! Be sure to tip well).\n\n-Try and get there or find out when the cookies are coming out fresh from the oven. I mean, this experience is DIVINE. Hot, melty, scrumptious cookies from Hope's are like none other.\n\n-Now that Hope's is attached to Peace A Pizza which actually used to be seriously good before they went mega-local-chain on us. Haven't even bothered getting a slice here in years but, from what I remembered, they went from amazing to mediocre to borderline bad. Sadville. A slice of White pizza and a milkshake used to be the best combo...\n\nOk. I think I've said my piece! Yay, Yelp!",

Go raw for as many courses as you can stand while you sit and watch a sunset fade into the horizon behind the marina. Wait longer for a seat on the upstairs patio unless you like sitting at the busy bar. Key advice: Don't get too plastered at The Endless Summer while you're waiting for a table. You might forget your keys at the hostess stand.",

  "text": "I've eaten cuban/carribean food all over the world, and El Cubanito is my favorite place ever.  I admit I'm fairly biased: I was one of their first customers when they opened in 1995, and they were my gateway into the world of east latin american cooking.  The brothers who ran the shop were always friendly to me and recently when I returned I saw that the same brother is still running the place, still serving *exactly* the same food.  The type of Cuban they cook is simple, homestyle cooking and I prefer the final product to the Versailles either in Miami or Los Angeles.  Beverages include a wide selection of cuban canned sodas (Materba, Ironbeer, Matey), great fruit smoothies/shakes, and Cuban Coffee.  Authentic Cuban decor features a wall of baseball bats signed by various Cuban players and a very unflattering effigy of a skeletal Castro for those who are unclear on the proprietor's political views.",

The venue is so gorgeous; there's a lot of beautiful art, so you don't have to worry about decorating. \n\nMark and Joe are wonderful to work with, and made the whole planning process really easy on us. (This was a huge deal to me, since we were planning our wedding from Seattle.) They were very helpful and quick to respond, and made our celebration spectacular! \n\nThe food was really delicious, and our guests were very happy. I also love the flow of the place, and that we could use multiple levels. Everything went so smoothly; we all had a blast! I could not have imagined a more perfect venue for us. I would definitely recommend the Randall Gallery to all St. Louis brides, and for other events as well!",

My wife and I have seen a few movies here so far this summer, and the prices are reasonable ($7 for a matinee, $11.50 for the mark up on a 3D film after 4). As a tall guy, the seating is very comfortable, with plenty of leg room and reclining chairs. It's not fancy, but it certainly does a good job and seems to be a pretty well kept secret in the area. If you live down river of downtown, you should definitely consider a trip out here for summer movie enjoyment.",

Our order was taken promptly and the staff quickly advised us about the menu in regard to vegetarian and gluten free items.  Amazing iced-tea (unsweet tea mixed with their yummy housemade strawberry lemonade).  I enjoyed one of the best salads ever...the Pepper Patch with an amazing dressing, roasted jalapeño vinaigrette.  The side of roasted vegetables was tasty!  Our son often orders quesadillas when we eat out and he rated the Veggie Quesadilla at Urban Cookhouse as topnotch!  The crowning glory...the strawberry lemonade milkshakes.  We enjoyed dining on the outdoor patio in the shade.  The staff was excellent, attentive, helpful and friendly.

For ramen lovers out there then, this restaurant should be somewhat of a nice surprise.  Except that it's really not all that.  It's not terrible, but i certainly wouldn't characterize this as good ramen.\n\nThe broth is mediocre and lacks depth of flavor.  The noodles are even worse - it's like they threw in spaghetti noodles and called it ramen.\n\nThe char sui is flavored fine but is a little tough.\n\nSince there's really no other ramen joints, it might satisfy your ramen craving.

I had bacon, egg, and cheese, and my boyfriend had scrapple.  However, after trying the bagels on two different occasions I have to admit they are just not that good. They don't have the right texture. They are almost crumbly and fall apart as you are eating them. They seem more like bread. It's slightly chaotic inside and can be confusing to order. I would come back for a breakfast sandwich or to try some of their other breakfast selections since they are local. I would not order bagels from them, as I much prefer the bagels from another place.",

We had a Groupon that we bought for only $11 and we got four separate flights for each of us. It was easy to go right up to the bar and instantly work out the details of the Groupon and get rolling with our drinks.\nThe atmosphere at the bar is great. It has an open store front, rather than a door, so it's very light and breezy inside, as well the decor is simple yet very playful and nice, with many table games to play while you're there.\nWe were also able to check in on yelp and get a pint of beer of our choosing for only $4 or so, which was very nice! We took these drinks to the back where they had a classic game set up, Mario Kart on the Nintendo 64! It was very fun sitting down and playing Mario Kart and letting more time pass than we realized.\nThe drink choices covered most of what a person might want while out and they were all hand crafted, mostly local beers, which was awesome. My favorite was the pelican blonde, but the sour beer is definitely worth a try as well. This is definitely a company that promotes the drink local ideology. All in all, the atmosphere was amazing, and so were the drinks and the deals. We ended up spending more time than we realized here because it was a great experience! Definitely recommend stopping by here.",

All the seats are 'ground floor': there is no balcony. There didn't seem like there was a bad seat in the whole place. The rows are pretty narrow though, so it's a pain crawling over people's knees to get to your mid-section seats. But once you are seated, all's good. The sound and the stage views are excellent. \n\nI saw a Broadway production here and was impressed by the quality.",

They can be eaten outside in the covered patio.\n\nIf possible, try to visit Mazzaro's during a weekday. Mazzaro's is always a madhouse during Saturday.\n\nMazzaro's is a great place to find normal ingredients for Italian cooking and hard-to-find items like guanciale. Ciao!!",

  "text": "I bought the perfect dress for graduation except it was way to big (and I already got the smallest size). It was a pretty inexpensive dress and I was willing to get it altered. It needed taken in as well as additional padding on the front. She had me put it on and then she put pins in it where it needed altered and added the padding. Then I changed and she wrote up a card with my name, phone number, and price. I was in and out in no time!\nSince I've never had alternations done before on a dress I didn't know what to expect price wise. She told me it would be $67 and she asked if I wanted it done. I thought it was a little pricey at first but after doing some research it's a pretty competitive price.\nAs for the location it's a very small and cozy shop with two dressing rooms and one pedestal and mirror in the center. I think the couple lives above the shop because their two dogs were behind the counter. I could see all the articles of clothing hung in the back room-- make sure you come well before you need something finished because she has a lot of work ahead of her!\nWhen I went to pick it up I rang the bell and a man found my dress and rang me up. I thought it was weird that I didn't try it on before paying but I tried it on when I got home and it's absolutely perfect. I can't even tell some places where she took it in.\nA couple things to note: they do NOT accept credit cards and you must be willing to wait a considerable amount of time before picking up your clothing item(s). I said I would like to have the dress in exactly two weeks and she agreed that it could easily be done in that time frame because it is a short dress. Yet she wrote on her card the last possible date I wanted it with no extra information. Also I never got a call when it was finished so I picked it up on the day that she wrote on the card. I feel like this place could receive plenty of bad reviews just because people weren't able to get their items in soon enough.\nSo overall this place has terrible customer service but amazing results. I would have other clothing fixed here.",

Walking through Center City, I came across this unique French bakery offering a range of pastries from croissants to flourless chocolate cake.

The employees were very kind and helped me select a few pastries that met my dietary restrictions.\n\nThe taste of the pastries was between 3.5 or 4 out of 5 while the customer service was 5/5.

  "text": "LOVED this place when it was Tijuana Flats - used to go there at least once a week and was so excited when I heard they would be reopening under a different name. Then they kept pushing back the opening, first the end of January, then sometime February, then late February, and finally March 9th (even though they said they would be open March 8th when called).\n\nEven though it's under the same management with the same staff with similar food, it just isn't the same. For one thing, they've given the place an \"upscale\" makeover, complete with Apple computers as registers and taken simple things like napkin dispensers off the tables. If you were a fan of the cheesy double stack tacos, you're out of luck - they must have been a Tijuana Flats-only item.\n\nMy husband and I ordered our food and 20 minutes later, we were still waiting. Someone came over and asked our name because apparently the order never went through (so much for fancy technology). Then 10 minutes later, our order came out but it wasn't entirely correct. When we pointed this out, all we got was a blank stare. No one ever apologized for the wait or the mistake in the order. The food itself was just ok, but that could be because they threw it together in a hurry. All in all, it was a pretty disappointing experience after waiting two months for the reopening.",

First, when I walked up and saw the open air cafe I was blown away by how cool this placed look and was stoked to see there was a line b/c that generally means that you are in store for a treat when locals take the time to wait for fare.  \n\nThen after waiting in line for a while it occurred to me that maybe the line was due to the comically slow service.  I waited about 10 minutes in a line of about 6 people before putting my order in.  I considered a few times going somewhere else, but decided I should wait it out.\n\nFinally, I had arrived and was able to place my order.  I got an Ethiopian blend coffee and their extra thick sourdough toast with almond butter.  Both were totally worth the wait.

Also I ordered something called croissant French toast which I had never had before but combines my two favorite things. It was good but one of the pieces was completely undercooked\n\nI would love to blame it on the fact that it was busy but it really wasn't. Atmosphere is better than the food on this particular day",

  "text": "This dogtown staple focuses on some of our favorite bar food items and does them all well.  It's very clear that this place has grown over the years.  The front bar area has a cool old fashioned feel.  As you meander into the adjoining rooms, you can tell that they were added on at a later date.  They don't have that same warmth.  The patio all the way to the back is totally different than the front area.  The two walls are made of clear garage doors.  You feel like you're outside without being in the elements.  And there are TV's everywhere.  \n\nFor food, we had the hot wings... perfect.  A gyro plate... flavorful meat, and super soft pita bread.  And a burger... large portion, cooked to order, with a slight char.  On the downsides, both salads that we had were soaked with dressing.  In the future, I'll request mine on the side.  But the dressings themselves were super yummy and tasted like they were made in-house.  \n\nService is ok... The 3 girls we dealt with seemed gruff but got the job done... almost Flo or Rossaneish.  I think one of them could take me in a fight.",

The outdoor seating area is delightful and quite spacious for downtown Philly. My puggle and I sat comfortably on a bench (her underneath on the floor) and were immediately served our own water (hers in a doggy bowl). We enjoyed a relaxed brunch with well balanced  & free flowing coffee and a friendly (and cute) server. The eggs florentine was tasty and the perfect size. They seem to chose healthier options here like wheat toast and sweet potatoes which I love. We will definitely return possibly for wine because I LOVE wine!",

Their lattes and cappuccinos are also fantastic. You can get gelato in your latte and that is their signature item! The service is always fantastic and the prices are reasonable. You can get three scoops in a small and their flavor choices are vast. The price is about $5 which is reasonable since they pile the gelato as much as they can. I highly recommend the Mediterranean salted carmel, the amaretto chocolate chip and the amarena cherry. Those three flavors together are a tasty combo. Although the hazelnut, coconut, baileys and wedding cake are also amazing. Too many to name so come here for the best gelato in town and see for yourself.",

We were quickly seated at the most perfect table for two outside, next to the little garden. Both Ted and Katie were nice enough to stop by and chat, even giving us a few peppers from the garden. \n\nI had the Asparagus Pizza, which was delicious. The crust is a bit chewy, in the best way possible. My boyfriend had the Basil Tagliatelle and loved every bite. I recommend the Sgroppino to drink. They are quick to serve, but it would be nice to get a little fresh bread and OO while ya wait or with the pasta, just in case there is left over sauce :)\n\nI loved the artichoke salad from KP and was disappointed to see it was a whopping $14. The pizzas aren't terribly large, but had to enlist some help to finish it. So if you want to share a pizza, you might need a salad or a small plate as well. Katie's isn't easy on the pocket book, but it's great for a treat!",

I ordered a burrito because I decided to play it safe because I mean being a Mexican restaurant, how do you mess up a burrito? But I spoke too soon. As I received my burrito and cut it in half, I realized that it did not look very appetizing at all. It was very dry and the flavor was definitely lacking even though it was stuffed with ingredients. I definitely will not order it again. However, before eating the entree, my friend and I ordered their special nachos and I absolutely loved it. It was a great start to the meal. Drinks were okay as well. Nothing special.\n\nI'm not sure how likely it will be that I return here because I've tasted better Mexican restaurants.

We had a gluten free pizza, and wanted something different. We had prociutto, fig spread and cheese on our pizza. It was very tasty.  A personal pizza is a good size for two people so that you can save room for their amazing nutella dessert pizza. Their prices are even better when you go on creative loafing and get a gift certificate there. Can you believe our bill came out to 1.50. Yes I swear, it was awesome.\nParking is not the greatest in Downtown Tampa. I really don't like driving around the area, but you will end up paying a small price on the meter.  \nYou can sit outside and enjoy fresh air since the outside is mostly shaded, as well as bring your dog. \nIt was definitely a great afternoon.

I found myself wishing I had my daughters technician, who was gentle and took her time. There were no other customers while we were there either, so there was no reason to rush. I'll be back though!",

And the ozark burger is to die for!!!! \n\nButtttt I will never go again!!!!! I cannot stand the prissy blonde server!!!! She is soooooo rude!!!!! She treated me and my best friend like crap when we went in!!!!!\n\nIt started by us 2 girls goin out for lunch. At first I ordered a cherry sprite. Which I get every time I go. She tells me that they dont have a full bar that they only had a couple items downstairs! Lol that's a lie and I knew she was just bein lazy and didn't wanna walk to the bar and get me the drink I wanted. Ok that's fine.. She didn't tell my friend about the menu, the sodas, the sauces or help her with any of her order!!! So I of corse had to. Since I had became a regular there. We got our food. She was still rude, ignoring us, not refilling our drinks or checking on us or anything! \n\nIt didn't really bother me at the time.. It was just one bad service expierence at the range.. So whatever.\n\nA few weeks later I brought my mom and pregnant sister. I got the same waitress again!!!! Fml!!!!\n\nFirst I ordered a Cherry coke! She tries to tell me they didn't have it!!!!! What!!! I was like,\"well its on the menu!!!!\" and she got snotty and said she would check!!!! Omg! She just don't wanna walk downstairs!! Again!!!! Geez!    \n\nWe got out drinks and rushed my family through out order! Didn't offer and charged us all for catchup!!!!! For one the fries come with the side of sauce!!!! And we had to pay for it!!!! That's bs! She ignored us, no refills, she had an attitudes and when it came time for our check she put it as far away from out reach as possible!!!!

  "text": "I recently rented from Alamo while in Tampa, FL from 6-16 through 6-21.  I booked the car through the \"name your own price\" deal on Priceline.   \n\nI arrived to Tampa and went directly to the rental counter, which was in the airport and rather convenient.  There was a short line, but the person at one of the other counters (I believe Thrifty) had no line and was able to start checking me in.  This process was rather easy as well.  The agent gave me instructions to go to the ramp and select a car in the compact section.  \n\nWhen I arrived at the section I had an option of 3/4 vehicles.  I was looking for one with a trunk, so I only had a 1/2 options.  Pick the one that looks newer, and am on my way out when I notice there is no cruise control.  I planned on doing a fair amount of driving, so this was important to me (and something I never considered would be missing).  I parked the car and check all the others---nothing.  So I went back to the counter to see if there are any vehicles that have this option (told them I didn't mind downgrading if needed).  \n\nI was told I would need to upgrade my vehicle 2 categories for $11/day.  This seemed pretty unreasonable to me, so I declined and went back to get another car. Luckily, there was a compact car with cruise control that had magically appeared.  It was a hatchback, but had a trunk cover, so it worked.  Left the lot (relatively easy) and was on my way.  \n\nThe return was actually very pleasant, aside from the difficulty I had finding a gas station (that may have been on me).  The employee checking my car is was nice, quick and thorough.  \n\nOver the course of the rental, my biggest complaint was the car had no power. I was driving alone with one backpack and no additional weight, and the car was constantly struggling.  I had a Hyundai Accent (I don't think I would put that in the compact category, but I may be wrong).\n\nOverall I was disappointed with the fact I was lied to by a manager, in order to try and pressure me into a sale ($11 upgrade), and felt the car was below my expectations.  I chose this path over an offsite agency (fox, economy).  Alamo was twice the price, and the service and car weren't much better.  I say that having 2 fairly good experiences and cars using Fox from Vegas to LAX, and have no experience with them in FL.  Realistically they should get a 2.5 star, but they could do much better.",

Came in and bought a dress and then went back in the store five minutes later realizing I wanted a different dress. I asked to exchange it and there was a $7 difference. The girl would not refund the $7 even though I had bought the dress 5 minutes before that. I have worked in retail and a small boutique just like that with the same return policy and always returned customers the money if they just bought an item. I even told the girl that I don't live there and would have no use to the $7 store credit and she still wouldn't refund my money. I was never informed of this return policy when buying the dress in the first place. After searching around for something to buy I ended up picking out a piece of jewelry. A sign outside said all jewelry 10% off. When the girl rang me up she didn't even give me the 10% discount...I had to remind her. Such poor customer service and would never advise anyone to shop there.",

So, this place has a lot of beer. They don't have the \"mainstream\" beers per sé. But what they do have is an amazing selection. One that would make you lose it. They do have their version of Blue moon or shock top. DON'T get that. Tastes like bitter old lemonade. Everything else is pretty good. They will have some private beers.

Their cheese connoisseur is very friendly and knowledgeable and she let us try some of their cheeses and also explained to us some of the cheese/food/wine pairing. Service is awesome and servers are really friendly! \n\nThe location is also perfect! It's far away from touristy State Street but still has the perfect Santa Barbara vibe to it.

Check sent on June 11th, payment processed on July 2nd.  Late charge of $5.  Sent in replacement check prior to old check clearing and placed a stop payment on old check.  They then process the first check almost a month after it was received and charge a $30 fee because of the stop payment that was placed on it for not being processed timely.  Nobody will help and they totally stonewall your ability to escalate to a CEO or senior manager (we can't release that information... fill out your complaint online).

  "text": "Damn. This place rocked my world. If you know me, you know I'm obsessed with Chinese food. \n\nIt was busy on a Saturday night, but we only waited 15 minutes for a table for 4. The table ordered: mala chicken, moo shu pork, shrimp with snow peas and mushrooms, and hunan tofu. I only tried the chicken and pork, but both of the other dishes looked amazing, got rave reviews, and the plates were all clean by the end. I could see that the shrimp was cooked to absolute perfection.\n\nNext time I go back (oh, there WILL BE a next time, for sure) it will be really hard not to get the mala chicken again. Menu listed it as very spicy, and while it had a kick it definitely wasn't Han Dynasty spicy. The morsels of chicken were so tender and fried beautifully - there was a very light coating that provided just enough crispness. The sauce was surprisingly complex, with notes of sichuan peppercorn, black vinegar, honey, garlic, and chiles. The portion was quite large but I ended up eating it all. Well, F kept stealing pieces but I guess I did offer to share both dishes we ordered... Next time he's getting his own.\n\nThe moo shu pork was OK, but moo shu isn't really my thing. I will say it's by far the best moo shu I've had on a very short list. Loved the seaweed (?) and glass noodles; it was very fresh-tasting.\n\nHousemade pickles to start and chocolate-dipped fortune cookies with orange wedges at the end. What could be better? Some reviewers have complained about the portion sizes but I thought they were a reasonable size. You're not getting two pounds of food like at a cheap Chinese takeout joint, but the food is infinitely better, fresher, and made with higher quality ingredients. Worth paying a few extra dollars for.\n\nDinner entrees are a bit pricey for typical Chinese food, but on par with what you might see at the local Thai places ($14-$17 per entree). Certainly still affordable by Main Line standards!",

Tried to call for carryout, the young woman who answered the phone asked me to repeat myself six times, and then asked me if the Phoenix roll was cooked or not???  Apparently, the employees do not have responsibility for knowing the menu. Nice job management!  Your training program is clearly paying off.  I guess we'll call for delivery instead.  I wonder what restaurant is going to lease that space after Hiro's goes out of business (again) in the near future.\n\n- Another lost customer",

Let me start off by saying that the outside seating has such a great and chill ambience. It's definitely a place to get dressed up for! The server brought us some prosecco to start off our celebration, which was very sweet. We ordered the spicy tuna on crispy rice, French onion soup, Caesar salad, and NY Steak! Everything was on point and delish! The Caesar salad was made with anchovies in the dressing and even tho I don't like the taste of anchovies, the salad was light and refreshing! The creme brûlée dessert was the best I've ever had! Highly recommend! The one negative thing I have to add is that the water tasted like dirt. Another table complained about the same thing!

  "text": "We have been going to Bloomingdale Animal Hospital for as long as we have had dogs, 10+ years, for their low prices and location convenience. But after the way they treated an emergency situation, we will NEVER go there again. I don't know if it was lack of education on their part or lack of care, but either way, I will never trust them with my animals again. We have a miniature Dachshund who is 10 years old and one morning woke up screaming crying in pain, I rushed her to the vet right away and they took blood work, exams, and gave me anti inflammatory medicine and pain killers. After paying an arm and a leg, they told me they have no idea what's wrong with her and to check back in after a week. A few days later her pain was getting worse and not better, so I rushed her back in to get re-examined. After paying another arm and a leg, they told me it could be cancer but they are not completely sure, and she might have to be put down and just upped the medication and sent me on my way. Thank goodness my Dachshund got worse over the weekend, because this place was unavailable so I rushed her to the ER Vet Blue Pearl, where within minutes they diagnosed her with a COMMON DACHSHUND DISEASE CALLED IVDD. They immediately got her on the correct medication and treatment process and within weeks my dachshund was better, happy, and healthy. BLOOMINGDALE ANIMAL HOSPITAL TOLD ME SHE MIGHT DIE- and if they would have accurately diagnosed her the first time she would have been better weeks earlier instead of sitting in unimaginable pain. They either didn't care about my dachshunds life and wanted the extra money, didn't know a common disease which worries me about their overall education, or didn't take the time to genuinely care about my dachshunds pain. DO NOT GO TO THEM, YOUR DOGS CARE IS WORTH PAYING SLIGHTLY MORE SOMEWHERE ELSE.",

  "text": "We bought the membership program for plumbing, electrical and air conditioning. They would come out periodically to check, but it was only just an excuse to try to sell us new and unnecessary parts. \n\nAfter calling to cancel the $35 per month charge, I was told I had to send a written request by email or regular mail, and it would take 30 days for it to be cancelled. Of course that means they get another payment out of me. \n\n30 days?  Sleezeb. Look at the reviews of this company both here and at BBB. \n\nIN ANSWER TO YOUR COMMENT. \n\nWhen we had the condenser fan stopped due to lightening in our air conditioning, we again had to listen to a selling speel before he would replace it. This was a unit that was less than 5 yrs old because it was still under warranty for the original installation. \n\nHigh pressure sale. Greatly inflated prices \n\nYou came out once about our heater during your annual checkup in 2016.  We were told there was a tiny gas leak which he fixed after first telling us all about the expensive systems that we should buy before fixing it. The heater is still working fine in 2018.  Plus he looked at our air intake on the heating/cooling intake. Found a birds nest, but he said he was unable to get it out, they suggested punching a hold in the side wall for a new intake system. I went to hardware store, bought a snake, and cleaned it out myself  \n\nTake a look at the BBB reviews of this company.",

  "text": "Went here for lunch on a weekday.\n\nService: Very friendly waitress and server. Seemed slightly understaffed when more people started trickling in for lunch but were never rude and reasonably fast. \n\nSpace:\nSeems like it's in an old KFC or some other fast food place? They still have the old drive in window up although I'm still not sure if they're using it or not...small space when the rush starts coming in. About 8-9 seats at the bar max, three 4-6 person tables and around 5-6 extra seats against one of the walls. Was able to grab a table but a group behind us had to wait a while for another. They do treat it like a full service restaurant though, waiter/ess has to seat you so no going to grab a seat yourself. \n\nFood: I had half the fried chicken, she had the chicken po boy, also split spiced tots. Fried chicken was very fresh. Breading is thick, very interesting spicy and sweet flavor which I really liked. They have a couple table sauces which go well with the flavor. She said chicken po boy was great. Spiced tots were unique with great flavor but my mouth was a little overwhelmed by all the chicken. I had a Southern Peach. Drink was well mixed, they don't skimp on the liquor. \n\nWould go back again, might try some fried nugz next time.",

  "text": "Be prepared to wait a long time... But worth it!\n\nThe best Ortho docs in the Tampa area.  It's so nice to meet a doctor who is not in a hurry to \"put you under the knife\",   I have arthritis in my knees, pretty badly, and they are doing everything they can to buy me time without having to do a knee replacement.  Staff is friendly and kind, and the PA and residents they train here have all been awesome.  I would highly recommend Dr.Bernasek if you are having trouble with your knees.  He's extremely kind, calm, and compassionate,  He also takes the time to talk to you and explain things, sometimes even leaving with a little hug,  And he does not order unnecessary testing\n\nNow, this is a HUGE practice with several locations.  And for some reason always run behind time.  When I saw Dr. Bernasek in December, I waited over 2 hours.  This time I had an appointment with his PA who gives the injections \"so I won't have to wait so long\". Well my appointment was at 11:00am but I was not called in until after 2pm.  That is ridiculous.  The PA was very apologetic about the wait, but I still gave him \"what for\" about it.  How can you get 3 hours behind in the morning?  This is definitely the biggest drawback of this practice.  I  do have to say they did bring around bottles water and packets of peanut butter crackers for us, which was a nice thing, but still did not make up for such a long wait\n\nBut, I have great confidence in my PA and Dr.  They don't rush me when I'm with them and they genuinely seem to care.  When it comes to my health, I want the best, and even with these long waits, I have the best.  \n\nMinus a star for waiting time.",

It is off site and it seems as if they only have one shuttle to pick you up form the airport. After 2 phone calls upon arrival and 35 minutes of waiting at the shuttle pickup area, the driver finally showed with a van that was full of other customers. I then squeezed in and sat on the floor for the 10 minute ride. \nI don't like judging a book by its cover but upon arrival, you 2nd guess your decision right away after seeing the building and the area.  If you don't get mugged by someone on the street or 7 eleven next door, one of the guys \"cleaning\" the cars outside under a makeshift canapoy will do it.  \n\nAnyways, once you get through the painfully slow line inside, the customer service was decent and the guy who checked me in was courteous and took the time to ask how our trip was going. Explained my frustrations with getting to their facility and he understood, did nothing beyond saying he was sorry about it though.\n\nOnce I finally got to the van I had rented and paid an additional $50 for a car seat, the van looked like it had been ridden hard and put away wet! There was not one panel without a dent, scratch or gauge.  This was ironic as the person who checked me in made it very clear that I should take the extra insurance coverage as I would be charged for an minor dents or dings on the vehicle. It wasn't vacuumed and the convicts \"cleaning\" consisted of spraying it off with a garden hose. \n\nSave yourself a headache when renting a vehicle @ TPA and rent form one of the companies on-site at the airport.  Any savings you think you might get form one of these 2nd rate rental car companies is not worth it, TRUST ME.",

  "text": "I visited this restaurant for my birthday on Wednesday with my sister and mother.  When we entered the restaurant, we waited. Although there was no line of customers to be greeted and seated.  The hosts were not at their posts and the employees assisting customers at the cheesecake case did not acknowledge us. When the hosts finally arrived to seat us. They did not welcome us and ushered us to the front of the restaurant and/or bar area.  My family is African American and the reason why I am noting this is that me and my family were greeted with cold and unwelcome stares from the Caucasian employees at the restaurant which is unacceptable behavior.  The Caucasian female initially assigned to our table acted like she did not want to serve us so her co-worker, a person of color, offered to do so.  After we were seated, we ordered lemonades. The rims of the glasses were covered in sugar although we had not ordered margaritas or alcoholic beverages. This could have been very problematic as my sister has diabetes.  I informed the server or waiter that it was my birthday and ordered a cheeseburger with fries.  When the food finally arrived, the bun on my burger was charred. The outside of the burger was burnt and the inside was raw.  The waiter apologized as he had not even bothered to ask me how I wanted my burger cooked i.e. rare, medium, well done.  He took the hamburger back while I hungrily waited for him to reappear.  He eventually returned after my sister and mother were finished with their meals with a burnt burger that was too burnt for consumption.  It felt and tasted like they had just cooked the old burger even longer.  I informed our server about the second burnt burger and he brought the manager who wanted to know if I wanted to give it a third try????  I declined the offer and ordered soft chicken tacos instead.  My sister's meal was gumbo with cheddar sauce???  Anyone familiar with this cuisine knows that it should never be made with cheese.  My experience at this establishment was horrible to say the  least. I have visited this restaurant in the past albeit years ago and the service and food had been excellent. I often referred to cheesecake factory as my favorite restaurant and so I was very disappointed and ashamed that I had recommended that we celebrate here.  Neither me nor my family or any family of color deserves to be treated as described at this chain restaurant.  All they will remember is how badly we were treated and the sub-par quality of the food.  I agree that the cheesecake is now \"so so\" and/or average.  We had wasted so much time at the restaurant that we decided not to proceed with our planned shopping trip and simply returned home.",

Hold your horses, make a reservation and head on over.\n\nFirst, to be honest, the atmosphere is just OK. When we first walked in, it felt like we were walking into a funeral home. It was dark and very dated.\n\nThe $35 dinner included fries and garlic bread. We told the server no fries for us please (more room for the crab!). They forgot and brought over fries anyway. They took them away. I ordered their version of an iced tea. I don't know what they brought over, but it wasn't an iced tea. Then they brought out the garlic bread, which unfortunately tasted stale and had very little flavor.  After a bite or two, we decided to pass on that too.\n\nFinally, the crab!  You can start with a plate with 2 large crabs, cleaned and split into two. You have a choice of Old Bay, garlic or plain. I started with Old Bay for the first found, but it was too salty for me. Next two rounds were plain. All the crab was juicy and meaty and sweet - just what I was looking for.\n\nThey do provide crab crackers, but to get the most meat, I highly recommend bringing your own seafood picks and.... my secret weapon... tiny sharp scissors!  Easier to cut through the legs where the shell is thin and you can get out a perfectly unmolested lump of meat that way.",

The fries were just the right level of crispy, and that jalapeno cheese sauce was to die for.\n\nAlso had the Tiger's Blood, which was a nice sweet treat.\n\nThe service rubbed me the wrong way initially, but our server was very attentive and apologetic when he realized one of the burgers in our group had cheddar on it when the girl who ordered it explicitly asked for it to be left off.\n\nIt is pretty cold inside, so make sure to bring a light jacket.",

We have had 3 cats in their care at all times and unfortunately all three have had illnesses.  They always take the time to answer all our questions and give very open and honest feedback.  One of our cats was diabetic and was truly a \"problem child\" but Dr. Sharz and Dr. Sandy never gave up on her and went above and beyond trying to treat her.  Unfortunately, she got cancer and we had to put her to sleep.  But I know they gave her another 4 great years before the cancer hit just by being so willing to work with her diabetes and educate us as a family on how to care for her.  With the 2 of our cats that had to be put sleep, they we treated with such love and compassion, as was our family.  Every member of the staff has a passion for his/her job and it shows.  I will never go to another vet and highly recommend them.  Their name is so appropriate, because they truly are \"My Best Friend\" for my animals and for me when it comes to their care.",

After owning several true religion jeans i purchased a pair from this store that bagged out after wearing for just over an hour and it started to lose shape. I called the store and explained the issue and advised that i removed the tags to wear the jeans but needed to return or exchange them due to them bagging out after such a short time. I was advised there is no way to return or exchange jeans once the tag is removed and i was referred to read the return policy on the receipt. I again explained i own several jeans the same size and have not had this issue before . How would i know the jeans would not fit so poorly unless I wore them? $130 is too much to not be able to return of something does not work. Another true religion store accepted the jeans and could not believe it was so stretchy.  They explained there are quality differences in jeans made for outlet locations.",

  "text": "I was always a Neiman Marcus fan, but after visiting this Nordstrom, I haven't used my NM card is almost a year. The vibe at Nordstrom is younger and the sales help is just wonderful. Many of the sales associates at NM just stare at you with a \"can't be bothered\" look on their faces. If I'm spending $500 on a dress, I'd like someone to at least show me to a dressing room! The friendliness level at Nordstrom blows Neiman Marcus out of the water. And Nordstrom has some of the same brands and many of the younger brands that NM does not. Since the redesign of the King of Prussia store, this is my favorite place to shop. Sales associates have called around the country to find dresses in a size I've needed. And they've mailed pieces to my home at no charge when it wasn't in stock at the time. They've sent \"Thank you notes\" to my home when I've shopped there. \n\nMy only two complaints: They don't have a full sized spa like the Nordstrom in Chicago (which is just wonderful!) and the service in the cafe is painfully bad. The food is delicious, but the workers are neglectful and don't know how to properly serve a table. They have a bit of an attitude, as well. I actually complained to the manager at the cafe and he admitted to knowing his staff is not up to par and offered me a free lunch because of a bad experience I'd had. When I went in for the lunch, he was not in that day, but had obviously left a note about me coming. The staff was snotty and made every effort to make me uncomfortable. I don't go there for lunch anymore (although I've had great experiences at the restaurants at other Nordstrom stores). But there are plenty of places to eat in the mall (actually Neiman's restaurant is fantastic). I still go to Nordstrom for almost all of my shopping.",

They messed up our rooms, lost reservations until I called with confirmation numbers, didn't have rooms ready in time (hours later) when i called to confirm the day before. Were extremely rude and unapologetic for any of the mistakes that were made. Charged us $150 to take wedding photos at stratus before it was opened and then tried to kick us out 5 minutes after being there. The bar wouldn't give my of my bridal party water. They tried to make my brother wait in Stratus's line to get to his room, which was on the 10th floor. Everything was VERY VERY VERY expensive and the amenities and service VERY poor. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone with the OMI next door. Don't fall for the fancy wall paper at the hotel monaco. Not to mention the bartenders at the red owl tavern were rude to all my guests and family members.

So it has more items than regular Walmart. \n\nStart with grocery. They have bakery, fresh produce, deli, meat and seafood, frozen section and many more. Price is acceptable. I like the Parmesan chicken wing. This is my favorite in the deli section. I like the cream pop at the frozen section. They do have Ahi tuna grade fillet. It good for seared or sushi. \n\nDaily product includes clothing, sport items, electronic, art and craft, bicycle, jewelry, and more. I like the most is their eye glass center, you can get good pair of glass with lesser price with insurance cover. The pant and shock is my frequent item. \n\nThe pharmacy has the beauty product I need, it also has my daily care product like tooth paste, shampoo and mouthwash. Well.

  "text": "5 stars for Michaya, 2 for the boutique itself. The girls at the front desk are not that inviting when you walk in the shop. They didn't greet me or asked if I needed help with anything. I had to go up there to let her know I had an appointment. They also misinformed me about the \"50% off first fill\" deal when I called to reschedule my 2nd appointment. I understand the policy, but then I expect them to do their research before actually confirming the deal with the client. When I asked about it while I was paying and told them it was confirmed prior to the appointment, they pretty much implied that I was lying because it was Lara who rescheduled me and she \"would never say that\". First of all, money isn't an issue for me so whether I pay the full price or not isn't a big deal. Just maybe next time, learn to acknowledge and apologize for the misinformation then explain the policy without making your clients feel like you are questioning their integrity. \n\nAnyway, booked my first appt with Michaya 2 weeks ago using Groupon. This was my first time ever getting lash extensions so I didn't really know what to expect. I liked how she asked me questions to help me decide what length and style I should go with. We decided to go with natural looking lashes, then she said we can change it up on our follow up appt if I wanted a more dramatic look. The process took an hour and the whole time I was very relaxed. The ambience in the room and her music was very soothing. She told me what to expect when we were done, which is pretty much to expect a lot of shedding. She also told me to book my follow up in 2 weeks. \n\nI had my follow up yesterday and by the time I got to the boutique, I felt like I only had 25% of the extensions left. She said my eyelashes are sparse so the lashes aren't holding on as much as they should be. So this time around, she used a stronger glue and we went for longer, more bolder look.  \n\nIt's been 24 hours since my appt and so far I've only shed 1 eyelash! Compared to the first time, where I lost about 10 on each eye. \n\nSo far so good. I enjoy getting them done with Michaya. She's kind, professional, educated and she really does care about what you want.",

  "text": "These are cheap studio apartments in the heart of Fat City. If you require lace doilies under your tea, these are not for you. But they have several good points:\n1) Cheap\n2) Convenient to shopping, Lakeside mall, the Causeway and I-10\n3) Cheap... and small, about 500 sq. feet\n4) Well managed. Anytime I have had a complaint, like a leaky faucet, bugs (! I hate bugs!!) or a car abandoned in the parking lot, it has been answered quickly and courteously. \n5) They rent month-to-month.\n\nThere are about 60 units in the building but the room-to-room insulation is good. Above and below, not so good. With so many tenants, one disgusting pig with dishes in the sink can attract roaches, who will roam the building looking for other opportunities. I sealed all the water pipe and electrical openings, then reported the problem. DA exterminating came by the very next day, no problems since then.  \nFree water, laundry room on the lowest floor. Many but not all of the apartments have a wall or baffle with built-in bookshelves. So your bed is behind the wall and it's a little more like a real apartment.\nA nice feature for those of us who survived Katrina is that the building is on stilts, it is raised with parking underneath. \nAll in all you get what you pay for. I resisted bringing my girlfriend over for the longest time because I was not real proud of the place. But thanks to the Summit, I have money in the bank and plans to play in the stock market. (If I am still living here in a few years, you will know how well that worked out.)",

The omelets are very customizable, and they are quite large.  It came with a side of toast, and a choice of fruit, home fries, or french fries (??).  It was around $6-7  The delivery guy appeared to be college age and was very friendly to be delivering food in the morning when everyone else was just waking up.\n\nDefinitely a place worth trying especially if you're a student who's got a long night ahead of you.",

I always leave my original post.  That being said they more than compensated and I'm feeling the red carpet service. \nOriginal post:\nI work at a call center, all calls are taken care of that came in before closing.  Not here.  I called In at 11 after 7.  They close at 6 on Fridays, but yelp says they close at 10pm, no where on there mobile site do they post their hours and you don't know their office is closed until you give up and leave a voicemail.  I would have left a voicemail 5 min into the call if they started with they were currently closed.  Additionally the message never changed, still told me I could continue to hold.  I am not feeling the red carpet service.  I hope that we can move on from this and I get the service that everyone raves about.  But for today they are at a one  star",

I don't think the employees knew I could understand what they were saying. I was a walk in and they were pleasant about it. However I asked if they had any special spa pedicures which most nail salons have. The employees at other salons usually try to upsell you to a spa as well. However I was met with looks as if I was crazy, they also initially said they had 2 different kinds of spa pedicures then changed it to a single special spa pedicure. They also stated that it would get \"complicated\" if I started picking and choosing in another langu\n\nI stayed for my pedicure because I was heading home anyways and my experience before was good regarding my pedi. Odry was my pedicurist again today and she did a good job again today, \n\nHowever regarding the spa pedicure incident and feeling as if my patronage is not appreciated I will not be returning.\n\nThere are one too many nail salons in sj to put up with sub par service and basically staff trying to fly you out the door when you want a longer or upgraded service.",

After reading some reviews, I was convinced to go with the Lemon Basil Mojito..pitcher. At $34 - you get a large pitcher of this cocktail. \nWe started off with the bacon-wrapped bleu cheese stuffed dates as I have an addiction to a version of these that I make with manchego and prosciutto - my version blows these away....way away. Mojo must deep fry their version as the crispiness of the bacon really turned me off. We also got the edamame curried hummus with some lavash crackers. This was simple but tasted really nice - lacked enough crackers to finish off the hummus. \nWe got a flatbread pizza and a trio of sliders (Korean BBQ, lamb, black bean) for our next course. The flatbread pizza was forgettable and the best slider was the black bean for sure. The Korean BBQ had a really strange tasting slaw that needed some spice and salt. The bread pudding for dessert was the all-star of the meal and almost got Mojo four stars. Mojo offered good tasting food and solid drink, but doesn't warrant the price.",

I make it a point to patronize local businesses and we chose Coach's. That was apparently our first mistake and it only got worse. We came in the side door to see a busy bar area; the bartender looked at us, said nothing and went back to her bar customers. Apparently, a server had to be called in, but after 15 minutes of being totally ignored, we were getting ready to walk out. When the new server finally made her way over to us, she was friendly but didn't apologize for the lousy service. She took our drink orders before dashing away again, and came back with them 10 minutes later. At that time, we ordered. I got wings and my husband a patty melt or something along those lines. During the 45 minutes, yes 45, we waited for our food, my husbands beer had been gone to 25 with no offer of refill. When the food arrived, it wasn't worth bothering with. Sloppily thrown together and not at all hot. The wings I got were of very poor quality. Many broken bones, and had an old taste to them. Sauce was flavorless. The blue cheese dressing was good tho. After we had been served, a couple of nice looking guys came in and sat next to us. The bartender (female) who had completely ignored us made a beeline for them. Was so friendly and chatty with them, but never once looked our way. I guess we aren't the \"right\" clientele. I guess Coach's 2 has enough business that they don't need ours, because we won't be back.",

When they did answer the phone they never said hello but laid the phone down and I could hear all going on in the store including the man stating he called but no one answered and then placed his order. I received my order at 7:20pm. The delivery guy didn't thank me, give a reason why it took so long or give me a copy of my receipt. Both pizzas were barely warm and the wings were cold and I had to warm them. I truly do not recommend this location.

Usually the Crispy Chicken sandwich is a perfectly sized chicken breast although lately I've been receiving a pounded out thin chicken patty instead.  Either the crispy chicken sandwich is getting smaller or there's more of an inconsistency with it.  Wish I would've taken a pic of the 1/8\" pounded out patty with 1/4\" of breading.

  "text": "Was recommended this place by a hotel employee while visiting Philly on my last day of the trip.  First thing I noticed was how quiet it was.  There were a few others dining there but the music was very low, which kind of made the vibe uncomfortable.  Our waiter (I think his name was David) hovered way too much for my liking as if we were a nuisance.  I ordered the lamb sliders and mac and cheese.  They were both delicious and cooked to perfection.  Once the bill arrived it was combined for me friend and I.  (why do restaurants assume to female friends who are dining wouldnt be paying separately?)  Anywho, I asked, can you separate the bills.  To which David replied I can do it myself and itemize the bill and list which card was paying for which, this REALLY ticked me off.  So as I sat there trying to separate each of our orders, drinks and taxes he literally stood over my should, not to offer any assistance but to rush me.  We felt like we were intruding just by dining there.  Plus side, is there were great picture ops on the deck.IF I return when visiting Philly again, I'd definitely ask for a different waiter.",

  "text": "What initially was a pleasant experience turned out to be a horrible revealing of a scam!\n\nI am moving out with my girlfriend and this was our first mattress buying experience. We were a little nervous and didn't know what to expect. \n\nOur sales associate was named Joe.\n\nHe was helpful in letting us try different beds and we found one that was \"On sale\". It was a Simmons Recharge mattress. Sensing how green we were, Joe talked us up and threw in a \"free\" basic bed frame and charged an additional $50 for a mattress protector. Not knowing what to expect, we thought we were getting a good deal. BOY WE WERE WRONG!\n\nThe Product:\nThe full sized mattress \"On Sale\" was $950.00 but only worth about $500 online.\nThe mattress protector was $50 but only worth about $20 online.\nThe box spring was given \"free\" but is of poor quality. The center leg is loose and the frame is not sturdy. The weak frame makes noise with the slightest movement on the bed.\nBasic box frame.\nThe delivery charge was $99.00 and was a whole other story in itself.\n\nDelivery:\nThe delivery guys came at the end of a 4 hour window. If we would have known this, we wouldn't have to wait around for half a day wasting our time. \nOnce they came, they didn't show any form of identification. The only reason we assumed they worked for Sleepy's was becuase of the Sleepy's truck. We were reluctant to let them enter our home, however what choice do we have while waiting for our $1,000 bed?!\nWithout saying much, the delivery men promptly setup the mattress, box frame, and bed frame.\nWe asked if we could thoroughly inspect everything before they left. This is an IMPORANT step becuase any little tear or stain will VOID the proclaimed \"worry free warranty\". The delivery men were confused and didn't understand our request. They eventually said \"okay\" but made us feel like we were wasting their time.\n\nThe delivery men also gave us the cheap mattress liner Joe up sold us on. As they delivery men were leaving, my girlfriend promptly puts the liner in the washing machine thinking we were done with the ordeal. 10 minutes later, we get a phone call from the delivery men. They told us they gave us the WRONG mattress liner! We told them we already opened and put it into the washing machine. Their response was \"Why didn't you check before opening it? Can you quickly put it in the dryer? We will be back\". Dumbfounded and insulted by their response, we angrily put it in the dryer. The men came back in 20 minutes but the mattress cover was not yet dry. The delivery men gave us an attitude as if this was OUR fault. We told them to come back in 30 minutes. They had no choice and said \"okay\". We called them in 30 minutes and they told US TO WAIT FOR THEM! We already waited all day for the mattress! What the Hell were these guys thinking?! They insisted they were on the way back however, they didn't arrive for another HOUR! Once they arrived they gave us the mattress liner and put the other one back in the BAG! No apology and no compensation was given for our wasted time. I feel sorry for the next customer who they delivered that too, as the product is no longer NEW. The delivery was a nightmare and THEY COMPLETELY wasted our time.\n\nDisgusted with the experience so far, We went to a local sleepy's were we returned the mattress liner and got our $50.00 back, or so we thought.\n\nJoe gave us a follow up call later that evening. We explained our experience and he stated that he would issue a refund for the delivery. We also told him we returned the mattress liner. As a promise of good faith, Joe said he would send us one for free because he \"wanted us to have one\".\n\nFast forward 1 week, and have have no refund and no mattress liner. We called Joe back and he said the refund was NEVER Processed. We were FURIOUS! We could not understand why it was not immediately refunded when we returned the merchandise at the sleepy's store! Joe had a heated argument with my girlfriend and said \"You are getting upset over $50.00\". We have every right to be upset even if it was over 1 cent! 2 days later, the refunds were processed however, no mattress liner was ever sent. We don't expect Joe to ever send one now.\n\nSleepy's is a rip off company with scam sales associates that treat you like they are selling used cars. The delivery service is completely unprofessional. They DO NOT process returns in a timely manner even when you give them their merchandise back. God forbid we ever have to call them again for warranty concerns or other issues. We will NEVER DO business with them again, and I will make sure everyone and the internet knows not to as well.",

Had a valve gasket replaced and a simple diagnostic check (engine light came on) for a whopping $275. Most of that which was cost in labor.  Went home kicking myself knowing I could have done the work at home for a hell of a lot cheaper.  Of course after watching a few YouTube videos for difficulty level. They also recommended a Tune-up for a cost of $363.90.  Ugh no thank you.  Found all my part on Rockauto for $54.00.  Doing this one myself. Oh well, you live and you learn I guess.",

I was excited but skeptical at the idea of sushi in Idaho so I told her I'd give it a try the next time I am in town.  \n\nI went in today for lunch.  We were the only ones there at first and then the stampede showed up!  The one waitress working had to juggle ten tables by the time we were finished with our meal.\n\nWe had edamame for a starter.  It was very good but had a lot of salt on it.  Not a good choice for those watching their salt intake.  I ordered a California roll fried and my co-diner had a Winding Creek Roll.  I was a little bummed that mine didn't have any sauce on it and I kept using the sauce off the Winding Creek roll.  The food was alright overall, but not the best I've had.\n\nThe reason I'm giving this such a low rating is because I got food poisoning.  About 20 minutes after eating there, I started getting symptoms of food poisoning.  Fortunately the illness only lasted about 5 hours, but let me just say that the Cali roll didn't taste that great the second time around.  I didn't even have sashimi, so I'm not sure what caused this.",

The service alone is worth five stars and I will tell you why. We encountered a rude bartender who was openly upset, declaring he was aggravated that they were so busy.  He was rude to my sister in law who's birthday we were celebrating.  A problem seems to bring the best out of these people, the manager and the owner were the most engaged and professional we have ever seen. My brother is a chef at a resort (we will not name here) and he was the most impressed in our party.  But on par with the incredible service was the food. Everything our table received was exceptional. The omelettes are perfect. We had one of each between us. The savory breakfast bowl was very impressive, a great combination of ingredients and well executed. We will be back. And we will be sending a lot of people in the meantime, you can count on both.",

  "text": "Warning, I am all over the place with my review of Pub and Kitchen. I have to say we had wonderful service but it was an extremely loud restaurant and at times impossible to communicate with her.  We made a mistake by bringing my mother who is in her mid 70's for dinner.  What was I thinking?! In my defense, the last time I had been to P&K was over an early weekend lunch and it was really quiet. If there is a next time I'll sit in the back room and perhaps leave her at home.  \n     As far as the food my review is mixed. The menu didn't seem to offer enough standard pub fare or traditional dinner plates. Our server was friendly and upbeat and pretty darn quick considering that the restaurant was jam packed this early Saturday evening. Our table shared very creamy yummy deviled eggs. The eggs were fairly standard but didn't last long to really mull over their merits.  I had AMISH CHICKEN with a savoy cabbage roll and butternut squash.  I was really looking forward to it because it was highly recommended on other reviews. Unfortunately this was not a wow dish for me. Our server said that it was a half of a chicken but it just didn't seem to pan out The piece of chicken was underwhelming what. The stuffed cabbage was odd and all in all the plate was one dimensional. The menu for dinner was fairly limited and I wish they had a few more items to choose from Igather that The kitchen must be small. I will say, one of my dinner partners had the cheese and charcuterie platter. That looked  delicious. The onion dip by standard, the waffle chips were addictive! \nSo in conclusion if you're bringing granny out perhaps choose a different spot for dinner.  I personally would recommend sticking to the pub like food... snacks, chicken wings, dips and for sure the  waffle chips! If you are adverse to loud restaurant dinners just go for drinks.",

Well, when most of the items are great price and cheaper than any other place, some are more expensive than Meijer or Walmart. So you do your homework before shopping at COSTCO, but overall 5 star for this COSTCO!",

  "text": "If you like having to argue for some basic amenities at a restaurant, in this case food, then this place is for you. If like the rest of us, you enjoy timely, courteous, judgement free service, take your business elsewhere. \n\n1. We ordered four orders of the feta dip (which to their credit was actually divine) for a group of 14 and were given a total of FIVE tiny pita pockets. When we asked our waitress for more pita, we were told to peel  the pita in half for more. Lady, we know what a godamn pita pocket is. We aren't rationing for a flood or in prison. Bring us more pita. After initial reluctance, the wait staff brought us only TWO more pieces of pita for a table of FOURTEEN. We again requested more so there could be enough for everyone at the table but we were asked why we needed more since we were still ordering entrees. Is there a pita shortage in Nashville that I wasn't aware of? Is there a reason why a \"Yes we can bring you enough but it might charge extra?\" was so hard to do? AND THEN, at the end of our meal when we declined dessert, the waitress responded with \"I figured you were full from all that pita.\" Long story short, if you want to save yourself the investigation by the wait staff about why you would like enough food for everyone, bring your own pita. \n\n2. Service was excruciatingly slow. If you want ketchup with your burger and fries, then too bad because you'll only get it after you've eaten all your food. You also may be asked to provide a PHD caliber defense for why you need extra ketchup. \n\n3. The waitress explained that everything on the menu was meant to be shared. We found this strange considering everything on the brunch menu was mostly sandwiches, but figured we would wait and see. When the chicken biscuit came out in a portion fit for a developing fetus, we really had to wonder if this was a restaurant or a fat camp. \n\n4. We had to put down a deposit of $10 per person for the reservation. The restaurant charged us anyway even though we all arrived on time and when asked to apply this charged portion to the final bill, it took two conversations with the inapprpriate, winking manager to settle the dispute. \n\nBottom line, don't bother coming here unless you want to be volunteered as tribute into the real life hunger games.",

It was for a Chicken California with fries and a drink for $5.99. I jumped right on it.\n\nThey cook the meat right in front of you and still manage to get sandwiches out quick. My Chicken California was so good I actually made sure to eat it slowly and enjoy it. Chicken, provolone cheese, ranch, and other fixin's... I'm drooling just recalling the memory.\n\nI saved almost 70% for lunch that day (I had been on my way to another restaurant for a $15.00 entree...must've been thinking with my stomach)!",

  "text": "Let me preface this review by saying The Grill has always been one of my favorite Reno restaurants. Good food, nice atmosphere, and( usually) friendly, helpful service. Scott, the bartender that served us on Aug 4th has changed  the latter part of that statement. Never, ever have I experienced such rude, almost threatening behavior from any server, anywhere. He was obnoxious the minute we sat down, made rude remarks under his breath and generally treated us as if we were a HUGE inconvience just by being there.He actually became very aggressive when I had the audacity to ask for the bill. Sam Frankovich needs to remove this guy promptly before he has a lawsuit on his hands. So no matter how good the food is, if I ever see this guy behind the bar (or anywhere else) I will leave.",

My husband I am we're close to them so we decided to have a quick breakfast. \n\nThe Place:\nThey are located in front of David's Bridal, in a cute little building. It looks really traditional and old school. Yet really adorable and you had the feeling of comfort food. \n\nThe Food:\nFood was traditional breakfast and lunches, with great selection of Mimosas, unfortunately it was a week day so no fun Brunch, just breakfast :(\nI got some coffee and water while looking at the menu. \nI ordered some \"Traditional pancakes\" and a side of scramble eggs- they were really yummy and fluffy. The eggs were amazing! They had a great taste, like if they just pick them up from the farm earlier in the morning (seriously!)\nMy husband got the \"Eggs Benedicts\" with hash browns- i stole half of his hash browns and they were so yummy! \n\nThe Service:\nThe service was great, the food came out fast and we had breakfast in like 30 minutes which was what we were looking for. \n\nOverall: 4 Stars (Salmita's Scale) I still want to come back and eat with more time, try more meals and their mimosas of course! ;-)",

I was a walk in and they were able to accommodate me as Fonda has hired a couple of technicians she is training. (I would probably call next time to make sure they can take me) Alex, the nail artist who started my Premier Pedicure, first offered me something to drink and then started my pedicure. He was very thorough with getting my toes cleaned up, scrubbing and massaging. Fonda took over and put on the color and cleaned up a little more. I appreciate that it is her name above the door and she wants to make sure everything is done to her specifications. I LOVE the outcome and the color (Terra Cotta and I think number 425)\nThis salon is extremely clean and has a huge assortment of colors to choose from. I feel they are fairly priced and there is still free parking on that part of Central Ave so that's always a good thing. \nI also enjoyed talking to Danny who was there lending support and customer interaction. :) \nA very enjoyable experience and I will definitely be a repeat customer!",

It was a late lunchtime on a weekday so it was empty but that fared well for us because service was a-one.\n\nMany interesting items on the menu you don't normally see.  Surprisingly, there were a house special wings that I have never heard of.  Mambo wings.  Had to have them.  Not glad I did.  I liken them to crack or heroin.  If you never try it, you won't ever crave it.  I am a pushover for wing recipes I haven't had and I never heard of Mambo wings so I had to get them.  Now, I crave them daily.  \n\nWaiter said they got the recipe from D.C.  Now I research them and they have been around a long time there although more often called Mumbo wings.  Mumbo sauce is apparently common in chinese take out joints in D.C. but has a large wing following.  Enough that there are Mumbo wing restaurants.  I have been a wing-head ever since they first came to this area with Hooters, Melons, Mugs N' Jugs and mostly because I lived across the street from Knockers (where the original Winghouse is now).  That was around 1989.  27 years of wings and I have not heard of Mumbo wings.  Damn you to hell 1933 Pub & Grill.\n\nNot sold in Walmart.  Not in Publix.  Not in Winn-Dixie.  I must make the trek to 1933 or suffer the consequences of $15 per bottle on Amazon or Walmart.com.  This may be my last review as I may be broke soon due to the scarcity of Mumbo sauce in this area.",

During my first visit I bellied up to the world-famous Sandwich Cubano (roasted pork, ham, pickles, Swiss cheese and mustard on a Cuban style bread). Man, I tell you, it was SPOT ON. Reminded me of my trip years ago when I had my first one. The meat was roasted to perfection, delivered a dynamite of flavor and was too damn good to stop eating! If you try one thing here, this is it!\n\nOn another occasion I was served the Ropa Vieja (shredded beef in Cuban Creole sauce with onions and peppers. Served with white rice, black beans and sweet ripe plantains (maduros)). This also happens to be Cuba's national dish! Again, each bite took me back to Havana. Sweet, delicate and tender beef paired with fresh cooked rice and beans. The taste was outstanding. Boise lacks so many authentic cuisine but Casablanca reminds me that true food is there if you seek it. \n\nOn another note, I absolutely loved our waiter both times. He was very kindhearted and humorous, took time to inform us of what each dish consisted of, which was super helpful for my very Americanized husband (nothing wrong with that - he just doesn't have the palate for authentic food like I do!). \n\nIn a heartbeat, I recommend this to anyone who is tired of over-sweetened, sodium packed eateries that boast but fail to deliver genuine cuisine. Also, if you've never had Cuban food you are missing out on so much!!! And it's here, in little Boise so HEAD OVER AND SUPPORT THIS LOCAL BUSINESS that I love so dearly!",

  "text": "Honestly I would give them zero stars if I could. I reached out to them shortly after finding out I was moving to Nashville and immediately got a phone call from Ben. Initially it seemed very promising and like a great way to go about finding an apartment but it went downhill REALLY fast. He advised that because of the number of people moving to Nashville on a daily basis it would be hard for him to help me at that time since I did not want to go sight unseen and because I wouldn't be down for 2 weeks. He told me when i knew what day I would be in Nashville to email him to set up an appointment. I emailed him 3 days later to set up an appointment and heard nothing. I followed up a couple days after that and nothing. I then attempted to start over from the beginning with a new request on this website and heard nothing. I submitted another request on the website just before I left New Jersey and heard nothing. Luckily I ended up finding a place on my own quickly but I was extremely disappointed in the lack of response from an otherwise promising company. I don't know if it was just straight up unprofessionalism or if it was because I didn't have the budget to rent in a fancy luxury apartment where they probably would have made more money. Suggestion to the company if you want to stay in the good graces of potential clients, respond to them even if it's just to say you can't help them. Ignoring messages is a great way to lose a potential future customer and I promise I would never in a million years recommend this company to anyone.",

Okay, granted it was 3p.\n\nSo we drove over to Donut House which I haven't been to since like Nerinx days. Ken and I were ecstatic over the selection and the cashier asked us if we had been there before and if we lived nearby. I told her she could tell her customers we drove all the way from Kansas for these donuts. The next thing you know I'm chatting up the old folks about  scrubby dutch, Thomas coffee, the old Goodwill--good South City fodder. I left wishing I had a donut shop like that down the street.

Dumplings are only sold in groups of 5 unless you head over on Wednesday when they have $1 dumplings. Typically you can not mix Sweet and savory but the counter guy was feeling friendly and allowed me to do so. My friend and I ordered a cheesesteak noodles and a 5 pack of dumplings. Taco, buffalo chicken, cheesesteak, apple pie and cheesecake. There are sauces on the table are great for dipping. As a condiment lover, enjoyed them greatly! The dumplings were packed with flavor. The cheesesteak was my favorite savory And the cheesecake my favorite sweet. Apparently cheese is the key to my happiness! I might have ordered another if they available individually.\n\nThe noodles were fresh. Ramen style but fancier. They were tossed in a white super gooey delicious cheese sauce with large pieces of cheesesteak and perfectly cut scallions. \n\nLooking forward to hearing back to try some more. Hopefully my next trip will be on a Wednesday where you can buy as many or as few as you would like!",

I called for a Milky Way and forgot to request it cold. Nonetheless, it was DELICIOUS and beautiful to boot. \n\nThough there are no couches for that homey sort of feel, I love all the tables because 1. They're big enough for all my shenanigans I bring to the coffee shop. \n2. There is no lack of plugs. \n3. They're spread out enough that everyone's biz is their own.\n4. This is a weird one. I love seeing people I know, but sometimes it can be distracting when trying to knock something out. There are enough tables that you don't have to be by the front door where you'd constantly be looking up when someone comes in and possibly seeing someone you know with the obligation to chat. And there is a back door that you can escape out of. \n\nMy only problem is the chairs are a little tough on my boney butt, but I think that's a personal problem. Next time I'll just bring one of those blow up cushions, and be the cool kid. Will definitely be returning!!!",

Now you could do the fancy brunch buffets, or pick the perfect patio to while away the day, or you could get right down to business and cure what ails ya with some serious food, like the brunch slice at Noble Pie! \n\nThis piece of pizza is nothing to muck with! They top a large slice with their creamy and garlicky bianco Base, a light layer of mozz, prosciutto, sun-dried tomato, asparagus, and red onion, and then top it with spicy hollandaise and... wait for it... a FARM FRESH EGG! As soon as it arrives you've gotta slather that ooey gooey egg yolk all over the slice and enjoy. The flavor combo is dy-no-mite and it's the perfect piece to put that hangover out to pasture! \n\nOn top of that beauty, Noble also rocks a full brunch menu with calzomelettes, sourdough toasts with eggs, cheese, and fresh veggies, a BYO Blood Mary and Bottomless Mimosas, and a full cocktail menu, all served up in a chillaxed atmosphere! Oh yeah, they also have gluten free crust and are happy to accommodate any special requests you might have.\n\nNoble is an awesome addition to downtown Reno and a stop worth making for brunch, lunch or dinner.

I don't NEED a damn car to buy groceries or things for the house..that's what SHIPPING is for..I just use the cars to leave the city every once in the while.. is that soo bad??\n\nI am now a proud ZipCar member and happy that I made the shift!  :)\n\n#",

You order and pay as you walk in, then get your drinks and seat yourself. Your food is then served to you. We weren't halfway through our appetizers of lettuce wraps and two crab wontons when our food was served. We had the Honey Crispy Chicken with white rice and the Pei Wei Spicy Chicken. We loved the lettuce wraps. The rest was good but nothing special.\n\nDon't let the word \"diner\" fool you. Good food but pricey. For $32 we could have gotten more bang for our buck at our local chinese restaurant.",

It smelled a little off, especially in the back.  I got the curry chicken and the wife got Fried wonton & seafood soup.\n\nThe curry chicken was totally bland and also basically lacking one thing, chicken.  I was really let down by it overall.  The soup, which I did try, was okay but still not as good as our usual place, PHO 21.  We also got pork egg rolls for an appetizer which again, were okay but nothing great.\n\nIt was also about $6 bucks more for the same amount of food as compared to our usual spot as well.  They did have a wide variety of things to choose from on the menu but with what we had tonight being so poor I doubt we will be back to try much else.  The other thing I didn't really care for was our waitress.  She left me feeling like we were a nuisance to her overall because we had the audacity to come into the establishment and order food.\n\nWith so many Vietnamese places in Reno you can surely find one better than this place.  I highly recommend PHO 21 just off McCarran next to the Flowing Tide Pub, much better.",

Rich French cuisine that will make you happy you skipped lunch to enjoy each morsel to the fullest.\n\nParking is plentiful around the design center and once you arrive at the Bistro, you could be overlooking the Seine and not the Schuykill.\n\nService was friendly, present, timely, and on point in every way.  Drinks were strong, food was decadent with a great variety.  Everything is made fresh so almost any dietary restriction can be honored (as I overheard a waiter say).\n\nThe small bread balls were hot and fresh, through the escargot with cream and mushrooms and the fresh salad with beet and pickle chunks next to a sublime pork belly as an appetizer.  Everything on each plate was cooked to perfection in texture and flavor.\n\nIt will definitely be a special place to go versus a regular hangout.

I had the pork sandwich on texas toast, for 9 bucks I think, and it was very tasty, and the fries were really good as well.  Do beware of the BBQ sauce, they only had a choice of sweet or spicy, and choosing spicy was a mistake.  It literally burnt my mouth off, the hottest thing I have ever eaten.  I suggest to the chefs to offer more BBQ sauce selections.  Other than that it was a cute restaurant, with a fun atmosphere.",

I settled in at a nice table by the window and he ordered for the both of us.You order and pay at the counter, which is cool. He knows what I like for breakfast and that makes me happy. I got the egg breakfast with bacon and perfect over easy eggs. No toast but the best homemade biscuit ever.   Hubby is not a big fan of biscuits but kept sneaking bites of mine and said it was the best he ever tasted(bold statement). He ordered the Envie which is eggs,brie and ham on a fresh croissant. I'm telling you, we were both so happy after eating, it was sinful. The cook  (Steven I think), delivers your food  which is a great touch. Hubbys'  food was delicious and mine was very tasty. We both had the cafe au lait , which was nice and hot and creamy, I added cinnamon to mine. I love this place and will be back every time we come to this fine city. If you're tired of the touristy breakfast places in the Quarter, try this hidden gem just off Bourbon Street, by the river, in one of the oldest areas of the city. If you don't like cool, funky coffee shops with awesome open air seating, great food, and quirky but very cool staff, then I would suggest hitting a Starbucks for a $4 latte and a stale muffin, don't worry we won't miss you.",

Given a poor performance at R'evolution the night before, and this was only lunch I was not expecting much. Thankfully, Emeril's surpassed my expectations and merits a repeat visit on future visits to NO. We were a party of 11 celebrating my niece's college graduation and we were given a private room. \nA three member staff were very attentive to our every need. Water, iced tea and soda glasses were constantly replenished. Any shared dishes were split by the kitchen staff and given equal attention to presentation. Seemed like the entire wait staff organized to bring in the entrees to the table at the same time. Nice touch.\nThe food was delicious. Crispy calamari and barbecued shrimp were delicious. Chicken and sausage gumbo had great flavor and the spice level was just right. I wasn't very adventurous with my double creole burger and fries, but it came out cooked to order and was a delicious burger. Everyone else was equally pleased with their entrees. The group compares all banana cream pie to the matriarch's version and they devoured the Emeril's version. And the peanut butter pie was just as good.\nWe had a great meal for a fair price. The city has a ton of great dining and Emeril's earned itself a stay at the top.",

To start with, the chipotle, almond guacamole is hands down the best guacamole I have ever tasted (sorry, mom). It was perfect size and perfect taste. I tried looking for it on the menu but I didn't see it so I hope they didn't do away with it - if you are there ask about it! You won't regret it. \n\nFor the main course, I had the molcajete de carne which was delicious and a BIG portion. I didnt share it but it might be good to share. If you plan on having your traditional mexican beers at this place forget it. They don't sell XX or any other mexican beers that you have tried in the past. They sell what they call \"an authentic\" mexican beer which is good. My date had a margarita that she thought was good. \n\nThe restaurant has a pretty good feel to it - dim with traditional mexican decorations. I didn't really like our table as we were off to the side and it was kind of small. We were in the walkway so it was a bit uncomfortable. \n\nThe waiter was knowledgeable, funny and attentive. He even taught my date a few spanish phrases which was cool. \n\nOverall great experience at tequila's a def must go if you are looking for mexican food in Philly.",

Despite how busy it was, we still got in and out within an hour and our waiter was great. Would definitely recommend this place for anyone. Really great atmosphere.",

It seems like most of Chestnut Hill has stopped in to take a look and of course do some food shopping....especially after the blizzard on the weekend.  Like the other Fresh Markets I have been in, this is an extremely attractive store. The food exhibits are very well done....everything looks so fresh and new.  The store is on the smallish side for a supermarket these days but it is of course much larger than a specialty food shop.  Right now there are a lot of tasting stations throughout the store.  I don't think most of these will continue after the grand opening weeks ... but they do add a friendly touch.  There is one big drawback here and that is the prices.  They are def very high.  Maybe these prices will fit in perfectly with many shoppers from well-heeled Chestnut Hill ... but I can't see a lot of other people using this market for more than the occasional specialty item and continuing to do their regular grocery shopping elsewhere.",

They take a slice of that and toss it into the nice oven and get it out to you ASAP. \nThe seating is First Come First Serve. Great place to go to watch the game with friends and have a pizza and beer.  You can definitly hawk/vulture tables till it becomes empty. Great college place to be at.

The drinks I've had thus far--a Chemex with South American beans (Mexico, I think) and an Americano--were perfectly delicious. The staff are much more helpful than most baristas I've run into, particularly in the context of local, artisan type shops. \n\nIf you're downtown and want some brew, don't miss the chance to get the best of the best here at Kaffeine.",

The breweries we visited were Books & Brews, Bier, Triton, and Redemption. Each brewery knew we were coming and had samples set up for us. They also took time to tell us about the beer. The Brewsline is more than transportation between the breweries, they make sure that you have a good time and that you learn about the beers and breweries that you're experiencing. Our driver also told us which places served food and if it would take a long time for the food to come (we were on a schedule).\n\nThis was a great experience and I would certainly go again.",

My waxer made me feel very comfortable. The whole process took about 20 minutes or so. I originally purchased the sugar wax on Groupon but was told that wasn't recommended for someone who has never been waxed before so I stuck with the regular wax.

They no longer carry everything to make Sherly temples my favorite drink of all time which is quite upsetting. But overall I love the staff and the food.

We took a quick look at the menu and decided to give it a try.\n\nThe server was friendly although extremely slow! I ordered the beer sampler which gave a taste of their 6 different beers while my boyfriend ordered a mojito. The mojito was horrible and tasted like pure soda water. We were able to switch it out for a sangria which was pretty bad but we didn't want to complain again. For dinner, my boyfriend ordered the smoked half chicken which came out extremely dry and flavorless. I ordered the margherita pizza which was the worst thing I ever ate! It was pure garlic throughout the entire pizza. I even got sick within 10 minutes of leaving because of how much garlic the chef put into it. \n\nThankfully, the server was friendly and took the pizza off the bill even though we never even interacted with a manager. The ONLY reason I am giving this place 2 stars is because of how nice the server was. This place definitely looked promising from the outside but was a complete waste of time.

Hint: stay downstairs in the old carriage house if you want to relive that college experience of when the upstairs booze hounds return to traipse around every square foot of their spacious, thin-floored apartment at 3 a.m. Then again this is NOLA. Sleep is a commodity. You get what you invest in. Weekdays, a downstairs room is okay. Weekends, be upstairs only, and try to be considerate of others. If this hotel could control it's guests, I suppose it'd receive a better review. But since it can't control others' behavior, more of a buffer (insulation) between floors during their remodel would have been nice. This is more an indictment against the 20-something generation, I suppose. But Lamothe House is in the guest services business. Perhaps some signs in the rooms to control unruly guests? Right. 3-1/2 stars, on the positive side. \n\n* modern room and decor, very nice...over an old, charming skeleton...leaves one wanting, sometimes.",

I didn't realize what het was doing until it was too late. \nThey were all very nice there and I feel bad saying anything. But now I have to wait a month or two for my hair to grow back on the side.

When we asked, we kept getting a rundown of what they had rather than explaining how the pricing/ordering worked. We hardly saw our server. I still wanted to give it another shot since I enjoyed the food.\n\nSecond experience was way better! Food was just as good, if not, better. We had a fantastic waitress, Shelly. She was incredibly attentive and provided excellent service. We will absolutely be back! \n\nBlack pepper beef is my favorite so far especially in the udon noodle dish. I also tried orange chicken, which was pretty good. My husband ordered the kung pao chicken, which he claimed wasn't spicy enough. It was perfectly spicy in my opinion. To each his own.\n\nDim sum is the best I've had in Tampa. Honey BBQ pork buns are pretty tasty. My favorite off the carts is the egg tart. If you see the special egg tart with cream - it's so worth the extra $1! So tasty!",

I gave them the dates that I would be parking and I asked them if I needed a reservation. The employee told me numerous times that reservations are not necessary because they do not anticipate on being full. I then called them the night before my trip to ensure that everything was OK, and they informed me that it was.\n\nWe arrived to the parking lot on the day of our travel, and were told that we can't park there because we need a reservation!! I tried explaining that I called twice and was told reservations are not necessary. The attendant told me there was nothing he could do!\n\nThis kind of stress is exactly what I was trying to avoid on a day that there was a scheduled flight leaving. This place took absolutely no responsibility and did not even acknowledge that it could've been possible that they made a mistake! They were trying to blame me! They left us high and dry with no place to park. These people absolutely cannot be counted on.\n\nAs soon as I started asking for a supervisor, I kept getting wishy-washy answers like oh they're not here today, oh I don't know when they will be back. Sounds like someone was trying to avoid getting in trouble!",

We had to order everything at the bar while we were there, but that didn't really bother me. The truffled mac and cheese is AMAZING. Poutine is tasty, as are the chorizo and manchego fries. The cucumber salad is, oddly enough, kind of spicy, but very yummy. For dessert, I had the flourless chocolate cake, which comes with a blackberry-ginger sauce.\n\nOverall, I'm a fan.

I called ahead to find out their hours and was told \"8-6 Monday through Friday\". I arrived at 8:15 and although the closed sign was up, all the lights were on  and there were two people inside laughing and drinking coffee. The only sign referencing their hours says \"24 hour service\". This is a lie. I waved at one to let him know I was there and he looked right at me then kept talking to his buddy. I then knocked and without moving a muscle the guy yells from across the room \"8:30!!\" and goes back to chating with his friend. It was about 26 degrees outside where I was left to stand for 15 minutes while these two jokers got to catch up on office gossip. When they did finally let me in they were immediately confrontational. Long story short, I left and will never ever darken their doorstep again. \n\nThere are so many quality professional locksmiths in the Treasure Valley, do not give your money to these losers. I went to A-1 Lock and Safe and was treated very well and paid WAAAAY less than the original price quoted to me by Baldwin. Save yourself the headache and go somewhere else.",

Instead said they'd call when it came in. They never called once, instead I had to call monthly just to be told it still wasn't in. They continued to say they'd call with updates, never did. Called them yesterday to find out the windshield came in a month earlier. Never apologized for not calling. Then said the price they quoted several months earlier has changed and was now over $100 more , couldn't give good explanation why.  The girl answering the phone could not have been ruder or less apologetic.  Needless to say found another local place (clear vision glass) that was cheaper and came to my house that day and did a great job. Wish I discovered them 6 months earlier.",

My brother and I always talk about this special memory with my father and how good the food was. The other memory I have with this place is when me and my fiancé first started dating we took a trip to Tucson to do some hiking and sightseeing and had a great time and enjoyed everything Tucson had to offer especially this place. We love the lights in the gardens and the food was great. I would never called this place the best Italian food I've ever had but it was excellent because the food was savory and the ambience is relaxing and the customer service was superb. My fiancé left her purse there after hours and they were kind enough to open up well over two hours after we left the restaurant just so she can get her purse and everything was perfect. I would highly recommend this place plus it's close to college so the area is pretty cool. Don't expect to have the greatest Italian food ever but expect a great experience with some savory food items.",

  "text": "When you walk in to Toucan Charlie's buffet you are immediately surrounded by what looks like a tropical garden. Then the aroma of the food will begin to start your mouth salivating to say the least. The options available to you on any given day are amazing. I opted for the salad bar first, which I must say is impressive. The average salad to the most delectable of fruit and vegetable pre-made salads are wonderful. The choices are endless. The soups remind me of something your grandmother would have made when you were visiting, fabulous. On to the entrees, where you can have your fill of many different cultures. There are American, Mexican, Chinese, Mongolian etc... Seafood options are endless as well. Shrimp, Crab, Oysters, Fish (baked and/or fried) Prime rib that will send you on your merry way to heaven. It is tender and flavorful. On to the dessert: Cookies, cakes, ice cream, pie, cookie bars, donuts etc... I have to say my favorites are all of it. However they do have this coconut raspberry cookie bar that I have to have everytime I visit. Oh and the chocolate layer cake, blueberry pie. So I guess I really love dessert or they are just amazing at what they do. Needless to say, it is all fabulous, and I can't wait for my next adventure into food there.",

  "text": "My wife and I had seen some negative reviews for this place on Yelp, but we believe in forming our own opinions so we gave it a try.  We found nothing wrong here.  The food was good and reasonably priced.  The service was friendly, courteous, and delivered our order in a reasonable amount of time.  Our server explained that the previous reviews came right after they opened and they now have an all new staff.  We enjoyed our meal here and will definitely return.  We had pizza and Parmesan garlic bread this time.  Next time we'll try the calzones and mac 'n' cheese.  The only downside to this place is that the marinara dip is served cold and the drinks are served in cans (even for dine-in).  They would change this if they could, but their franchise overlords will not permit it.  This did not detract significantly from our experience.",

I will definitely keep this on my list of favs.  The menu was extensive but not complicated - and had lots of my favorites at very reasonable prices.\n\nI ordered the fresh spring rolls and some curry chicken, no rice. The spring rolls were super fresh and delicious, and they didn't skimp on the pork and other goodies inside. The curry chicken was awesome - and the portions were large.\n\nThe service was super fast, and several times we were asked how our meal was and how we were doing. Very unusual for a \"fast food\" type place. They were efficient, polite, and interested in what we had to say!\n\nAll in all, very impressed.

  "text": "Eddie is exactly the type of guy I imagine my great-great-grandfather would have enlisted for help after his stopwatch died. He reads as very trusting and family oriented, and a true Tucson native.\n\nExactly the type of person who consistently earns my business.\n\nI had never heard about his establishment before stopping in. I found that he had a listing on Yelp... but he didn't have any reviews or photos or tips. Steep risk, I thought, but there was absolutely no way I was going to set foot in a mall or visit a big-name jeweler. \n\nI'm glad I took the chance.\n\nEddie has a very small, nondescript and antique-y type of shop. He offers watch and jewelry repair, and works with gold, silver, etc. He also does custom work. He will also resize rings and remount. Inspection and cleaning services are free here.\n\nI am not certain how long he has been at this particular location, which is at the very back of what looks like apartments converted into small businesses. Protip: Do not park in that tiny lot off of Broadway Boulevard. Go to the back and you will find ample parking. \n\n\nApparently, Eddie has been in the business for more than three decades. He was born and raised here, and also trained in his craft in Tucson by his father! Pretty cool. And there were a couple of things in there that I imagined hadn't been touched or moved since they had been placed.\n\nI arrived with my Citizen watch, one that I've had for 10 years. This watch is very dear and quite special to me. Of all of my possessions, it is among my most protected, actually because it was such a special gift.\n\nI had to leave it with Eddie because it has a highly specialized battery, which he had to track down. Turns out he ended up having it shipped directly from Japan. He and I had never met, and I didn't want to leave the watch. \n\nBut I could tell from his eyes and energy that I could trust him. It was automatic. I rarely feel this way about a person on a first meeting, so I left the watch behind.\n\nThe watch was ready after a week. Took a bit longer than expected, but Eddie was very communicative, sending me text messages along the way to let me know about the progress. I appreciated that. He even buttered me up a couple of days before I picked up the watch, telling me that it was ready and \"beautiful.\"\n\nI was shocked when I saw it! It looks almost brand new! It felt like I was receiving it for the first time again. Except for a couple of deep scratches it's endured over it's decade, the watch is pristine. He also cleaned the interior and exterior and replaced the faceplate, or crystal, which gives the impression that the watch is nearly right off the factory line.\n\nIf I had a mound of broken watches and jewelry, I would take the entire lot to Eddie. \n\nHe's earned my trust.",

  "text": "I've worked maybe 2 shifts and watched a bunch of movies here while it was still the Ritz (I left way before the Landmark takeover). I love Joe and Maurice (2 workers, one is now a manager). The workers do their job and do them well. I haven't had serious issues with projection or sound (not that I can remember). The theater layout is strange and the floor in the lobby I have heard is uneven and makes you feel like you have vertigo.\n\nThe number one issue with this theater is how small the ladies room is. I haven't been into the men's room. The ladies room is really tight but I've heard rumors about expansion. I have never worked their concession but it's pretty small back there. I sucked at the cafe but as a customer, I've had no complaints. Oh, and in one of the theaters is a closet and at one point someone went in there which disturbed my movie watching experience (note: She doesn't work there anymore). This is rare that it happens, though. Also, I think the ushers do a good job of theater checks and cleaning up. Very consistent.\n\nAs for parking, go to the Olde City Garage, entrance on 2nd. Show your ticket to the person at the door or box office at the Ritz Five and they will give you a validation card. You now pay $6.50 for parking! Easy and convenient. Too bad they raised the rates, it used to be only $5 for parking.\n\nOverall, a great theater. I love the Ritz movie theaters.",

  "text": "This is a difficult place to review. On the one hand, murderously good beer: after drinking Sun King's by-no-means-un-delicious Velvet Fog (a Belgian quadrupel style) at Flatwater, I walked over to Brugge for a Tripel de Ripple nightcap. The TdR was, on this night, bready and yeasty (pear-y and apple-y) and rich and wide and deep on the palate and just plain superior to the beer I'd tasted earlier.\n\nThe experience reconfirmed my long-held opinion that Brugge Brasserie produces the finest Belgians brewed 'round these parts.\n\nOn the other hand. The food here is not quite equal to its liquid counterpart. The frites + sauces are to die for, but the sandwiches and dinner crepes are, without qualification, inferior to [less expensive{!!}] Goose the Market and Three Days in Paris, respectively. In the new order of Good Food, where \"how' counts more than \"what\", Brugge is noticeably behind. The prominently featured mussels are fairly good and unique in Indy (I think), though they too somehow seem to deliver more of a rote satiety than an exciting dose of culinary fulfillment.\n\nBasically, 5-6 star beer (I must mention that the guest tap list is limited but irreproachably inspired), 5 star fries, 2-3 star other food. It's near the ideal experience, but not quite touching.",

  "text": "I have to agree with my fellow yelpers, this is a great place for brunch. Classic diner fare with a southwest twist.  We had Jonathan's famous fiery scrambler with homemade sausage and gravy on the biscuits along the new mexican breakfast burrito.  The sausage had a good flavor but was cooked into a hockey puck, so if you get it (and I do recommend you do) maybe get it in one of their dishes instead of on the side.  The fiery scramble has great flavor and I highly recommend it.  The potatoes were deep fried which is not the way I prefer my breakfast potatoes cooked, so they were just alright.  The burrito is huge, so plan for left overs.  You can add the optional green chili on top; we didn't and regret that decision.  Will have to come back and try it again.  The place is crowded, so plan for it.  The bus outside offers a place to grab drinks while you wait, so that is a plus.  Will definitely have to give it another try.  So many good things on the menu.",

We had crab cakes, bruschetta, Mac and cheese, clams, meatballs, and one of the specials which was duck breast with duck fat shoestring fries, and chocolate decadence for dessert. The duck was amazing, perfectly cooked and the sauce that came with it was great. The only minor issue, if you could even call it that, is that the drinks were a bit slow to come out but they were packed and there is only one bartender so it makes complete sense, we just ordered our second drink before we had finished the first one and it came right when we expected. We were there probably 2 hours and didn't feel rushed at all to finish which I really appreciated. There's a lot more on the menu that I want to try so I'll for sure be back.",

We found Northeast on Yelp after getting an estimate on our brakes from a local repair shop that we thought was overly expensive.  The local shop (only 2 miles from our home) gave us an estimate of over $1300 to replace both the front and rear brake pads and rotors on our van (or $1000 for just the rear).  That shop also told us we needed new calipers and hoses.\n\nWe contacted Northeast within a few hours of getting that estimate.  Brian told us that he could do front and rear brake pads and rotors for \"less than $900\".  We took our van to Northeast the next day.  Brian called us in a timely manner and told us that we did not need new calipers and that our final bill (for front and rear brake pads and rotors) would be under $600...\n\nBrian is awesome to work with...very friendly, very knowledgeable, very experienced...\n\nWe got the work we needed done on our van for less than half what the \"other shop\" wanted to charge us!  We highly recommend Northeast Auto Service to anyone in the Indianapolis area!",

It wasn't bad but the other reviews made it sound awesome so we were disappointed more than anything else. \n\nIt's a very small place but service is spotty. Our entrees arrived about 5 minutes apart. The veggie platter was very disappointing: the falafel was dry (overcooked and burnt on one side) plus they only give you three and a tiny bit of sauce on top. The hummus was bland and the salad was nondescript (and they didn't give you the option of getting something other than the garden salad; my friend would have gladly paid extra to get the tabbouleh salad instead). \n\nI had the beef kabob platter. There was nothing very kabob-like about this as it was more of a long, thin meatloaf that, like the hummus, lacked any spice. The platter had a choice of rice OR pita. Given that the platter is served with hummus, BOTH would have been a reasonable thing to include especially since it was $10. I'm pretty sure tossing in a piece of pita bread wouldn't have put them out of business. \n\nThe restaurant was quite busy so obviously people enjoyed the food but we found it to be overpriced and bland. It wasn't bad but I expected something better than the Olive Garden of Middle Eastern cuisine.",

Almost everyone at our table enjoyed their meal & the one who didn't is a picky eater & disliked a particular spice. Great ambiance & Ana was a fantastic server! Also, if you park in the Hilton garage, bring your parking stub & your server will validate it for you for discounted parking! Not too shabby!",

  "text": "I'd have to agree strongly with the review by Bixley on 12/3. Went there yesterday evening (New Year's Day) and figured that maybe the inadequate service and medium burgers coming out charred was just on account of being there on a bad day. I mean, who really wants to work on 1/1 anyways?\n\nI went there with a fairly large group considering the space, my party was seven people - all of which ordered a burger aside from one po'boy sandwich. And of those 6 burgers, 3 of them were the Kelly's Burger - and I'm pretty sure they were all requested as medium. Not sure what part a charred-tasting extra-well done patty is considered medium, but mine was most definitely not medium. The fries that accompanied it also appeared to have been diced, perhaps I just got the shaft with bottom of the bag crumbs or something. The fries were also seasoned, which was great but probably bad for some as I don't think I saw any indication that they'd be as such on the menu.\n\nThe food not living up to my expectations could have been forgivable if the service had been better. Our waitress ran back and forth without so much even asking out of courtesy as my group of friends grew thirsty with empty water glasses. It's not like the place is huge or anything either. There's what, 6 or 7 tables max?\n\nWilling to give the place another shot on account of having a good beer selection and the hopeful promise that if done right, their burger could quite possibly be one of the best. But for now, 3 stars is probably too generous and forgiving.",

Unfortunately, that's all I have to say good about this place (hey, I needed a reason for one star instead of zero.) When my friend and I were promptly sat, our drink and food order was taken. It took about 45 minutes to get our sushi. One would assume a food you don't cook shouldn't take more time than a well-done steak. Mind you, as we were waiting for our order, people who had sat down 20 minutes after we did had their dinner before us. The food was mediocre. Honestly, I get better sushi at Dierburgs. Long story short, if you are hungry, don't come here unless you can mask the hunger pains eating Sweet & Low like I did.",

  "text": "My beau used to live NOLA and I've visited once before. We both like a good oyster po'boy. Patrick's isn't too far from home, so we made a trip over for a late lunch. We each ordered an Oyster Po'Boy: beau got a large with a side of chips and I got a half with étouffée. Be warned, the full sandwich is HUGE. My husband ordered it with the intention of taking the other half home. \n\nThe Po'Boy is one of the best I've had in awhile. The oysters are fresh, had a great flavor, and were crispy. The seasoning has a good kick, but not too much (I'm a wuss when it comes to spicy foods). Beau loves spicy food, so he added some hot sauce to his. The bread, which really makes the po'boy sandwich unique, is crusty on the outside, soft on the inside, just like it's supposed to be. \n\nThe chips are thick-cut but super crunchy with some heavy seasoning on them. The seasoning isn't hot--kinda garlicky with paprika, maybe. \n\nThe étouffée is thick and flavorful--a crawfish gravy over fluffy rice. \n\nService was pretty good. Ordering the food at the counter was easy. For lunch, there's no silverware, napkins, salt + pepper, etc. on the table, so you have to get it yourself or have someone bring it to you with your food. Once you order at the counter, you are given your drink (soda, tea, beer, or wine), and sit at a table. The food is brought out to you. \n\nWe will definitely try this place again. Maybe for dinner next time. Now we gotta get some bread pudding to go. ;-)",

  "text": "I've been coming here to get Dr. Grossman facials and eyelash tints for years! My skin and eyes are very sensitive, so usually after a peel or a tint, I'm all pink and gross. However, whatever they're using here is super mild but effective! Lashes always looked lovely without pink eyes and there is no irritation on my sensitive skin after a peel. Now that I moved away I still come here when I'm in town. \n\nThe space is phenomenally beautiful and the owner is always there being adorable and helpful and super welcoming/friendly. She proud of her salon and her leadership shines through in her personnel and space. I could hang in here for hours - and I have! Once I was just chilling sipping on champagne (they'll hook you up it's great) and they offered me a pedicure (not free but they were like \"Want to get your toes done?\"). Oh baby! They pedicure spot is so cute and they did a great job. \n\nNow, I was here last week and needed a New Year's Eve bikini wax. I went with Cydney who is sweet, hilarious, smart, and on that cool girl stuff. I've had so many bikini waxes in my life I can't tell you how hair even grows there still. This was the best. The hard wax they use is thin and the ripping-your-hair-out part was PAINLESS, painless honey! Well if you're new to waxing you might hurt but I was like, \"Hmmm usually painless means not working,\" but I haven't had a single ingrown hair or red spot, and my bikini looked fresh that night (or so I was told, if you know what I mean-what I'm saying is I got laid people!). She also waxed my legs - painless. \n\nSupport local CBD business! Support women who are business owners and independent money makers! Support Cydney she's amazing, especially if you need a wax. You'll love Buff's prices, people, parking options (some meters but some free spots around), and the space itself. \n\nTake it from me, folks: I spent a lot of time and money in salons (yes I'm broke whatever) and this is my favorite in New Orleans and THE WORLD!\n\nI recommend an appt on the weekend/in the evening so CBD parking is easier.",

The wait staff is friendly, beer selection teriffic, the burger are great and the sandwiches are very good as well.  If casual laid back friendly service and good pub grub food is what you are looking for, you will find it at Becker's. \n\nThe owners also appear to take an interest in their customers as well. If you sign up for their mailing list, and provide the month and day of your birth,  you will receive a birthday gift in the form of a coupon for a free appetizer and dessert.. Nice touch.",

It's the only place where a quick, inexpensive meal that's made with real food can be purchased as far as the eye can see. Think of it as a fast casual version of Mongolian BBQ.  Pick a starch, a meat, veggies, a sauce and they grill it up for customers. \n\nThe interior setup is awkward with customers having to cut the line in order to fill their cups with ice and tea, which are positioned opposite each other. Besides that though, I'm a fan. \n\nI ordered the subtlety spicy finadene chicken with brown rice, broccoli and mushrooms and left not even a grain of rice in the bowl. I finished it off with a piece of crazy good carrot cake, and washed it all down with some u sweetened tea. With the tip, it cost me about $15.",

I can go pickup a large 2 topping for under $9 tax and all, there's not any other pizza places around town where you can do that. I haven't tried any of their other food as I'm perfectly content with pizza. They've got one of the best marinara sauces I've ever had and their mozzarella cheese sticks are mouth watering.\nIf you haven't caught on yet, I'm a big fan of this place. I highly suggest you go try it out if your around town. You can do take-out/delivery/or dine in. They have a good size dining room with servers who tend to you. If you go on a weekend sometimes they have a live band or singer on the stage. That's right,  they have a small stage as well. Good times. Go. Try. Enjoy.  -TnT-",

How is it possible that the food can be even more delicious every time? I don't know, but Khmer Kitchen makes it happen. My sister and I got the fried calamari again, the weekend special which was a coconut curry soup situation, the lemongrass beef stir fry made extra spicy, and the caramelized pork. Sigh. Just wonderful. This time the lemongrass beef was tender and delicious! And wow...they weren't joking about the spice. We might have to go down a few spice levels next time. Basically everything I wrote before about the dishes we'd already had rang true this time as well. The surprise was in the weekend special. Wow...it was everything we didn't even realize we needed. The flavors were complex, warming, with a hint of sweetness and spice. I loved the giant, soft chunks of potato and carrot. My goodness, it was delicious. \n\nI love this place. I will take everyone I care about here, and you should too. \n\nOh yeah, our waiter is always awesome! Really attentive and doesn't mind that we ask for a million bowls of rice :)",

  "text": "I had been here a year or two ago and enjoyed the atmosphere and my services, and decided to try Glossy 130 out again a few weeks ago when back in the area. Sadly, it didn't live up to my previous visit, and I won't be returning. \n\nThe Good: \n\nEasy to make an appointment. Guy at the counter (the owner? Not sure.) was very friendly and welcoming. Good polish selection. Nice touch with offering a drink during service. \n\nThe Bad: \n\nBad ventilation; smelled like chemicals - you know, that \"bad nail salon\" overwhelming smell. My tech seemed miserable - barely spoke, in monotone, and was extremely rough. Started with a pedicure, and she cut me accidentally on the first toe. Seemed rushed and inattentive. \"Massage\" of feet / legs with pedicure was actually painful - in a \"I feel your nails digging into my skin\" way, not a \"you're working out knots\" way. My pedicure took 10 mins less time than the person who started the same level of pedicure right next to me at the same time, logically because my tech was clearly rushing - I was ok with that, though, as I just wanted the grumpy , rushed service over so I could move on to the manicure I'd also scheduled. \n\nIf only it were that simple, though. Nail tech didn't give me any (I have no ide what they're called, so let's call them...) toe-separator-thingees, then had me follow her (walking fast) to a manicure table. Well, in my attempt to follow her quickly, my second toe swiped my big toe, and since the polish was crazy thick and wet, the polish squished away from about 1/5 of that toenail. The guy from up front (owner?) happened to notice and told the tech to fix it; she leaned down to do it under the manicure table where she either thought I couldn't see or just didn't care if I saw her remove the polish and do only one single coat of color to replace it - no base, no second coat, no top coat.\n\nThen we moved on to the manicure - no option for me to select shape; tech started clipping without asking / before I realized to say something. She grabbed the wrong gel color when I selected one from a set of nail examples, though thankfully I caught that. Randomly and with no explanation my tech then left and had someone else take the reigns, who moved me to a new station. New tech was significantly friendlier, so while the switch was surprising and not explained, that worked out better in the long run. \n\nOverall: this felt more like a cliche mall establishment, with the smell, rushed feeling, lack of attention to detail, and seemingly unhappy staff. Maybe it was just an off day for one tech, but I'm turned off enough that I'm not going to try it again to find out.",

  "text": "I found V Street incredibly disappointing.  While I'm neither vegan nor vegetarian, I always appreciate vegetable oriented dishes that push the envelope flavor wise.  I found almost every dish I tried at V Street to rely too heavily on overwhelming spicy, heat.  \n\nA run-down:\nZa'atar Corn: frozen corn, overly spiced :(\nKung Pao Green Beans: too spicy, not well executed\nPeruvian fries: these were the best items we had but I feel that fried potatoes drenched in sauce is cheating (and super unhealthy)\nBBQ Seitan tacos: ok\nKorean Fried tempeh reuben: this was decent \n\nThe cocktails were good.  I particularly enjoyed the Miles Davis in Byblos\n\nAnother strike against V Street: we sat at the bar and were not informed that a food photographer would be monopolizing the space.  We were quite uncomfortable and self conscious that we would be in the shots and we kept having to move out of the way so that he could achieve the angles he desired.  It made for a fairly unpleasant experience.  I would not return.",

The roast beef is cooked to perfection and is loaded with deliciously caramelized onions and melted gruyere on a crusty roll. I wanted to drink the broth provided on the side, but I thought that would make me look like an ass. I had a glass of the Rioja, which was an excellent complement to the roast beef. The atmosphere is also very nice. A bit different from the current offerings on Frankford Ave, but lovely nonetheless. I'll be back and will be bringing others.",

The fries seemed overcooked and soggy (and at times burned). The upside is that the side came with A LOT of fries, so you can easily make a meal out of it. I tried the blueberry cornbread, which was good - but it was a little dry for my tastes. The mac and cheese was a solid option though. This place seems to be known for their drinks/burgers, so it might be worthwhile to come by to try that.",

  "text": "Crazy Sushi is a popular sushi joint located conveniently near the shops of Chestnut St. I have read many reviews of both Crazy Sushi and Vic Sushi (see review) so I decided to try them both.\n\nFrom the outside, Crazy Sushi looks like a typical sushi hole-in-the-wall. When you enter, it quickly turns a bit fancier. Dim lighting, nice tables, clean bathroom - a solid looking restaurant. I dined in at around 5:00 PM on a Sunday and was the only guest. But, onto the food.\n\nI ordered a spicy tuna crunch roll, a mango/avocado roll, and an order of tamago sashimi. The food came out quickly and the waiter was friendly and polite. The presentation was also beautiful. They served my sashimi on a mountain of ice with the rolls to the side. However, I was rather disappointed with the food, especially after reading the reviews. The spicy tuna roll was incredibly dry. It seemed like it was 85% crunchy, and 15% tuna. The avocado/mango roll was actually very good, but not worth $7. The tamago was just okay, would not order it again from here. \n\nAlthough the menu had a plethora of choices, ranging from sushi appetizers (one I recall was spicy tuna wrapped in seabass) to a two page special roll list, the sushi fell short and I do not think I will be returning. These reviews are a bit Crazy.",

  "text": "Ohhh Stella. You rock. \n\nI've been here so many times since they first opened, and every visit has been a pleasure. Family and friends are always happy here. First reason might be because the pizza crust here might be the best: so insanely flavorful, with a perfect leopard-spotted undercarriage indicating expertly tended char, plus the right amount of cornicicione. Secondly, the menu offers diners both the complex AND simple pizza options, and there is no 'bad' choice. The balance of flavors--in the simple Margarita or the epically delicious Tartufo--is always on point. \n\nIt seemed appropriate, then, to celebrate true love over a love of pizza. For our rehearsal dinner, Starr Catering (the BEST!) helped us come up with a delightful menu that made all our guests happy in this fun event space. The antipasti course was loaded with so many options, and served family style, that everyone nearly forgot to save room for the main attraction-the pizza, obviously! We went with the margarita for those who like to keep is simple, the spinach because it's amazing, and the tartufo for those willing to be adventurous. Lastly, our servers began bringing out all the flavors of gelato for everyone to sample. In short, nobody left hungry or thirsty and plenty of pizza was packed up to go back with the boys to enjoy later!",

  "text": "Hutton staff was great. Very friendly and accommodating. The rooms were clean and comfortable. Although it was wonderful that a shuttle is provided to take you within a 3 mile radius, we almost always waited over a half hour and sometimes up to an hour for the shuttle. When we would call we were often given a 25 minute wait time and after 45 minutes of waiting we'd call again and they'd say another 20 minutes. We often ubered it as a result so the amenity of a free shuttle was a moot point. Also, apparently at a certain hour they give complimentary wine tasting. We were never told about that so we never had the opportunity to enjoy that. We happened upon it one day coming off of the elevator. And don't drink the $7 bottle of water in your room, they give you free bottles of water if you ask at the front desk.  Overall we had a fantastic time in Nashville with a few glitches at the Hutton.",

  "text": "SO- I retracted my first review after the owner contacted me in his defense, and since I can appreciate his efforts, I promised to give the place a 4th chance and re-write my review. ( I was a little dramatic, claiming they \"were dead to me\", blah blah blah.) NOW I see that many have been contacted by Brendan; so much for being special!\n\nNevertheless, I WAS able to actually get a seat this time around, though I attribute that to heading over painfully early at 6pm. Still, there were seats to choose from at this point, which was not the case when I had visited before. \n\nI have to reiterate what a lot of low-star reviewers are saying, which is this: West Philly is a foaming at the mouth for any mediocre establishments, and while the beer at local 44 certainly is NOT mediocre, everything else is just sort of okay. The food was okay, the wait staff has been different every time, sometimes friendly, other times just too busy to care, but the beer stands alone.  The fish tacos and french fries are pretty good, but a mayo dipping sauce for the fries would be awesome.  \n\nThis place will stay busy no doubt, and I think they deserve to... but not having a lot of options doesn't mean we have to settle for mediocrity.  And while I may hit up local44 for late-night beer and fries during the week (if space allows,) I just happen to get turned off by hype. And since there are other bars around town with stellar beer AND stellar food, I'm willing to make the trip outside of west philly.  (Though I wouldn't be opposed to another local 44 above 48th street!)",

It wasn't just a little long... it was about 4 inches too long. When I called Yelena she said she could get it done, and that she'd just have to charge me a rush fee (which I was more than okay with.) \n\nI brought it in and she had me try it on... do take the time to do that vs. just telling her how much to take off. The dress ended up being longer in certain places so she really had to pin differently all the way around it. Even with that, though, I had it dropped off in about ten minutes.\n\nWhen I picked it up on my way to the lake for the wedding, I just gave it a quick glance and was happy to see that the new hem line was flawless. Later that weekend when I put it on, I was even happier... it was the perfect length, just skimming the floor. Happy times indeed.\n\nI'm grateful she was able to help me in a pinch and it was well worth the $35. I'm going to bring her a handful of things next week because I've been waiting to find someone who does such quality work.\n\nThank you Yelena!",

There were four bartenders behind the bar, all avoiding eye contact like it would kill them to throw a menu to us. One had air pods in, looking uninterested. The woman who finally gave us a menu after 11 minutes of sitting at the bar was chewing gum aggressively. We had the menus for about 5 minutes with no drinks, hadn't even gotten the chance to order water. We had no problem leaving and going next door, given no one working there wanted our business at all.

So I called Subway which I spoke with the manger about my food being of poor quality. The bread was stale, and shriveled up, there were jalapeños smushed and infused on the outside of the bread, mayonnaise, oil, and mustard everywhere. Sick! to prepare this for anyone. The manager Julie says, \"only I could bring the sandwich up and she'll remake it\" Totally inconveniencing me, but I obliged. I get up there and Julie the General manager has the nerve to give me some spill about how they don't do this, and how she is only going to make a 1X exception. Excuse me?  I told her this service was absolutely poor and that I wasn't pleased. That I should at-least be compensated to a 12\" in sandwich for my inconvenience, since she wouldn't allow the dasher to reorder it. I paid 8 bucks there and back for a lyft, not to mention the door dash fees. For her to act like this service I received was perfectly fine? Look at this sandwich! Mind you the next sandwich they made looked nothing of the sort. You literally have to watch these people to ensure your food is made right. Sick!",

  "text": "I had a hair cut by James on November 13 of this year. I am Nigerian-American and I have natural hair (what naturals call 4c hair texture). I hadn't had a professional hair cut in over a year. The last hair cut I had, I did it myself in the summer of this year. So my hair was in need of some serious love. I went to the salon for a blow out and trim. The assistant washed my hair and then he got to work. \n\nLet me tell you, he is AMAZING!!! He did a round brush technique to blow out my hair with a blow dryer. Then he gave me the hair cut of a lifetime!! Then he flat ironed my hair. I looked amazing!! The blow out alone was fantastic. I had no idea my hair could look like that. Also, James is very, very talented with all hair types. The woman before me had naturally straight hair. The salon etiquette is great. I was given water while I waited. I only waited because I came so early to the appointment (perhaps 20 minutes early), but I sipped my water for about 3 minutes before I was seated for a hair wash. The entire appointment lasted about an hour and fifteen minutes. For my black sisters out there, that is unheard of. James doesn't overbook. So when you are in the salon, you are the only one there and that makes you feel special. The experience was so soothing and relaxing. I am making an appointment again, and I will recommend him to anyone who wants a bomb hair cut or blow out! \n\nNow for my ladies with afros, don't be afraid to get your hair done. I'm sure you've had some bad salon experiences in the past. So you may be hesitant, but do not be afraid. James knows hair. I have the thickest, kinkiest, African hair. My natural hair is an afro. He handled my hair like he works afros in his sleep. I am telling you. This man is a hair wizard. I got the hair cut of a lifetime. It looked amazing on my straightened hair, but when I washed my hair and got my curls back... WOW! I fell in LOVE with my afro all over again. The shape is perfect for my afro. I don't know how he did it. He is a hair wizard.",

No apologies when I told them I had to cancel 2 appointments and wait 3 hours longer than expected.  I'm still here.

The only BAD experiences I had was when I was using pain medication, and they were extremely stringent to the point of being rude . But, that was long ago. The pharmacy manager at the time was very kind to make sure my orders were in, as I had an unusual prescription. \n\nHowever, now that I am no longer on constant pain medications I have had nothing but GREAT experiences there. All of the pharmacy techs are kind, caring and efficient. They remember me, which often surprises me, as I am not there often. That makes the place seem like your hometown pharmacy, which is rare in this impersonal age \n\nAnd they never fail to give my service dog a treat, which makes the experience extra special. \n\nI would never use another pharmacy in this area. I highly recommend Walgreens",

Unfortunately, I went back to Spitale's on two different occasions recently and the food has gone downhill. The first time I went back, I ordered the Red Beans and Sausage lunch plate...the beans were beyond bland and the sausage was tough and rubbery. I could heat up Blue Runner beans and cook sausage at home and it would taste better than the $12 lunch platter that I bought. The second time I ordered a salad to go. I know, ordering salad from a deli is dumb, but it's hard to screw up a salad. The veggies were soggy and the chicken was flavorless. I don't think I'll be ordering from Spitale's anytime soon.",

I have been calling for the past 4 months asking them to submit the claim to insurance.  They say that they will, but they don't.  When I call the following month - they say that they didn't submit to insurance since it isn't covered.  I just got off the phone with my insurance company.  It should have all been covered less a $20 co-pay.  I'm just going to submit the claim myself since I can't get Premier to do it.  A friend had a similar situation.

I asked to verify I understood him and nicely said, \"so we have to be sat back down to wait to be seated again because of a 20 minute difference?\" He responded \"ya.. you can either sit at the bar and it'll be quicker either way it depends\", so I then told my boyfriend that we'll just wait. We get up from the table to wait and paid for the virgin piña colada the server just HANDS me the tab and leaves.. I then asked the girls in the front who I'm suppose to pay the bill to and she responded, \"the server?\" as if I knew that because he left us in the front with the tab in my hand.

None of the chefs were Asian.... and I was the only Asian person there customer wise. Not like that's an issue.... but if you're wanting to go to a more authentic noodle/ramen bar i'd suggest heading to china town. The broth for the miso ramen was pretty tasty but the pork was disappointing. It's shredded like as if you were to get a pulled pork sandwich. The pork in ramen is my favorite part of the soup so this was a downside for me. Also thought it was overpriced.

The crab flavor was strong and the corn had a good bite to it.\n\nGumbo- M liked it more than me. He remembers liking it more last year. Not a big fan of all the okra.\n\nShrimp & Grits- Yum! I liked the heartiness of the grits and the sauce was tasty. Good amount of shrimp.\n\nP&J oysters- I didn't have any but M like these a lot.\n\nNow onto the bad. Our waiter was never really around. After having the fritters, we were served the oysters but our table didn't get cleared of the empty basket of fritters. After the our entrees came, the basket of fritters,the oysters, and dirty appetizer plates were still sitting empty on our table. We had not received the gumbo we ordered so someone else (still haven't seen our waiter) brought it out. \n\nWhen Matt was 80% done with his main entree, our waiter finally came to check on us and asked if we needed anything from him. Uhh... Yea! How about clearing the table? Or checking to see how our food was because maybe then he would have known we were served our last appetizer after we were already served our entree. \n\nFood was great, but the subpar service tainted the experience. We did let a manager know on the way out. If our server was around we could have told him too.",

The decor is cool and the building is brick which adds character. What really caught my eye was the \"community\" table. A big long table that you can sit at with strangers. Awesome idea, but we opted for a table upstairs for 2. \n\nWe were seated and a waitress brought us a couple pitchers of water right away. We looked over the menu and I was impressed by the amount of variety in the burgers. I also loved the idea of the burger battle. Basically every week 2 burgers battle and whichever one has the most ratings stays for another week. Very cool. I ordered the California Bison Burger and fries with the house ketchup and house cheddar cheese sauce. \n\nThe burger was incredible. Very juicy and just the right amount of gamey taste. The cole slaw was perfect on top as was the pork shoulder. The beer bun was delicious! The fries were crispy and seasoned which was great. The cheddar sauce was very good. The house ketchup was unique. It was very cinnamonny (Yes I made that word up). \n\nThe water was room temperature which was strange and the waitress wasn't overly friendly or personable. She was just kind of there to do her job, which was fine. Also, for $12 I expected the burger to be a little bigger. But it was cooked perfectly so there's not much to complain about. \n\nOverall this place is awesome! Definitely worth the stop in and we will be back for sure. I want to try a bunch of the burgers from the menu!",

  "text": "Last time trying Kaiseki was in Kyoto Japan and I enjoyed it tremendously. I was glad to find out that Yoichi's offers Kaiseki and I don't have to fly across the Pacific. As a fan of authentic Japanese traditional cuisine, I could not pass up on this opportunity. It was a great find during my visit in the lovely city of Santa Barbara.\n\nThere is definitely a difference when using all five senses of touch, smell, taste, sight, and hearing. The presentation and simplicity says plenty. The main ingredient of each dish were never overpowered but accentuated. Each course is presented with an introduction. \n\nThe staff is friendly just like the service you get in Japan. The experience was unforgettable. Thank you Yoichi's!",

  "text": "We eat here every time we come to Reno. We love the atmosphere, food and drinks. Usually  a hit or miss with the wait staff. Last night however we had THE ABSOLUTE BEST WAITRESS BY FAR!!! JORDAN I believe  was her name ( sorry I forgot after the 3rd beer)please forgive if that's wrong. Talk about \"royal treatment \" she was AWESOME!  I didnt even get this kind of treatment when we ate her in January  for my birthday!  My hubby and son noticed some food  items were gone from the menu and she explained  to us about the new head chef. She asked us what we  usually order and made some suggestions  to try. I ordered my beer (wildcard)and she asked if I had tried any other brews from the menu. I showed her the ones I had tried and she asked if I wanted to sample any others(no one ever asked me that). \nYes please! Big Dog IPA is my new fave!\nThe food was also delicious. My daughter,son and I ordered  pizza and salad. My husband had the street tacos. All were equally delicious. Decent  prices & good portions Of food. I had to take mine in a container as I was full from the beers. We all walked out happy and full ( and kind of buzzed). I made sure to leave her a good tip. We will be back soon!",

  "text": "Another \"Delco Proper\" hotspot! \n\nThe restaurant is totally 70's with orange vinyl booths, faux wood linoleum, wood paneling, etc. The place reeks of smoke, and the regulars monopolize all the counter seats (and they are not friendly people). The waitstaff is normally decent; it's a diner so don't expect much. \n\nIt is crazy how this place is open 24-7 and someone is always there eating something. We once saw a family there at 4am who were talking about how they just finished driving home from a road trip vacation, and all they wanted to do was eat at Tom Jone's, and then go to bed. On Sunday after church it is crazy, and the line is out the door. When we were in our early 20's we'd often have parties and send the late-night people to Tom Jones for some food to sober up. They always loved it. There is something about the atmosphere, reminds me of \"Pulp Fiction\" somehow, in a vintage way.\n\nWhat to eat? BLUE RIBBON, Baby! Last time we bought... for $3.89 you get: 2 sausages + 2 bacon + 2 pancakes + 2 eggs + OJ + coffee + 2 slices toast !!!!\n\nIt is always done FAST and it's always decent diner quality.\n\nBrookhaven is dry so don't expect any booze here.\n\nIt sucks, but CASH ONLY!\n\nThey have a walk-up pick up window on the side, but any time we ever did pick up they never used it.\n\n(This place is so Delco, Tommy Pope's gotta know about it... hopefully we may see a rendition of it in his Comedy Central \"Delco Proper\" webisodes.)",

Even through the hell of Thanksgiving weekend, the bartenders remained cheery and made my long layover a little more relaxing. Beware that the kitchen closes at 10pm. I arrived just after 10 and they were so nice to get me some fries anyway. Unfortunately, the service was slow and the staff wasn't too attentive, despite their happy demeanor.",
