  "text": "I took my car to this dealership to get a diagnostic test done to see what was wrong with my car. I told them that my brake/parking light and engine light was on as well another mechanic telling me I had a transmission problem (my car was making noise) . I was told that because I informed them that three things were wrong with my car that they normally charge $89.99 per problem (yes I said PER PROBLEM) but since it was three things they were only going to charge me $129.99 to look at (first sign). So while I'm waiting on my car to be checked out I start looking at used cars. The sales rep comes over to help me and we start the process of purchasing a used car. He comes back with a price of $500 for my car (which is a 2013 ford c-max energy limited edition) because he was told that the transmission was bad. I asked for the diagnostic test results to show that and he never showed me (he told me that a certified tech informed him). I said let me take my car out of here only to come and find out that it was a water-pump. I will never be taking my car to another dealership.",

The first time I went we got the same waiter who did not introduce himself so I couldn't get a name. He was not attentive or friendly. He didn't bring out our waters for 20 mins. We ordered sushi rolls that are suppose to be $5 each after 10pm and he rang up two meals instead. Our bill came out double the amount! We told him and he didn't make the changes. I will never return to this place and it's sad cause the sushi is so good :(",

  "text": "After my daughter graduated from the University of Arizona in Tucson, I needed to figure out a way to move all her things back to Illinois.  As she has a compact car, renting a UHaul and driving it across the country was not a viable option. I also looked into packing everything up and shipping via UPS or the USPS.  Once again, way too expensive and not a viable option. I looked into one-way truck rentals (Penske was reasonable), but then reconsidered when I factored in the gas, hotels, meals, and 2+ days of driving across the country in the middle of winter.  I finally found U-Pack and knew it was the way to go. The online reservation was simple. I called their 800 number to have some questions answered and found out they even offered a student discount.  The price was very reasonable. I chose to drop off and pick up our belongings to save quite a bit of money. They gave me step-by-step information on how the move would be handled and what I needed to know to prepare for the move.  I knew this was the best option for us.  I had everything boxed in Rubbermaid totes so transporting our belongings into the U-Pack pod was very simple and quick.  They said there was enough room for a one-bedroom apartment and we had room to spare.  We loaded everything into the U-Pack in Tucson (it took about 15 minutes from check-in until we drove out of the parking lot).  Within an hour, I got an email telling me that our pod was loaded onto a truck and had left for our destination.  We expected our pod to arrive 5-7 days in Illinois.  It arrived in 4.  I got a phone call and an email informing me that it was ready to be unloaded. I drove out to the facility in Sauk Village, IL, the following morning.  The unloading process took about 15 minutes from checking in with the office to getting our pod delivered (via forklift) to my car, unloading the pod, and driving out of the trucking center.  I still am amazed at how convenient this was.  I am very thankful that I found U-Pack.\n\nAnother thing to consider:  Rather than taking several trips back and forth to load/unload the U-Pack, I rented a moving van from Home Depot in Arizona and again in Illinois to be able to make one trip to the U-Pack facilities.  They charged $19.95 for up to 90 minutes (plus return the gas tank filled). Home Depot doesn't charge a mileage fee.",

  "text": "From out of town,\n\nIt was our last full day/night in NOLA, so we were just walking around and we happened to pass this place after we finished eating brunch cause I saw the happy hour sign.\n\nThe happy hour is amazing. I can't even explain, you just gotta go see it to believe me lol. \n\nSo we started off with a few beers/well cocktails. And we ended up playing some pool, and then ended up playing a couple rounds of beer pong. Then my husband and our other friend started playing flip cup with the bartender, and it's going to kill me that I cannot remember name! But she was super fun! * the bartender won the flip cup LOL* and they both had to spin the wheel on the wall, hilarioussss!\n\nAfter awhile, she gave us some shots that were called green tea shots? I was super hesitant to take them, I don't do shots like that. And surprisingly it legit tasted like green tea! Then the bartender told me to get on the bar, kind of freaked me out a bit lol. I ended up doing my first body shot! Eek. Was super terrified! But I'm hella ticklish so the liquor kind of went everywhere lol.. oops! After that me, my two girlfriends and another girl ended up on the bar doing BJ shots. My god. It was just a wild time!\n\nDef a new type of bar experience for me and I liked it! If you want to have fun without burning your pockets then go here! It's def a good time and youll def leave feeling amazing!",

  "text": "This new Tunisian-based BYO is a complete makeover of the Thai operation formerly here. The new decor is awash in soft, light blue (what else?) executed with exceptional taste. The overall effect is delightfully romantic, especially for Doylestown, which can use something \"date night\" like this even though the mellow vibe was diminished by a bright sconce light over our table.\n\nThe owners are obviously anxious to please, and could hardly do more to make folks feel welcome. We were warmly greeted, well taken care of throughout, and even given a complimentary after-dinner degustation.\n\nOur appetizers -- octopus and a meatball special -- were absolutely spectacular, fully worthy of a great restaurant. The latter was spicy in the best sense, with heat used to enhance flavor using a delectable mix of herbs and spices from the owner's mother in Tunisia.\n\nWere the meal to end there, Blu would qualify for a major detour and a solid five stars. Alas, the warhorse mains -- lamb couscous and moussaka -- were ordinare, albeit using superior quality lamb and other ingredients. Couscous was too dry and lacking in flavor complexity, while moussaka came off as little more than pleasant comfort food. If you want worthy moussaka hereabouts, try someplace like Philly's Estia.\n\nThe dessert of superior baklava and dates fared much better except for tiny portion size. If you're more than a nibbler, you're better off walking down the block to excellent Nina's or even Nonno's.\n\nThe owner has had long experience as a chef, and given the investment he's made appears to be playing it safe and predictable with menu offerings. Yet, he obviously has talent worthy of much greater things, so in time the main courses may expand to approach the quality and creativity of the apps we enjoyed. In the meantime, best bet is probably to steer clear of predictable menu choices and spring instead for the specials.\n\nWorth mentioning is how clean this place is, and not only to the eye. We noticed that when a table was cleared off where a family with children had been, the floor area around that table was also wiped down.\n\nWe got out for under $45/person, plus tip and wine.",

  "text": "First of all, I am never one to leave negative reviews; I have never felt strongly enough to leave one until now.  At this point, we are beyond frustrated and extremely disappointed in United Van Lines, and I think it's necessary for others to hear our experience before choosing a moving company.  \n\nWe used them for our recent move from Kansas to Texas and ran into problem after problem.  The first issue was that they gave us a one week window in which they would deliver our belongings, then did not deliver them until 6 days after the window closed.  Upon arrival, we had several items damaged.  \n\nJust to name a few:\n-Our washing machine is completely broken.  The knob snapped in half, and parts are loose inside of the washer itself.\n-A large chunk is taken out of our antique, wooden buffet table from England.  There is also a piece completely missing on the front.  This upsets more than most since it is impossible to replace.\n-A chunk of the wooden leg on our couch is missing.\n-The bottom drawer of our wooden filing cabinet is completely broken and appears something got knocked through it.\n\nNote that the people who loaded and unloaded our belongings at our homes were all wonderful and careful.  They were not employees of United Van Lines but third party moving companies.  \nUnited told us that everything was unloaded off of the original truck and then loaded into large wooden crates before bringing them to Texas for our local company to move.  It is obvious that the United employees who loaded/reloaded our belongings were completely careless.\n\nWhile we are able to make claims for these items, it is extremely frustrating and not all of the items can be replaced.  \n\nI strongly advise you to choose another company.",

I called the day before for a reservation, which they subsequently forgot to write down but they still took us sense it wasn't full. All of the staff was very nice and courteous. The rice to fish ratio was off, to heavy on the rice and the rolls were not as tight as we would have liked and did fall apart fairly easily. Some of the sushi rolls were cut so big they barely fit in your mouth. Over all taste was quite yummy though. The spicy tuna was mushy but the rest of our fish was very good and fresh. The absolute best thing on the menu however is their dessert rolls. So amazing! The OMG was totally OMG good! Would recommend for dessert rolls!",

Host service was terrible, we were told it would be a 10-15 minute wait tops. We sat at the bar for 40 minutes with no update until our table was ready.\n\n2. Service was annoying. We were left unattended for the first 15 minutes, confused and hungry. We asked the runner that brought us a wrong order to bring us our server. And when we did get him, he had no idea if we were his table. \n\n3. FOOD. I wish I had taken photos of our table, because all the food was still there! The burger was underwhelming, weird patty, pickled jalapenos, and black shriveled bacon. We also got the french onion soup, wings, and tots. Overall the food was nasty, and overpriced. \n\n4. Last but not least, the management service was dreadful. We told our server how we did not like the burger w/ fries, and french onion soup (which we hadn't eaten). And the manager took off 10% of the burger off because the burnt bacon was apparently 10% of the order.

At night, they put moving light projections on different plants and played very immersive music. It was a very cool experience, and I was happy that they did it two years in a row. Because they reopened the fountains this year, they focused on that for the summer rather than redoing Nightscape, but the fountain shows were really great as well.\n\nIt's always fun to see what they have on display, and it's truly amazing what they're able to do with plants. They have plants that defy what I thought was possible!\n\nFood there isn't amazing, though. Mushroom soup is good, but nothing else we've tried is worth getting again. Maybe some of the ice cream. Anyway, you're there for the plants, not the food!",

We notice 3 booths nearby, which were open and asked to be moved there for a little more elbow room. It was only 2 of us, so it should not have been an issue. When the host came back, he proceeded to take us to the \"back\" of the restaurant  It was cold, no heat,no TVs , etc. They sat us in a booth for 6. It was quite obvious that they did not like our asking for a different seating arrangement   Needless to say I lost my appetite and only my son ate. We will not be coming back here. No one likes to sit with a jacket on and eat. It was quite unpleasant   It seems customer service is not their strong suit.",

  "text": "In my pursuit to find a warm, flavorful soup, on the first snow day of the season, I came to Cafe Nahn. It seems many other people shared my idea because the tiny the restaurant had a 20-30 minute wait.\n\nWell, the wait well worth it. I ordered the beef brisket stew and the caramelized pork belly, with boiled egg and rice.\n\nThe stew was hearty and very flavorful. This place clearly doesn't rely on a pile of salt for seasoning, like I've experienced at other places that serve headache-inducing, overly salted broth. And the beef was so tender that it fell apart. The rice noodles were also cooked to perfection with the ideal bouncy texture.\n\nWhile the pork belly was good, it was well-seasoned and tender, I was expecting something a bit more grand. When caramelizing a protein, I thought the outer portion should be, at the very least, browned with a light or very light crisp on the surface.This pork didn't have the desired color or texture, it looked like it was stewed. Also, the pork belly lacked the star feature of this particular cut: the tri-layers comprised of skin and meat that are joined together by a nice layer of fat. And depending on how it was cooked, each layer lends a contrasting texture. At Cafe Nahn, it appears the chef removed the skin, which was a mild disappointment.\n\n Despite this, the dish wasn't the worse thing and had many other redeeming qualities like the aforementioned amount of flavor and tenderness. Another delicious touch was the boiled egg that was stained the color of the pork brother because it was most likely boiled in the broth.\n\nI will definitely comeback to Cafe Nahn. The customer service and food were both great!",

My husband loves this place for their wings and pizza. Both are excellent. The deep dish pizza is fantastic and incredibly filling, so order less than you think you'll need. Great beer selection, pretty good service. The only thing that keeps us from going here more often is the lack of a host. The whole place is open seating like a bar usually would be, but this place is huge so it seems to me there should be some kind of organization. When we drive by, if the lot is full and we're really hungry, we usually go elsewhere. But if you have time to stare down fellow diners to steal their table when they're done, it's worth it.",

In about 2 minutes. I even wanted to finish the gravy with a spoon. Which leads me to the bad side . . . \n\nBad side: The portion was so small. They were so good but I finished lunch super quickly and was still hungry. For the price, I expected a little more food. I ended up getting a croissant on my way out because I was still so hungry. The croissant was flakey and delicious but that plus my lunch was kind of pricey.

  "text": "My daughter, a student at UCSB rents a property managed by Wolfe and Associates.  After a recent tenant call, the property manager found a water leak under the floor in the crawl space and as a father I was pleased that the property manager took immediate action by having a remediation contractor check for mold, having some internal dampness treated with Tilex (just in case), and scheduling to have carpeting removed and replaced (and subfloor if necessary) within a time frame conducive to the tenants who were finishing up finals. An option was even extended for the tenants to move into a vacant apartment on Del Playa (on the beach) for the week if they wanted to, or to have the new carpet put in over the holidays when the tenants were away on break.  You can't ask for much more than that.  Bear in mind that a property manager is often constrained by the demands of the property owner.  Fortunately, our Winders property owners see the long term value of doing right by good tenants and providing a safe environment for student tenants.  I was very pleased how Tom at Wolfe & Assoc. and the property owners handled this situation.",

She isn't vegetarian or vegan, but couldn't stop raving about this place. Me and my friend went to have dinner on a Friday night, to catch up on life. The ambiance is very relaxing, the owners come and chat with you as you're waiting for your food. Our server Jesus was fantastic. Very knowledgeable, and sweet. He was constantly checking up on us. If I had my own restaurant, I'd definitely hire him. \n\n\nThe food was fantastic. The menu is very limited, but all the options sound amazing. You also have the option of doing a four course meal. Soup, salad, main course, and dessert. They were also running a trio special, appetizer, main course, and dessert. \n\nI had the trio which had jalapeño poppers, pumpkin cranberry pecan tamale with rice and beans, and then dessert was some kind of banana loaf (don't quite remember). \n\nI highly highly recommend this place, if you're vegan or not. The flavors are fantastic and vibrant, and the presentation is amazing too.",

However the services are somewhat overpriced but generally good quality. After a few years we turned to another source for our yoga. \n\nThey offer Hatha, Relaxation and other varieties of yoga practice. Nashville seems focused on hot yoga.\n\nOur automatic payment permission was revoked multiple times, with emails that went unanswered by the owner and then after we revoked the credit card authorization they continued to charge us $80 per month...for 3 more months. Despite trying to reach them they continue to charge. I'm disputing this currently as fraud. \n\nBeware Unity Yoga!

We make a point to bring our out of town guests here if they are wanting the Greek experience.\nSince parking can sometimes be tricky down on the docks (or at least cost you $3 in one of the parking lots), it's nice to know that Hellas has a parking lot behind the restaurant. If you ask the waiter for a parking pass, you get to park for free :)\nTonight we went in for a late 8:30 meal. There were a few other diners in the restaurant but not overly packed. I ordered Pastitsio which came with peas and rice - $14.50 and plenty to bring home for left-overs. Very good flavor. Peas were canned peas seasoned with a few spices and tomatoes but to me, still tasted like canned peas - not my favorite. The pastitsio was very good, however. The hubby had a chicken souvlaki ($8.25) which he devoured and a glass of wine ($10.50). With my Coca Cola ($2.95) our bill came to $38.74 with tax.

Well, last night was one of those days as I was in the area and decided to stop. \n\nHave to say, I really loved it there. My girlfriend and I split a cheesesteak and fried pickles. The cheesesteak was very high quality and had very good taste. I felt the steak on the sandwich was a higher quality than the other notable Philadelphia cheesesteak spots. The roll was also very good which overall made the sandwich a home run. It was also cheaper than the other places as well. \n\nThe fried pickles were very very good. The pickles were the chip type and they had a lot of breading on them. They were bigger than usual and very crispy. I have been thinking about them all day.  \n\nThey have a very big menu so next time I stop we are going to try more stuff!\n\nTip: They don't have a bathroom, so don't come on a full bladder. They also accept credit cards, which I found quite convenient.",

  "text": "This is a pretty cool local bar. Went there on a Monday night, not a lot of people there at all. Bartender was good. We just had a few beers. They have a takeout beer section too. Highlights: 2 small size pool tables which were really nice. All the cues were pretty beat up though. They also had a shuffleboard table and dartboard. I didn't eat there, so I'm not sure how the food is. My experience was average. Since then, I've been here about 4 more times, pretty much only to play pool. It's a dive bar but the upstairs is pretty cool when it is open. (Usually after 7pm) They have another pool table up there too.\nUpdate- we come here all the time now, honestly, the experience is hit or miss depending on the the bartender. Most are cool and do a great job, but some are so terrible it makes me not want to come back.",

We have seen white some coffee shops in Boise but always tried to stick with what we were familiar with, Starbucks, until we tried this little local owned coffee shop 3 months ago.\n\nThe coffee is rich and perfect to the taste.  I always like mocha or latte type of coffee.  Doesn't matter what flavors I ordered, they were just perfect to my taste.  The flavors will not overwhelmed nor too sweet than the coffee itself.  I just ordered a holiday special \"Snowball Mocha \" (I think).  Marshmallow melted on to of the hot coffee, it is rich but the bitterness of the coffee underneath it just make the coffee perfect (although I am not a big fan of marshmallow, I think this combo makes them perfect together).\n\nI had a chance to stepped inside and it is such a cozy welcoming coffee shop.\n\nGive this little place a try.

  "text": "I have heard mixed reviews about Massage Envy. I tried it out for the first time a few days ago over the holiday my family all bought me gift cards to Massage Envy. They all went at once to get the massage card and apparently the promotion that has been running this month if you buy $125 worth of gift cards you get a free 30-minute upgrade on a massage an hour or longer. Well, my family all did by more than $125 worth. However, they did not give them the 30 minute upgrade because they all bought their cards individually although at the same time. You would think an establishment understanding it is all holidays and that a family was there buying gift cards individually to give to one person they would honor that special. I was told about it whenever my gift cards were given to me so I ask about it when I went in. Well, the representative messaged her manager and apparently the excuse that we got was the corporate office was writing them hard about who the issue the gift cards to. I would think the corporate offices main objective was to retain and leave a customer satisfied and wanting to return. I was buying gift cards the same day as well because prior to this experience I had agreed with another co-worker to get one of our co-workers a gift card to Massage Envy and I was picking up the $125 gift card to give them and get the promotion. They were fine giving me$125 gift card to give to someone else. However, even though they could clearly see that all of the gift cards were purchased at the exact same time and they were over the $125 value the management of this establish willing to honor a request that could have encouraged a customer to switch to Massage Envy as their primary therapist agency. However, I am going to finish out my gift cards and I'm going to continue with the same Spa I've used for years. I get one massage a week and I have been getting that for years. I did however decide to use one of their other promotions since I had such a high-value and gift cards they were offering a membership for 90 days and I decided to do that membership and buy it with the gift cards I bought 125 where I could use the upgrade given for myself I'm future massages and the gift cards that were given to me I'm going to gift to our co-worker and the amount of $125. The sad thing is the reason my family chose to try Massage Envy was the fact that that promotion was running and they know I typically get a two hour massage and they thought it would be beneficial. However, when they refused to honor at they worse kind of SOL because they had to buy the gift cards because a spot I typically use a closed already for the season. I can tell you that once my gift cards expires and this 90-day deal I will not use Massage Envy again. However, I can say that my therapist was amazing his name is Arnie yeah and he was very good with his hands he did what he describes as sneaky deep. I like a mixture of deep tissue and relaxation massage Swedish type combined together. He did it better than anyone, I have ever met. If this was the only factor in my decision I definitely would have stayed with Massage Envy. However, it is important for Massage Envy to know a great therapist is only one factor when a customer chooses to become a long-term customer of their business. Also, my friend Christian  and I went to have a massage at their sister location days before and he made to request that they work on his legs in his glutes because he was having severe pain and muscle spasms and they work on his feet and briefly work on his back. The therapist didn't work on his glutes at all just skimmed past his weights did not do his feet I'm focused almost 100% on the massage on his back and shoulders when he asked for that to be the least. Plus, he is slightly a larger man and he was forced to hold his head up during the massage because they wouldn't give him a pillow after he requested hello twice. What he did was pull the headrest off an attempt to use that and that didn't even reaches head that kept falling off and the therapist would just leave it in the floor so when I would look over at him he looks so uncomfortable because he was holding his head off of the bed and he was clearly uncomfortable I could tell from my bed and His Hands kept moving and the therapist would put his hands on his hands and tell him to relax. He asked for a Swedish massage and they gave him more of a deep tissue I swear to God he said how or ouch 15 or 20 times during that 90 minute massage. The put us in a a couple's room which was not requested we were just request that they schedule is at the same time and I am assuming that they thought we wanted a massage together and that was far from the truth. So, this made my massage awful even though my massage therapist was decent not as good as Arnie however still very good. Christian ask that a manager follow up,  he said  manager never called. Honestly, it was a complete waste of $100 for each of us.",

Perhaps the best time to go is after the busy lunch hour or right before dinner, when the kitchen isn't rushing and food doesn't sit out for long periods. \n\nLast night, we went during dinner time and I overheard a few people complain about the amount of time it took to get their appetizers. The servers took a while to take our order and get refills, but they were friendly. My chicken was so dry and the batter was burned. I'm assuming they made a bunch of nuggs ahead of time and maybe reheated them in the fryer, because they were so over cooked it ruined it for me. My tots were stale and cold. I could tell the servers had a rough day so I wasn't going to complain. Like I said, the first time I went the food was to-die-for and it wasn't during a busy time.",

When I came  home there was an over the range microwave oven sitting on the counter.  We have no way of using an over the range as our oven is freestanding with no cabinets or anything to install it. I tried taking the microwave back to get a refund as it was over $350 (which was ridiculous for them to sell that to him to begin with) but was told there were no refunds or exchanges. The owner suggested I try and sell it on eBay or Craigslist. Later our AC unit got a busted freon line and my son called Atlas repair out to fix it. They came and charged my son around $500 to fix it. Although it is running, it was barely blowing and after running continuously for a day and a half, it was still 76 degrees in the house. I called them to tell them it still was not working. Its now been 4 days and they still have not come to fix it!",

  "text": "Ice cream in December? When it's OwowCow, the answer is always a resounding YES. \n\nThis place prides themselves on their locally sourced product. Everything is made or procured locally, and it really makes a difference. Sure, you're going to pay a little more for a cone here, but you're supporting multiple local business and getting a delicious, organic treat that's free of the extra garbage corporations will add in. It is SO.WORTH.IT. \n\nThey are always trying new flavors, so you can easily try something different every visit if you'd like. The kids behind the counter here are super friendly and will happily give you a tasting of any flavor before you get stuck ordering something and don't like it. \nThey are peanut free here, which is cool for all the peanut allergy folks out there. \n\nLet's just say, I don't think you can go wrong here. The house vanilla is still my favorite, but I also have not been disappointed in any other flavor they offer. They have a ton of topping choices as well- my fav being the chocolate \"chips\". I don't know what planet these hunks of shaved chocolate would be considered chips, but they are the perfect pairing for the vanilla. \n\nBunch of fun cone options here too. Waffle cones with fancy dipped treat edges- from cookie pieces to candy bits. I usually just go with a cup because I can't finish the regular size on my own, but if you want a challenge, go for the waffle. \n\nThe fridge at the counter is also full of local drinks, pints of their ice cream, and various to go treats depending on the day. They offered ice cream pies and ice cream sandwiches on my most recent visit before Christmas. \n\nOwowcow, I love you. I wish I could pack you up and take you home to South Carolina with me! I will, however, stop in here every time I'm in the area!!",

Perhaps I miscommunicated my expectation that this would be the case while on the phone with them yesterday morning. I ordered for a late afternoon pickup figuring I could serve the meal as soon as I returned home.Unfortunately, I arrived to find the ham and tri tip roast I ordered were not only unheated, but in the case of the roast partially frozen. \n\nThe person who helped me explained this was normal and reheating would be a simple matter, the work of about 30 minutes at 300' oven which I verfied with the detailed written heating instructions. (Nice)\n\nI arrived home and immediately set to the task of reheating the items following the instructions to the letter. Sadly the time allotted was not sufficient and the meat was not 140' internal even 45+min later. I had to serve after a full hour when the thermometer showed the correct temp. However the meat was chilly in places and I was embarrassed in front of my guests. :( My oven is an efficient and well serviced machine utilizing both convection and regular bake settings so I doubt this was the issue.\n\nI would definitely consider using Boise bistro again as the taste was awesome. I would simply suggest more friendly help and more specifics during phone order placement.\n\nThank you for reading :)",

The salon was very nice and well decorated and clean, after signing in they offered me tea, coffee, or water and gave me a warm neck roll while getting my nails done. They were very friendly and talkative which I loved and my nails look amazing! They were much more professional than a lot of other places and they offered 25% off until New Year's Eve. Definitely my favorite place and I will for sure be going back.",

After no answers on both calls, my wife went to the store at 9:50 and got a bunch of flack for coming in so late and ordering breadsticks...some guy with a nose ring walking around all huffy completely being rude because we came in 10 minutes before close.  I get you don't want to stay late, but maybe he should have answered the phone 15 minutes earlier.  I wonder how much business they lost due to this disgruntled employee.",

Happy and engaging staff, clean common facilities and room was spacious and equipped with a full fridge, microwave and stove top. Hotel gives all guests free breakfast and happy hour (with wine or beer). Neither of which is the greatest but both can double as whole meals meaning during your stay if you plan right you'll only have to pay for lunch! Gym and pool are small but both serve their purpose. Great location on the edge of the French quarter and walking distance to everywhere worth going. Not sure on parking charge but when you're this close to the action we only rented a car to go OUTSIDE of the quarter on a couple tours. Lots of games in the lobby and a convenience store on the block behind hotel. Overall pleasant and although on the pricey side still worth it.",

Literally needed it. I flew up from GA, and I was cold and felt a cold coming on. I searched Yelp per usual and decided on the place with the best reviews that was in my direction of travel and stumbled upon this place.\n\nI was greeted promptly and told I could sit where ever I wanted. Nicole was my server. She was great and super attentive and if I heard correctly it was her birthday!  She worked on her birthday and was in the best of spirits. It made my day. \n\nThe restaurant was small, but very cozy, super clean and the service was quick.\n\nI ordered Pho with shrimp. I requested veggie broth but this restaurant only has beef :(. I have to admit, this threw me off. Only beef broth? Don't get me wrong it was still good broth, but did not mesh will with the shrimp. Speaking of the shrimp, they were not deveined (in case you are that person like me that doesn't like to see the inside of the shrimp while eating it). Also, I do believe the shrimp might have been frozen (they were not as flavorful as fresh never frozen shrimp usually are). Aside from that, all of the fixings were set out nicely and Nicole made sure that I had everything that I needed. \n\nUpon departure, I was asked about my experience. The team seemed very interested in what they could do to make their customers experience better. I inquired about the fact that they only have one type of broth for their Pho and it was explain to me that they did not want to compete with their next door counterparts which cater to vegans and vegetarians. I completely understood, yet thought to myself, its not competition when you're doing your thing. Give people what they want ;), I want veggie broth in my Pho this season.  \n\nOverall great experience. If they ever get veggie broth or if I become a regular meat eater I will return. \n\nI do recommend this place, the experience and service were both great.",

Not the biggest selection of food so if you're looking for a hearty meal i probably wouldn't come here, but I've had a cheesesteak and quesadillas here and they were decent. It's really the atmosphere that i love, just a no frills bar which is my kind of place. Love the brick!",

  "text": "One of my favorite places in Seminole Heights!   The inside of this place is just so cute.  There are plenty of tables inside and a couple benches outside if you want to eat here.  \n\nAs far as the food goes, I am seriously addicted to their acai bowls.  I think I probably stop in once a week for a bowl.  I loved all three of their bowl options.  I usually gravitate towards the Whatever bowl which has light and fruity base, although sometimes I will get the cacao bowl which has a hint of chocolate in the base.  They have a lot of different toppings which are all are spot on - fruit is fresh, granola is crunchy and the honey is local!      \n\nI will also come in here for some gelato or a pop.  My favorite pop is the earl grey lavender lemonade.  So yummy!  Whatever pops is a great place a sweet treat or a light breakfast/lunch acai bowl!",

  "text": "We had just finished up at The Wilson County Bank in Gladeville having pictures with Santa along with all the cousins. I have an idea! Let's go to Providence in Mount Juliet and eat burgers! Yeah, let's just hop on over there and have dinner real quick...\n\nIt is about 5-ish, so we head that way from the Gladeville community. We zip along on Stewarts Ferry Pike to South Mount Juliet Road. Cool! But THEN we hit rush hour traffic along a lonely two lane highway - well not THAT lonely as traffic was backed up almost from Stewarts Ferry Pike to Central Pike. I'll wait until you pull up Google Earth before typing any more...\n\nDone yet? It's a long way isn't it? It takes about thirty minutes until we crest the hill after Central Pike and see the lights of civilization. We get to the restaurant around 5:45 - again - ish. I put in our name, give my phone number and await the anticipated text message which I was told would be 20 minutes. They appear short on servers at this burger place as several tables become vacant. Eventually others are sat - people that appear to have come in after us. I approach the host - \"I'm sorry, I entered your phone number wrong - we have been trying to get in touch!\" Someone in the 615 area code just asked his wife, \"Did you order a table? It's ready!\"\n\nThis turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Our daughter notices the man behind the bar as someone she knows - one of the managers. She knows his wife and knows that just yesterday he was suffering from an extreme stomach bug.  So I'm trying to get us a decent table and my wife says, \"We are leaving!\" Wait? What?! I'm about to score us some free food!\" We get outside and they explain why we are leaving. \n\nWhat now? Mexican, Chinese? Me, \"What about Cori's Dog House?\" Silence. Again, \"What about Cori's\" No response. \"I said what about....\" \"We heard you - just hoping you would get the hint.\"  Someone mentions Indian. \"Cori's has an Indiana Hot Dog!\" My lip stopped bleeding in a few minutes, good luck getting that blood stain off her coat sleeve, though. \n\nThis was our first visit as well as our daughter to Persis Biryani Indian Grill - you probably forgot by now which restaurant I was reviewing. My son-in-law had been along with our one year old grandson about two years ago - just seeing if you were paying attention. Were it not for the food and obvious ethnicity of the staff, you would not know you were in an Indian restaurant. The inside is sleek and modern with lots of stone, modern chairs and white laminate - bright, but pleasing. We were sat immediately. Indian food has flavors that appeal to a certain palette. Or if you are like my wife you had some really bad Indian food a few decades ago and never gave it another shot.\n\nThis time she goes WAY out on a limb and orders the Saag - just kidding - she gets this every time - she also locks her car when it is in the garage - so go ahead and analyze her. They have butter chicken AND chicken tiki masala which I had thought were the same, but were different here. Here they use ghee instead of just run of the mill butter. It imparts a nutty flavor - slick, huh? I read it on their wall. Our daughter orders the butter chicken - now it is her favorite to date - and Indian food is now her favorite. If you follow my reviews - and who doesn't - you know that she or my wife thought they wouldn't like it. There is the aforementioned reason in regards my wife and then there is her negative influence on her daughter all these many years. I am surprised DHS didn't pull her from our home, but she is almost 30. Daughter's husband orders the avocado curry, medium spice. He loved it! Now me - I tried to explore and decided to order the restaurant namesake dish - biryani. I get it with chicken and find that they don't have degrees of heat when preparing this dish. A slight language barrier with the server and he was finally able to explain that to me - I was asking what spice level - he was saying no spice eleven. He assured me it was spicy. It comes with riata yogurt and pepper gravy on the side. It is a large portion of basmati rice and lightly breaded chicken.  Good, but I would probably not order it again. I find I prefer the dishes that are sauce heavy. Good, but different. We ordered garlic and bullet naan. Bullet naan is very spicy! The garlic was delicious as well. Our daughter loved dipping the garlic naan in the sauce of her butter chicken. I did too, until my wife told me to leave her (our daughter) some...\n\nKid's meal is basically boneless tandoori chicken served with either white of fried rice or noodles. Lots of green onion so you might tell them to lighten up on that - otherwise the one year old ordered that - spicy level 3 - kidding. We said we might get the kid's meal next time. Our daughter had to tell her husband to leave him (their son) some...you women! It was that good. They leave a carafe of water at your table which is good and our server was great, but MORE WATER!",

We love any restaurant by Stephen Starr so we thought what better way to celebrate our new marriage by coming to his new restaurant the Love! We had reservations and they were t ready for us so we waited at the bar. I splurged on the \"$20 Manhattan\" which was $19 which is a little ridiculous because I don't even think they cost that much in Manhattan but the drink was delicious. My husband had mad elf to start and he tried their wheat beer which was pretty good. To start I had the duck salad. Thank you. The flavors went so well together and the duck was cooked perfectly. My husband had the coconut curry soup and the scallops. I tried both and they were delicious but the real winner was the short rib stroganoff! So amazing! The place has a cute atmosphere. We came on opening weekend so it was a little busy but we hope to come back many more times!",

We were starving...they did give you 1 drink ticket each for the bar upstairs. We were able to snag some seats at the oyster bar. Now be prepared, you may end up smelling like charcoal but Greg, who prepares and cooks the oysters is AMAZING. \nThe restaurant is definitely understaffed. No question. We were on our second dozen of the oysters before they even came over to take our drink orders. \nWe ordered po' boys and some char broiled oysters for dinner. Po boys were fine, nothing to write home about ! We had the BBQ shrimp po boy, it's a huge sandwich and they literally scoop these little\nShrimp into a hero.  No lettuce or anything, but the sauce is good. But the oysters were AMAZING! They are by far the best ones I have had in NOLA. Just come here for those around lunch if possible but skip the dinner here ! Not worth the wait time \nIf it were just a review on the oyster bar, I would say 5 stars but the service and po boy were a 3 star.",

We had the cheese plate (choice of four) with homemade fig jam and olives. It was a perfect starter. Hubs had the filet and I had the French Onion soup and a salad. Soup was delish. Steak was good but not great. We were both satisfied with our meals-- 4 stars for sure- close to a five. The restaurant is quaint and cozy but could benefit by a tiny bit of an upgrade (like framing the 70's mirror on the wall in the dining room). Overall I definitely recommend this restaurant but with a few tweaks it really could be a straight up five star experience.",

But they are affordable, durable and unique gifts!!! I thought I've only seen Swatch stores in expensive malls, so I automatically assumed it's an expensive and overpriced brand. But I learned so much today. The saleswomen were informative and super helpful. Swatch is an international brand with stores all over. They replace your watch batteries for life and the batteries last 2-3 years...awesome! For the kids watches, the parts don't come off and the surface of the watch can always be  buffed out if they get a scratch on them. The kid's watches are essentially waterproof cuz they can take baths in them and you can even throw them in the washer if they have the cloth bands and need a little extra cleaning. I walked away with two different watches for my son and two watches for my two nieces. Great priced gifts for the holiday season!!!",

This time they were showcasing micro cars.  Loved how the showroom was set up.  No overwhelming and so many cars to look at.  The garage tour was also very informative.\n\nIf you love European cars, this is the place to go!",

I never received a statement in the mail or via email for the amount that I owed beyond what I paid at the time of my visits and on my procedure date. To my surprise, they quickly sent my account to a collections agency which I paid once I received the bill from the agency. Their billing dept is in LA and the person I spoke to there did not have any information for me.   I still have not received an itemized statement from them.  Very frustrating experience on the billing end, but my procedure was successful and again the staff and doctors are wonderful.  Hopefully they will improve their billing process.",

The chips are homemade which are ok, but dip was creamy with good flavor.  Wings, as I ordered ribs, I should have tried a different flavor.  They were heavily sauced.  Sauce is sweet with heavy vinegar base.  Reminded me a little of Tony Romas.  For entree, my wife had tri-tip and I had ribs.  Tri-tip came sauced, same as wings.   Smoke ring was ok, but meat a little dry.  (Happens with smoking)   Ribs reminded me of backyard ribs.  Same sauce with blackened flat side and fall off bone.   \n\nMac and cheese was homemade and star of sides.  Cole slaw was a little sweet, but balanced.   Beans have a strong ancho chile flavor, but are also sweet.  \n\nService is attentive.   Will be back to try pizza.",

I have always loved this Courtyard due to its out of the way location and absolutely beautiful interior, I truly love the lobby area!\n\nI am witnessing a trend at this hotel though and that is with the room cleaning staff. I know that they have a job to do, but I have never stayed at a hotel that matches them for aggressiveness. The last time we stayed here they kept bugging us about when we would be out of the room, we finally just requested a late check out to try and solve the issue.\n\nWe stayed here last night, didn't get in until pretty late due to a flight delay. By 9:00 this morning they were knocking on the door trying to get in to clean the room. I guess they thought my Wife was the only person in room so as I was trying to get in the shower, she just walks into the room, no knocking just opens the door, I thought it was my Wife coming back into the room it was that quick. I honestly don't know what the deal is with the room attendants here! They truly need to knock before entering a room, don't assume that there is just one person staying in that room.\n\nI guess if I stay here again I will have a \"Do not disturb\" sign on the door the entire length of my stay!",

  "text": "I really enjoy going to Katie's PPO. This is my first time visiting this particular location, and I have to say- I like this location more than the Rock Hill one. For one, it's closer to me. But overall, I just think it's so dang cute. It's more spacious too, which is a bonus because I think the Rock Hill location gets a little cramped. \n\nThe food here is just as good as the Rock Hill location. I hate to not be adventurous, but I always get the arugula reginette. I had it my 2nd time at the Rock Hill location, and I have been getting it ever since. It's a delicious choice if you are a mushroom lover. I typically always have a little bit leftover for a light lunch the next day too, so that is a bonus. \n\nMy one complaint is just the prices. I personally just feel like the pizza and the pasta are pretty pricey. Pretty pricey pizza & pasta (say that 5 times fast). But in my honest opinion 18-20 dollars for a pizza just is high to me. I guess if you were splitting it with someone, that's not bad at all, but if you're out to eat with people you're not spilling a pizza with, 20 bucks just seems crazy. Obviously, people are willing to pay it. I mean, I am paying $20 for pasta with mushrooms. But whatever. I look at somewhere comparable like Pastaria, where there pizzas hit around the 13 dollars mark and the pasta hits around the 16 dollar mark and I wonder why the prices are so high here. \n\nOverall, I can't complain about the quality of food and service though. They are always really on point every time I have visited. I hate spending 20 dollars on a pasta for myself, plus and drink or app you really start to get into around 50 bucks just for 1 person. KPPO does't blow me away, but I'm sure I will be back.",

  "text": "I really REALLY wanted to like this place, especially after reading all the great reviews on Yelp. Unfortunately, it just wasn't so. The food wasn't terrible but it also wasn't great. If I had to sum up the meal in one word it would be SALTY. I'm not a bland food type of person, but all the food that my husband and I ordered today was pretty salty. \n\nMy husband and I arrived to the place around 1:30 and luckily it wasn't super packed. The place is really tiny but very well decorated and very clean. We were able to get a table right away and we were greeted right away by the host to ask if wanted tea or water.  The servers were very friendly during our entire time there, and they were great with all customers from what I could see. \n\nWe ordered the cha gio for appetizer and the regular bun bo hue and the banh mi dac biet for our main meal. The cha gio looked really good, and they didn't use much (if any) taro as a filler unlike a lot of other places,  and I really appreciated that. They tasted really fresh and pretty good although a bit salty. The spicy fish sauce vinaigrette that they serve with it was also on the salty side. The banh mi was OK--surprisingly small, not a lot of meat filling, and they don't put the pickled veggies on the sandwich which I thought it desperately needed. The bun bo hue was what I had high hopes for, though, since it seems like everyone raves about it. As soon as it came out I tasted the broth--great pork flavor but other than that it was salty and didn't have enough lemongrass. My husband though the meat was a little over cooked and on the soft side. I was a little let down since bun bo hue is one of my most favorite noodle soups.  \n\nI'm not sure if we went on an \"off\" day but I just wasn't won over by any of the food. Props for the great decor and excellent service though.",

Fortunately, as everyone was home for the holidays, we were able to wait until the day after Christmas to try and get someone to come out. I left a voicemail on Christmas just to be sure.\n\nWithin 15 minutes of them opening, I received a call back from Cindy to schedule someone to come out. Cindy was amazingly nice and explained the whole process to me with how their services work. They DID NOT charge a service fee to come out to look at it which was great, especially with the various contractors our there charging an arm and leg just to come out. They were able to get someone out within one hour. \n\nBy some miraculous event, the power was on as I came to the house to meet them. The house must have hear Generation 3 Electric is coming to town. The inspector was still kind enough to look around and try to diagnose what may have caused it. While there was no apparent reason for what may have caused it, he still did a thorough walk through. \n\nI am usually uneasy about working with some contractors as I feel many try to get the most money from you and up charge for services. This was definitely not the case. I cannot speak for pricing as we didn't have anything done but am definitely using them again if I have any electrical issues (hopefully never).",

When the waitress finally came over she said the hostess never told her we were there! She offered a free appetizer so we asked for a queso and pulled pork dip and chips! About 20 minutes later the manager came with a plate of tater tots and said they were all out of pulled pork . The tater tots were dressed with green onion which I won't eat and bacon my girlfriend won't eat. She ask us if there was anything else we would like. We asked for a different plate with green onion and one side and bacon on the other . About 15 minutes later they brought out a new plate. Our food order arrived about 10 minutes later. After we finished eating the waitress came and picked up our payment. When she turned to the table she tried to inform us that the restaurant isn't a seat yourself restaurant. My girlfriend told we didn't seat ourselves the hostess did ! She started to argue with my girlfriend. The management needs to pay closer attention to the operation on the restaurant. Food was mediocre at best ! Will be along time before we return.",

Ticket price varies and costs about twice as much online.  The show I attended was during a week night and online pricing about about $35.  However, you do get a reserved spot on the bench.  I waited inline for half an hour and bought ticket the door for $15.  It's standing room only, but that's great since it's easier to dance.  \n\nThe venue is much smaller than anticipated with 3 rows or bench seating and the rest is standing room.  You can bring in outside beverages since they do not serve alcohol.  There is no restroom, but you can use the ones at Pat O'Brien's next door.  You won't want to leave for the hours or so of music that you'll experience here, so make sure you go before the show.  You can take pictures before the music start but not during.

  "text": "Disappointed. Came in on Monday 12/11/17 around noon. Name was put on the list. Wait was short. Was helped by Jesse. Told him I needed a cell phone for my daughter, as well as insurance, and a cover because she broke her screen and phone was glitching.  (Problem 1) A lady walks in the store and interrupts us. Rather than telling her to sign in and wait for the next employee to help her, he leaves me standing there while while he assists her with her question.   After the interruption, he proceeds to ask me how old my daughter is. I said 22. (Problem 2) He said \"well tell her to buy her own damn phone.\"  I explained to him that was not an option at this time. Then we started looking at phones.   I asked him about buying the phone rather than installments. He looked annoyed at me and said \"well we don't do that you have to buy it from Apple.\"  My husband texted me about an offer for BOGO on IPhone 8. Jesse said that was only for adding a new line. My husband did not see where you needed to add a line to get the BOGO offer. Said that to Jesse. He said \"listen I have been doing this for a long time and I know what I'm talking about.\"  I told my husband via text again.  My husband said tell him to put it in writing  I told the rep what my husband said. Oh boy. Things got uncomfortable.  (Problem 3) Jesse became impatient and angry. I apologized for any problem I was causing. (mind you at this point I was also frustrated with my husband, but as much as that frustrated Jesse, he failed miserably in basic customer service).  (Problem 4) He put the IPhone back he had taken out for me and just walked away. I told him I wanted the phone. He said \"well I put it back and need to wait on other customers.\"  Coincidentally at that point someone walked in he clearly knew he said \"Hey\" and started taking with them. Apparently that was the customer I was holding up (or maybe a friend he was going to have lunch with ). I told him \"clearly this is not working for you.\"  I left the store. No sale.  His customer service skills are unacceptable.  Even if a customer is challenging, you should never just blow them off. He was condescending right from the \"tell her to buy her own damn phone\" comment. I have been an AT&T customer for over 10 years and felt like I was such an inconvenience for this employee.   I won't be going back to this store.   Frankly I don't think I will stay with AT&T. No longer under contract.  They can lose my phone sales and wireless business at 185.00 a month. There are many other wireless companies. I will try another place that hopefully won't get upset if I am not an express transaction.  FYI. I truly don't believe I was in the store for more that 20 minutes from stepping in and waiting to walking out.",

My wife navigated us to the hotel, where we found parking out back.  The part of town didn't seem that rough until we realized we couldn't get into the hotel because the doors had locked and you needed a key card to get in.  Small problem-- we hadn't even checked in yet!\n\nThere was an unexpected parking fee of $30/night added to our tab, which we were only informed about after we checked in.  This got us off to a rough start with the whole trip, but being 11pm and not being familiar with the area at all, we just went ahead and opted in for the parking.\n\nThe elevators are really slow, and it seemed like only one of them was operational.  The room seemed clean, but unnecessarily small, with the bathroom sink right next to the bed.  The bathroom door slides shut without a lock.  It's an odd feature that I'm not a fan of at all.\n\nThere are a few notable pros to this place, namely the short walk (about 10 city blocks) to the French Quarter, the free Wi-Fi in the rooms, and complimentary breakfast, but on the whole they can't save what's otherwise a mediocre experience.  While we were having breakfast, some lady was arguing with the concierge because they changed her reservation without telling her and were trying to move her to a smaller room that wouldn't accommodate her family.  It was really disappointing to find out.\n\nI didn't encounter any of the bed bugs that other people reported, but I wish I'd read some of these reviews beforehand, because I would have avoided this place.",

  "text": "Welcome to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn! Mazzaro's is an Italian neighborhood under one roof. You got the Pork Store, the Bakery, the Bread Shop, the Wine Shop, the Butcher, the Cafe, the Deli, the Grocer, the Coffee House and a Gourmet Pizzeria all within walking distance. Always busy, a daily visit, can't find parking, loud and long lines. Everything I miss from Brooklyn! There is just too much to describe here. Suffice it to say, it's a must visit to fully appreciate. From warm fresh made mozzarella to fine Italian appetizers to fresh breads, cookies, pastries and coffees, it's an adventure to visit. I can spend an hour or more every time I go in and always see something I didn't see the last time. One warning, it is expensive, so check your available balance before going in. I can quickly spend a hundred or more in minutes, but that's exactly the way it was in Brooklyn as well. It's nice to know there's a place I can go to get ANYTHING I desire as an Italian food junkie.",

The people that work at Frist bring in wonderful exhibits and have fabulous events.\n\nToday I was there to just get my kids out of the house over Christmas break. There is a great kids area on the upper level called Martin Art Quest. There are so many fun educational activities for kids and adults to do! You can make screen prints, paint, create reliefs, sketch, read, build, use magnets to make cool wooden creations, etc. my kids range from 2yrs-6yrs and all three were able to find activities. \n\nFrist also has some amazing exhibits. There is one now about WW1 and I look forward to returning without my kids to view it. \n\nFrist has some really neat events. Last year I went to their Prohibition gala and we got to dress up in 20's Garb and they had all kids of yummy food and adult drinks and music. So fun! \n\nI need to take an architectural tour of the Frist one month. The building is Art Deco and amazing!

  "text": "Finally went to Short Hills Deli since the fire. It was finished almost exactly the way it was before the fire and year plus being closed. The menu was very close if not exactly the same too. The only addition was the pickle bar. It wasn't all that great. The health salad was chopped finer than cole slawbut had a good flavor. I would have preferred the old deli way-sliced cabbage, red and green pepper and onions. The cole slaw was too creamy and definately not made in house. The pickles were just a little too overdone for my taste. The bowls and plates were so small that you either could only get two small pickles on the plate or go back for multiple helpings. I had a pistrami sandwich labeled thick sliced New York cut. They need to take a trip to NYC to see what hand sliced pistrami looks like. The rye bread was too soft almost white bread. The good news was the flavor of the pistrami was well above average. The pepper rim was just right with a fine grind and very slight peppery taste. My dining partner had the turkey with gravy, stuffing and potatoes. The turkey looked to me like sliced deli turkey breast. Not a fresh in house cooked breast. The gravy was certainly out of a can and very salty. My companion said the plater was just okay. He like the barley mushroon soup.\nThe waitress was extremely pleasant and several levels above the staff I remember. Prices have gone up considerably. The Sunday breakast is now over $50 and says it's for three people. I could do better in Harolds at exit 10 of the NJ turnpike \nProbably will go back but not very quickly or often.",

That's not the case with Commander's Palace for us. Having just eaten a big breakfast at the French Quarter, we decided to take the streetcar over to the Garden City area for a stroll. Receiving a tip from a streetcar passenger couple that we could get three 25¢ martinis with our lunch entrée, we decided to drop in to check out the menu. We were quickly roped in to sit down after receiving jingle necklaces on our neck by the very hospitable and lively hostesses welcoming visitors for the holidays season. Despite insistent warnings to our waiter, Argyle, that we were not hungry and would like to split our order, the level of service by him and his crew (Julien & Jamie Lynn) remained as courteous and attentive as ever. We observed a very well-organized and well-communicated operations by the restaurant staff on the second floor. Our split orders of turtle soup and pork loins lunch special were tasty and plenty for us to share. Best of all we got to try all three of our 25¢ (melon, cosmo & commander's) martinis with our lunch order. No wonder this place is an institution in the beautiful Garden City residential neighborhood.",

  "text": "Wanted to like this place. I love a good burger joint with a nice beer selection. Went there on a Saturday and found the place relatively busy, but we were seated right away. The restaurant was clean, inviting, and the wait staff was very nice and attentive. The menu had several delicious sounding burgers and appetizers. We ordered the fried pickles and the pretzels between 5 people. There were maybe 12 total pickle chips to the order. Most restaurants serve you a giant basket. That's what I've come to expect from a fried pickle appetizer. There was only -3- pretzel sticks in the order. Not impressed by this. \n\n4 of us ordered burgers, each chose a different one. No one was particularly impressed, but I'll keep this review to my order. I had the Pacific burger which had an Asian slaw, a couple of sauces, and some nice sounding fresh veggies. I upgraded to the wagyu beef and had them cook it medium rare. The order came with my side of onion rings... exactly -3- onion rings. In what world is that a side of onion rings? The plate looked half empty. \n\nTook my first bite of the burger, about 1/3 of the patty broke off and tumbled out the back and onto my plate, along with a stream of various sauces and juices that turned my plate into a sloppy mess. I realized at that point that i was committed to completing the meal with the burger in my hand, because there was nowhere to put it down that wasn't a swimming pool of sauce and grease. The patty was extremely bland. My guess is zero salt was added to the patty before grilling. By my third bite, the bottom of my brioche bun had disintegrated into a moist sloppy mess and completely fallen apart. At that point, the meal is basically ruined. \n\nThere are at least a half dozen better burgers within a 3 to 5 mile radius of this restaurant.  All that potential in the menu is wasted with the lack of attentiveness in the kitchen. Had the patty been seasoned properly, the appetizers and sides been the proper size, and my burger constructed properly, this would have been a completely different review. Such a shame.",

The servers attend to you with Southern grace, and every detail of your seating is to create that special ambiance and romance.\n\nI will say that despite their best efforts, there were flaws.  For one, drinks took an eternity to come, and luckily arrived just before the first course.  Our dessert and nightcap drinks also took more than a 1/2hr to come!  And moving on to the food and drinks, clearly some are better than others...\n\n1. Tequila Mockingbird 2 $13 \"an original creation of Commanders... we liked this drink so much we named it twice. tequila and lemoncello combine to create a tart treat you so nice you'll order it twice\":  Refreshing and very tart.  Smooth.  Good tasting though not complex.  7/10\n\n2. Kessler Riesling 6oz $11.50\n\n3. Garlic Bread (complimentary):  Soaked in butter.  Did not skimp on the garlic, and there's tons of spices and cheese.  7/10\n\n4. Cast Iron Seared Redfish Cake $13 \"blackened redfish cake with shaved winter vegetable salad, peppery argula & rum barrel hot sauce aioli\":  Resembles a high-end crab cake, but substituting fish.  Soft, yet many textures including julienned vegetables.  Creamy consistency, with some horseradish. 8/10\n\n5. Turtle Soup $8.50 \"a Commander's classic finished tableside with dry sherry\":  Can't come here and not get this.  Just do it.  No, it is not amazing tasting.  The turtle is really dry for one.  Though, that sherry does add quite a bit of complexity.  Well, just gotta try it.  7/10\n\n6. Caramelized Pumpkin Salad $9.50 \"Covey Rise Farm pumpkins with petite greens, Belgian endive, pecan tuile, brandy soaked grapes with artisan cheese and Satsuma-cane syrup vinaigrette\":  Delicious!  Crisp vegetables against sweet pumpkin and fruit.  Love all the sweet crispy things on top too!  10/10\n\n7. Pecan Crusted Gulf Fish $39 \"a Commander's Palace classic with crushed corn cream, spiced pecans, petite herbs and prosecco poached Louisiana blue crab\":  Well, I'd have to say, it's a ton better than I was expecting.  Often nut crusted fish just ends up with a dry and hard breading.  But in this case, they kept the pecans light, and was not offensive.  The sauce is a bit sweet and very rich.  The fish flesh was pretty good, but was just a tad tough and could stand to be cooked less.  8/10\n\n8. South Louisiana Seafood Stew $36 \"a rich seafood stew of Gulf fish, poached local oysters, wild white shrimp, a popcorn rice boudin cake, with a charred tomato-chili broth and roasted trinity garnish\":  Well, I kinda object to the name--this wasn't a \"stew\" at all.  I mean, I guess they can say the sauce is a stew.  Anyway, the fish is savory with a crisp skin.  Some flavorful mysteries in there too.  Loved how perfectly the oysters were cooked, nearly raw but just enough, and ultra tender.  The oysters paired really well with the rest of the dish.  6/10\n\n9. Sweet Potato Milk Punch $9.50 \"we combine milk and vanilla to a perfect balance of creamy goodness. next, house-made spiced rum spiked with sweet potato is the kick you won't want to miss\":  AWFUL.  Cannot taste of that sweet potato whatsoever.  Tastes pretty much like sugar and milk mixed with alcohol.  Perhaps a super watered-down egg nog?  2/10\n\n10. Limoncello $5\n\n11. Lally's Praline Parfait $8.50 \"hand-crafted vanilla ice cream layered in an old fashioned parfait glass with candied pecans and sticky praline syrup, Lally Brennan's favorite dessert\":  OH GOD... perhaps best sundae I've EVER had!?  So luscious.  That house-made ice cream is decadently luxurious, and paired with the pralines... heavenly!  10/10\n\n12. Commander's Bread Pudding Souffle $9.50 \"all the richness of Creole bread pudding whipped up into a light souffle, finished tableside with warm whiskey cream\":  Hmm, this one is tough.  It's not really a \"souffle.\"  More like bread pudding with meringue on top.  Really mushy bread pudding.  My gf didn't like it.  But personally it worked for me.  It was served really hot, and the sauce clearly had plenty of alcohol.  Most bread puddings are too... bready.  But I think this dessert made good use of the bread.  8/10\n\nSo, there were mishaps, and not everything was the best example of cooking.  But overall, it was a beautiful night at a very special restaurant.\n\n5/5\n\n#neworleans #creolecooking #gardendistrict",

There's no food served here which means by law they allow smoking inside. Definitely takes you back to the days of old when you would come home smelling like an ash tray. Prices are decent and offer several shot specials for $2-3, even on Fri and Sat night. Because of its proximity and prices it definitely beats a lot of the other bars in the area but could stand to eliminate the indoor smoking or offer outdoor alternatives.",

They told us that the company they got the furniture from is out of business, BUT they would help us get to a satisfactory solution. \nWe asked either to have them replaced or repaired. \nUnfortunately they did not do either. - the best they could do is sell us replacement chairs at their cost!!!!!

Of course we declined!!! what a sham!!!!\nNeil the manager, was obviously not interested in a satisfied customer.",

These food included scampi shrimp, preassemble sandwich, Korean salmon, and more. I like the coffee bean by weight. The wine selection is a bit less choice but good enough for the evening. \n\nPastry is freshly made for your pickups. Many organic item in the fresh produce includes the veggies.

But we had to ask for forks, I was surprised they expected us to use our hands for messy fries? But they gave us some and it was fine. The falafel gyro was good, but the falafels were a little hard.

There were about 35-40 boots selling food, German trinkets and Gluhwein. Gluhwein is a warm mulled wine. I'd definitely recommend getting some; it will warm you up on a cold night and at $5 a glass (or more if you want a souvenir glass), how can you say no! Walking through the market, sipping Gluhwein, watching people skate while listening to a band play Christmas music was a great way to spend an evening! \n\nI went on a Wednesday night and it not overly crowded. We waited in line for about 10 minutes to order dinner at the Joe's Butcher Shop Booth. There were not very many booths selling food. For next year, I'd recommend having less booths selling trinkets and more booths selling food. \n\nChristkindlmarkt is a great addition Carmel and the other holiday festivities around Indy!

As I walked in, I was greeted by a smile and the greeting of the day. I was then ushered away to my table by a nice young man named Dung Tran.  While we waited for our food, I noticed that all the workers were constantly walking around asking the patrons how their food was and even engaged in conversations. Not one worker was sitting down. \n\nOur waiter, Mr. Tran, was quick on his feet to get our drink order and even answered questions swiftly as if though he was the cook himself. \n\nOur food, even though it arrived quickly, was  lacking certain ingredients. Upon arrival at the table, our waiter, Mr. Tran, quickly recognized its deficiencies and apologized. Mr. Tran summoned the manager and the manager quickly corrected the problem. \n\nEven though I told the manager and waiter that nothing should be done, the manager insisted on giving my breakfast free and even came out with additional sausage patties.\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant for any meal due to the service and professionalism of the workers and leadership who run this establishment. \n\nPS: the food is also pretty delicious!!

Not a big job--just a hood repaint--but they treated me like I was in there for a $5,000 job. The paint job was perfect and the entire car looks new. They also did a lot of little things like cleaning the headlamps so they are now nice and clear, cleaning the car inside and even putting tire conditioner on the tires!  I drove away feeling great. Everyone is friendly and nice. Really -- this is the place if you need paint or body work. And NO, I don't work there! Just a very satisfied customer!",

  "text": "One of the best things about St. Louis, IMHO. I was never really into calzones until I ate the food here. \n\nFatty B - like a deliciously cheesy, meaty inside out pizza with twice the flavor. The red sauce (always on the side! Haha) adds a nice little spicy kick. \n\nThe Duke - smoky chicken and bacon nicely offset with the sweetness of corn all wrapped up in a warm, hearty pocket of seasoned dough. \n\nCaesar salad - surprisingly enough, I have yet to find a better Caesar salad in this town. Like for reals. \n\nThe calzones are all huge and I usually save half for another meal the following day. You're basically getting 2 meals for $10! \n\nHaven't dined in at this location, but I've gotten delivery from here plenty of times. Of note, it does take 45 min to 1 hour for delivery since calzones are made fresh and have to bake. They charge a small delivery fee of about $2 that's not a tip for the driver, but the food is so delicious that it's worth it. \n\nPhone service has always been very professional, and we've never had a wrong order after all this time. Delivery employees are super friendly too. \n\nThere's no greater feeling than having a nice, hot calzone fresh out of the oven delivered to your door!",

I would describe both dishes as good.  What surprised me was the small portions.  Like pasta is expensive???  I think their objective is to leave you hungry for one of their divine desserts or gelatos.  Well, it worked.  Gelato was lovely.

  "text": "Tiny little spot right near the train tracks in Elkins Park. Given the very high ratings, I was surprised it was empty when 2 of us walked in at 6 pm on a Saturday night. Although I think we both liked the overall experience, i would not recommend the clams as an appetizer. They were way over-salted and tiny.  The entrees were so much better: pork Marsala with perfectly steamed fresh broccoli and just enough mashed potatoes and covered with ample fresh sliced mushrooms (cooked) in a divine sauce. Veggie penne also excellent. Apple tart with a crumble topping served warm with a scoop of wonderful vanilla ice cream was a highlight. Great cappuccinos as well. Entrees were around $17. It is a byob. I would definitely go back and highly recommend but I would ask for low or no salting and I'd bring my own wine glasses because the ones they provide are large and clunky fake cut glass and are cumbersome and distracting (especially if you bring a nice bottle)\n\nBy the time we left a few more tables had been seated.",

  "text": "Really hungover on this fine Sunday late morning/early afternoon and looking for something besides my typical greasy Mexican breakfast (my go-to). Hopped on Yelp and typed in \"ramen\". Now, Lee House does not have Ramen but they have some amazing Pho. We ordered online (through Yelp) and for $27 we were well on our way to receiving Pho Tai, Kung Pao Chicken, and Pho Dec Biet (I'm butchering this). They do not deliver to my area, even though it's Brandon, but we saved on the $3 delivery fee and got some fresh air! Walked in about half an hour after ordering and the woman was very confused and said they did not have any outstanding takeout orders. After a few minutes, we were able to clear this up that we had ordered online. About 10 minutes later, we were on our way with a ton of hot spicy food! I like that you can order the Kung Pao to your spiciness specifications - we went with Medium just to try it out. The to go Pho was packaged in three separate containers. One for the broth, one for the meat/noodles/onions, and one for the bean shoots and other fixings. The Kung Pao was a rather large portion that also came with white rice. For $27 we have several meal's worth of food, which is great. With so many great options in our area, we really need to get out and explore more and I'm very glad that Lee House made the cut! They have Thai, Chinese, and Vietnamese options so there is something for everyone. Looking forward to trying some dim sum next time!",

It's just a rinse, really. Anyway I ended up with a shaken ouzo/jack Daniels concoction that was more ouzo than whiskey. One sip and I was done. Anyway the food. That's what matters. I had the foie gras, which was fine but unmemorable. I can't really describe it, but it didn't have that melt in your mouth quality decent foie gras has. That was followed by overcooked smallish scallops served over a tasteless risotto.\n\nThis place is more expensive than good.

Although we were greeted after walking up to the coffee register, both employees then turned away--one to go chat it up with people at the other side of the bar, and the other to tidy up the counters and get beers. \n\nWhen my friend finally ordered, the one employee AGAIN turned away and started doing menial tasks while I stood there waiting, trying to get anyone's attention. My friend went to the bathroom, came back, and I still hadn't been helped. She was finally given her order and then the employee turned away from me yet again, but my friend was able to get his attention to let me order. \n\nIt's a shame because the chai latte was quite good--subtle and not overpowering. \n\nBut I'm not going to stand at the register for 10+ mins, being ignored while the bar people get special treatment. Getting coffee should be a fairly quick process. \n\n(Also: there's no food. What gives?)",

Being from NJ, I find myself visiting philly quite often. I have visited CWAS this past September as well as Sept 2016 for a friend's birthday who is vegan. This is some place I would have never chosen on my own but I highly recommend this joint. \nFriendly and attentive staff, sweet environment and decor. If you get the chance to sit in the back sit away from the wall so you can see the cool screen playing old video clips. \nIn my recent visits I have tried the Gin cocktails on special and fell in love. They use such awesome ingredients like ginger and rosemary and I enjoyed the creativeness. \nAs it is tapas, we chose to order almost everything. Standouts were the Bucatini and meatballs and Korean fried tofu. I could have sworn it was meat! The Tofu was crisp, spicy and so flavorful, i could have ordered and eaten it all night long!  The zucchini crab cake sliders were tasty though I wish there was more filling it was too much bun! Try the Bao buns! They won't compare to some amazing one I've tried in Brooklyn, but hoisin sauce is great!",

The manager said the skewers are marinated the night before in a garlic marinade so if you aren't a big fan of a lot of garlic, he said to order the buttermilk chicken skewers.\nThey even have a \"Navy Seal\" burger that has 4 patties.  It was listed for $25.00  My son-in-law was a big fan of the nachos.\nThe service was very friendly and despite the party being so large, Haley managed to deal with it and all the chaos that goes with it.  She always had a great smile and was attentive and accommodating.  \nThe manager came over, just to make sure we were happy.  Great place.\nBe aware, it is a sports bar and can tend to be pretty noisy.  That sort of goes with being a sports bar.\nI like the fact that it's vet-owned and they give military discount.",

There's this really nice waitress who was on point with everything she did. I don't remember her name, cause I'm terrible at remembering names, but she's Venezuelan.. so, there's that. I'm Peruvian and it's very hard to find authentic Peruvian food, in Orlando. It's so happens that I was in Tampa and decided to check this place out. Best Lomo Saltado I've ever had in my life and it's enough to say that you can fight a war over it! I also had the House Chicha, which was great! It was missing some little chunks of apple, but that's a dealer's choice preference and up to your palette to decide. The atmosphere is very relaxed and fancy, which is an interesting combination; I enjoyed it! If you're Peruvian, this place will make your heart content!!",

It had two eggs (your preference of how it's cooked), bacon or bison sausage ( I chose bacon), and roasted potatoes. I add a blueberry pancake with the order for a $4 upcharge. The pancakes were delicious! You also have the option of paleo pancake too. \n\nAnother favorite of mine is the Hot Chicken sandwich for lunch. It's very savory and decently spicy!

It was surprisingly busy but we had a reservation and didn't have to wait.\n\nI like the idea of all you can eat meat, but when you are eating it and dining here you generally feel terrible. The food is VERY salty, they say you can order no salt meat but you will have to wait. That doesn't seem worth it when you are here. Our waiter was clearly busy with other tables and we weren't drinking so its possible we weren't the most important group.\n\nA few cuts of meat never made it to our area, we were sitting in a back room and its possible the filets with bacon don't make it that far. It is an experience for sure, but I think Fogo de Chao is the best at this game. \n\nThe beef ribs might be the best thing they have, other than the Brazilian Cheese Rolls.",

  "text": "5 years ago my family and I stumbled on this place looking for somewhere to eat dinner after walking around the city for the holidays. We were beyond impressed with the food, so much so that it became a tradition to come here every year. All of the food is fresh and delicious and the roast pork sandwich is out of this world. The staff has always been very friendly. Over the years, my family has grown and this year we came in with a party of 9. We arrived around 3pm on a Saturday, December 2nd and it wasn't very crowded, however, the hostess was very rude and abrupt with us saying she didn't have a table big enough to accommodate us. There was a large table by the front window which she told us was reserved. We asked about combining two tables together like we did last year and she said that wasn't allowed. We asked how long of a wait it would be to seat us at the large table or if there was any other options and she said no and she couldn't give us a wait time. She was very rude and unaccommodating. Unfortunately this place lost out on our business that day and we won't be returning next year. If you have a large group I would not recommend going here.",

After buying at the other dealer I returned once to Glanzmann for service. Again they were totally professional and I had no problem with the service they performed. However the accommodations for those waiting for service are sadly lacking. The waiting room is glass-walled and with the sun pouring in 15 people sat there shading their eyes unable to work with their laptops or to see the television screen because of the glare. There was no coffee or even hot water available during the two hours I was there on a Monday morning. Reading material was limited to two copies of The Inquirer. There were no facilities or space for mothers who might have to bring their children with them. From now on when possible I will seek service at another dealer a half-hour further from my home.",

I would have expected a lot more from the Desi Vega's brand. \n\nFor starters, the burger that we received was not what we ordered. We realized this quickly because our burger was supposed to have blue cheese and fried onions and the one we received had cheddar cheese and raw onions. Our waitress took it back to the kitchen. When she returned with what we thought was a new burger, it was simply a \"remade\" version of the first one. They added blue cheese and fried onions. So our burger was filled with onions and had way too much cheese. Unacceptable if you ask me. \n\nThe fried pickles were so greasy I didn't even want to eat them. The French fries were not cooked well and the potatoes were so hard. \n\nUnfortunately, I won't be making a trip back here. Desi Vega's, you've got work to do with this location.",

  "text": "Arana falls squarely in the \"not too bad\" category, which is not really a rave review. Its hit or miss, and that's the problem. Their guac is yummy. Their chips warm and crisp. Nachos are good. Tortilla soup hits the spot. Drinks hit the mark of fruity, boozey and fun. \n\nBut once you get deeper into the menu, the cracks become apparent. For starters, a lot of their tacos are just not that great. The spinach and mushroom taco was downright bad, greasy and paltry looking. The fried chicken taco was way more breading than chicken. The burritos are pretty forgettable. \n\nFor happy hour, I'm happy to swing by and drink delicious half price margaritas accompanied by an appy or two. But I would never come here for dinner. \n\nAnd also their menus - yes, the physical paper menu itself - is truly tragic. Or as my friend said when we sat down and were handed menus, \"This is sad.\" The menus are so old and worn down that they are LITERALLY illegible. They're so faded that you can't read what's printed. Not only that, but they're sticky and dirty. Honestly, a menu like that makes me suspect that management is not enforcing a clean environment and that the kitchen is quite likely filthy. I worked in food service for years, and wiping down the menus was part of the closing tasks that we did nightly. I doubt Arana ever wipes their menus. What they should do is THROW THOSE THINGS AWAY and order new, legible menus. I know this seems petty, but menus are the first thing a customer is handed when they sit down and a sticky, dirty, old menu makes me wary of the establishment in general and whats going on in the back of the house. Seems like such a simple thing to fix!!! Details people, details.",

I took a gamble on this one among others but figured my Italian heritage would not let me down.....it did not!\n\nA busy Monday night for sure. Place was hopping. I had no RSVP but got seated right away as my dining partner came just a bit after me. We got 2 glasses of red wine right away and then ordered from the totally awesome MACRO BOWL menu they have which is a intentionally healthy, macro counted, BYO bowl for the health nuts of the world like me who love to eat well and delicious when eating out. Kudos to Billy G's on this! \n\nWe did 3 bowls. Two 6oz sirloin and one 4 oz sirloin. It was the perfect amount for 2 people as the helping of rice and veggie is a bit slim and we both felt a bit more veggie could be added to the dish to round it out a bit better. You can pick, chicken, sirloin, tuna or salmon as your meat and then brown, white or wild rice as your grain. All cost $12 accept tuna which is $14. You can do 4 oz 6 oz on each as well.\n\nThe service is great, friendly, never leaves you hanging and even joked with us when we asked for a picture, great guy but do not recall the name. \n\nOverall great experience and good food with good prices. From what we say coming out of the kitchen and passing the long table of people next to us, there is some seriously good eats to be had here!\n\nThey have HD TV's all over the place as well so you can catch the game as we did during dinner.",

  "text": "First off, I'll have to admit to having a bias since my wife and I frequent their sister restaurant in Maple Shade called Yokohama. That said, Tuna Bar is a tremendously hip new addition to the Philadelphia restaurant scene. The food is of excellent quality and presentation, while the restaurant is chic with a New York City vibe. \n\nI actually ate there two nights in a row so that I could get a true taste of the cuisine.  The Wok Kampachi Ceviche was excellent but my favorite was the Scallop Crudo.  You should try Grandmom's Wonton Soup, which is a creative new rendition of the old time favorite that I highly recommend.  I even had my favorite roll, the Sindy roll, which I eat at the Maple Shade location. It was delicious as usual. \n\nThough Tuna Bar may borrow some rolls from the Yokohama menu, make no mistake, the food at Tuna Bar is original, upscale, and very creative.  The menu is evolving as it is perfected, and getting better by the day.",

  "text": "Been coming here since I was a little girl and they have amazing Greek food. The food gets 5 stars, but service brings the overall rating down to a 3. A year ago I went in with my mom and we ordered a Greek salad for two. A waitress immediately interrupted my mother and I and asked us if we were sure we wanted the bigger salad because the two of us probably could not finish it. At first I was taken aback by such a comment as it is not the waitresses/waiters job to tell me what I should and should not order. However, it never happened before so I didn't make a big deal out of it. All was well, until I went back again with my mother yesterday. Like always, we ordered a Greek salad for two. I proceeded to continue with my order and as I was stating I wanted a chicken souvlaki, the waiter didn't even let me finish before he said well if you are going to order more food maybe you shouldn't get the bigger salad. It'll be too much for you two to finish. Okay, are you kidding me? Is this a rule in this place? A rule that says you need to tell customers how much food is enough? This isn't alcohol we're talking about, you can't cut me off of food. The salad is not even big when split between two people. It is disrespectful that the waiters and waitresses are even making suggestions like that. It is rude, and mind you I'm paying for a bigger salad rather than a small one. Larger bill=larger tip. Better service=better tip. Simple as that. If I get asked this one more time, I might be convinced that it is a rule to tell people how much food is enough in this place. \n\nP.S. some people enjoy leftovers.",

The market itself was fun to look around but there wasn't enough to make a day of it. I saw everything I needed to in about an hour and it was a 45 minute drive to get there, from the south side.\n\nI think adding more seating and adding more booths to the area would have made it more enjoyable. I loved the IChe skating rink in the middle, I think it made a great focal pointe. \n\nParking wasn't as bad as I thought it would be and the lines weren't that bad for a Sunday afternoon. \n\nI hope they continue to host this event and work on adjusting it because I think it can be an awesome event !",

I tried to buy it from small local shops, but they were all out (tells me how good it is), so I had to buy it from a BIG chain.

  "text": "(This is pretty much copy and pasted from my Washington Square West review, but with the addition of one more sandwich and a comment on the interior)\n\nGreat quick lunch, not so much dinner. This review is based solely on sandwiches. I've had the:\n* Testarossa: thinly sliced roast pork, pancetta, Claudio's sharp provolone, roasted long hots, and pepperoncini aioli\n* Italian Stallion: fennel salami, genoa salami, sweet coppa, Claudio's sharp provolone, house-made sweet pickled peppers & onions, and pepperoncini aioli\n* Roman Cavalry: Coppa ham, hand-made fresh mozzarella, arugula, olive oil, aged balsamic vinegar\n\nThis place is ideal for people who work nearby and want a quick, tasty lunch. I would not recommend coming here for dinner because they don't pack the sandwiches with ingredients. \n\nThe Italian Stallion: This is not the best Italian hoagie in the city, but it's the best in center city (and if you don't have time nor want to go down to South Philly). There isn't (at least the two times I've had this sandwich) very much meat on it. Claudio's sharp provolone is better than regular supermarket or deli provolone, but it's not that impressive, so I don't know why they're making a big deal and telling everyone that's where it's from. It always tastes fresh, so it's better than getting an Italian hoagie from the Wawa down the block...\n\nThe Testarossa: This is not the place to go for a roast pork sandwich. Again, there isn't very much meat, although it is still quite tasty, and the aioli adds a nice touch that other places specializing in roast pork do not. The pepperoncini aioli is my favorite thing, and I wish they sold it separately in bottles. \n\nThe Roman Calvary: This is basically an arugula sandwich. I've had it twice, the second with extra meat ($2 extra). The first time (regular amount of meat), it was basically one slice of coppa with a mountain of arugula. The second time (with extra), it was only two slices of coppa, and there wasn't even mozzarella on it. I'm glad I paid $2 for one slice of meat but no cheese... Just stay away from the Roman Cavalry unless you really like arugula with one slice of meat.\n\nThe rolls (Liscio's) have tasted fresh the three times I've had Matt & Marie's, and having it toasted adds a nice crunch (highly recommended, although they don't usually ask if you want it toasted, so you might have to request it).\n\nThe verdict? If you don't have much time, and you live/work nearby, come here. If you have a lot of time, you're better off going to Reading Terminal or the Italian Market. I'm going to continue coming here for lunch because the Italian Stallion and Testarossa are great (and I plan to try others), but I won't be getting the Roman Cavalry again.",

  "text": "I woke up on a Sunday morning with a pipe in my basement that burst.  After I turned off the water is called Horizon services since they advertised they are available 24/7.  I spoke to Laura first and gave her the nature of the problem but also included a kitchen sink that had a drain issue (I am already paying for a dispatcher so why not get the drain handled too).  I was transferred to Stephanie who promptly told me TUESDAY between 4 and 8. I stated the problem again advising her I had no water because of the broken pipe.  Apparently she only thought it was a kitchen sink.  She told me to hold and got back on the phone with a TUESDAY between 4 and 8.  Clearly I couldn't go two more days without water and a family.  Very very disappointing response.  The next time I hear a commercial for this company it will remind me of my bad experience and prompt me to tell my story again and again to family and friends.",

Quite simply the best tacos and sopes I've had in the U.S. (and as good as any I've had in Mexico).  It is a simple menu, not dissimilar to a taco stand in Mexico, with limited choices but that which they serve is done exceptionally well.  Even the agua de jamaica (basically hibiscus flower tea with sugar) was a fresh and delicious compliment to the tacos.",

  "text": "I can virtually see the glow of Thai Chef's sign from my driveway, but I've never had an opportunity to try it. When my neighbor suggested ordering takeout from here, I was so excited to have my chance. \n\nTheir menu can be found online, and it's pretty extensive and what you'd expect from a good Thai place - various noodles, rice, and curries. I had a little debacle about what to order, because it honestly all sounded so good. I settled on the drunken noodles, and I was not disappointed. It was a huge amount of food, and it was DELICIOUS. Like, I-burned-my-mouth-because-I-was-too-hungry-to-wait-for-it-to-cool delicious. Had I any self-control, I probably could have saved some for second dinner, but I didn't. It comes with chicken, and I would stick with it that way. I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much with a different meat. My friend ordered Duck Pad Thai. The duck was delicious - crispy, flavorful skin. We were both thrilled with our order.\n\nSafe to say, I can't wait to eat from here again. Maybe next time I'll opt for dine-in, as the vibe is super cute and cozy. Ideal for a quaint dinner out, with private tables separated by curtains in a dimly lit, quiet setting. However, I enjoyed my food just as well on the couch in front of wheel of fortune. Whatever suits your fancy, give Thai Chef and Noodle Fusion a try.",

Was I there?\" I had to go look at the pictures to remind myself of my forgettable experience here. While running errands late one night, the misses and I found ourselves looking for something to nosh on. She, being on a healthy kick, wanted no parts of Wendys, and me, for the absolute life of me not understanding how Chic-Fil-A has become the freakin' Studio 54 of fast food spots, having a line, WRAPPING AROUND THE BUILDING, AT EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY, we wound up taking a drive over to.....Bobby Chez. After missing THEM closing by about 8 minutes, we FINALLY decided; wait; resigned ourselves to the fact that our only option was, B. Good. Full disclosure, I can't stand these artisanal, free range, gluten free, kumbaya, BURGER joints. Its a BURGER. Its SUPPOSED to be fattening and messy, and delicious. I don't need lettuce that was grown in a temperature controlled field and read poetry every Tuesday by an Amish grandmother. And sweet potato fries can go straight to hell. Having my tomatoes being given honorary degrees from Johns Hopkins is just a way to charge me $12 for a burger. Ugh. ANYWAY, we go in to order and I swear to god there was even talk of just HER getting something here and then going somewhere ELSE for ME to get something edible, but I decided to take one for the team. We order and then go sit down to wait for everything. They call \"Matt,\" but apparently the ONLY other person in the store was also named Matt, so they pump faked me on even giving me food. When they called MY Matt, they had me come get half of my food, as they forgot my wifes sweet potato fries (ugh.) They promised to bring them out and we decide to eat in the mean time. I forgot what she got, and had to just now go check their menu online to remember what I got, which was the El Guapo, but the only thing I DO remember about the food was the the \"natural ketchup\" was naturally nasty. I'm even willing to concede that I am just accustomed to regular, sugar laden ketchup, but it was a jarring change that I didn't particularly care for. Whatever.\n\nLong story short, I personally won't be back. If you like to pay a premium to have the flavor taken out of your comfort food, heres your place. It wasn't HORRIBLE, or even BAD, but it wasn't anything to write home about.",

I have submitted complaints several times only to find the BBB unwilling or unable to engage.  Example: when Precision Door left a garage door installation partially completed, BBB contacted them.  Precision stated they would follow up with me, which they did not do.  After receiving another bill from Precision, I followed up with BBB explaining that Precision was continuing to bill me for the complete job yet had not finished the work BBB had been told they would do.  BBB then told me I was on my own.  Some help.  In another instance, I contacted them when I found out the AC company I was dealing with had installed a more expensive AC system than called for by manipulating their Manual J computation rather than using the mechanical engineering firms computations.  So, I spent unnecessary money on an oversized unit, which incidentally is less efficient than a properly sized one, and got virtually the same result from BBB.  So, my assessment is that the local BBB is toothless and not worth the effort to correspond with.",

Each bite tasted like melted butter and breading....with a slight hint of lobster flavor\n- The lobster and prawns were sitting on a bed of matchstick potatoes, so my food kept slipping and sliding as I tried to cut it\n- I had to say \"Please don't take my plate, I am still eating\" twice\n- Surprisingly, my two dining companions ordered steaks and were asked how they wanted them cooked.

The owners said the cat doesn't stay inside at night but guess who I saw at night chilling on the couch in the common area--the cat. Family run, but they acted like it was their first day running the business and they were gruff and anxious. Breakfast was good at least, French cuisine with a side of cat hair. I cancelled all subsequent bookings and went to stay at another place.",

We were sat almost immediately and were soon greeted by our waiter and someone to fill our glasses. \n\n Their wine specials were incredible ($5/glass) for happy hour, and they had a large array. I essentially liked their wine list because it wasn't too extensive, but I still felt like I had an impressive number of choices. \n\nWhen I went to order - I asked if anything could be made vegan - and the waiter said \"absolutely nothing\" thankfully he was kidding, and HOOKED US UP. For our meal, we decided to share 5 plates (we needed to order 2 more after the 5th dish came out) and all of which were delicious. My favorite dish was definitely the flat bread with mushrooms. I mean, can you go wrong with some carbs?\n\nAfter everything was said and done our bill came out to $125 so I was almost floored at that price. We left satisfied and tipsy so I couldn't have asked for anything better.",

At times, the server was outstanding, food arrive at right temperature and all at once and any side dishes or condiments arrived either before the food and right with food so we didn't have to wait to eat until everything was there.  Other times we have and the server was horrible.  Some dishes were right temperature but others at the table were cold or had sat warming until dried out. It really wearing on our loyalty. Either we get great service or terrible service, not worth the drama anymore but the food is good.  Noticed they change \"Managers\" like people change underwear.

We came here for brunch and ordered: fisherman omelet, hangover hash, and sombrero frittata. They overcooked the eggs as we wanted over-easy for the hangover hash, but the spicy siracha mayo complemented the dish full of sausages and potatoes to add a little flavor. Sombrero frittata didn't amaze me since it has avocados mixed into it and a side of toast that was a like biscotti. The dish was pretty bland and I was expecting avocado slices. Fisherman omelet was a nice portioned meal but a little seasoning would be great my friend asked if it had came with toast, the waiter said yes, but none was served.",

Because in Chicago or Toronto there are enough Chinese people so that the restaurant doesn't have to pander to non-Chinese people's taste buds. Here they don't have that option and have to be given a pass.\n\nThe food is not bad but is sometimes overly salty and overly sweet to suit the tastes of locals. There's no delicacy that you would find in the previously mentioned Chicago or Toronto, but it is what it is.\n\nThis place is still better than the countless pizza, burger (\"gourmet\" burgers), and brewpubs they have in Carmel.

I had a lapse for three years ( just healthy I guess ) and went this past week. I'm still so very upset by what happened I can't stop thinking about it. Dr.O was fabulous by the way I did meet with her and she was aces. \nSo I go because my finger was infected for two weeks the nurse practitioner initially was wonderful and I thought omg this is really nice. I had to get these fmla papers signed because my work did not want me in work ( I work with food ) and told me to stay out a few weeks. Well I don't know what happened between the first visit ( which was wonderful and why I gave it 2 stars plus she DID sign my fmla papers and gave me more antibiotics for my finger ) of this I can't complain. But the 2nd visit she was very wary of signing these fmla papers ( and believe me my work makes it sooo easy they knew I've been having a lot of problems ) I didn't want to delude her with all the problems I had been having ok let me get to the issue that upset me to no end - she becomes so visibly upset about these fmla papers that I was also having severe eye problems I tell her my eyes have been hurting and then she goes from being pretty nice to just out and out treating me like I'm some dirt bag trying to get out of work. I've been working full time for over 30 years I work hard and right now I seem to be running into a lot of physical issues I'm almost 50 I mean it's bound to happen. So again she did sign the papers but after running out of the room like she was on fire and telling me \"oh yeah If you're really in pain call me \" yeah ok, \nso my eyes are hurting so bad I call an eye specialist and they tell me I have a problem that's going to need LIFELONG treatment that the front lens of my eyes are actually damaged. The eye doctor said most gps tend not to notice this issue but she could have at said maybe see an eye doctor and not been SO concerned about these fmla papers that she took me out of work for literally 3 days \nIt was just frustrating I felt embarrassed and I have to find a new gp I LOVED this place for many years since 1997 I've been going !!! They helped me through many things and I've always loved the staff there and the surrounding staff seemed ok it's just this one nurse practitioner should realize that some people are hard working people who like myself have developed a lot of physical issues and I'm trying my best to chip away at them one at a time NOT be looked down on.",

The first unit I had was a bit noisy.. these were built fast and there isn't concrete between the floors, so if you're on a lower floor, you might hear your neighbors a bit. It wasn't bad, but once I found the historic lofts above the office and gym, I moved and never looked back. \n\nMost of the people who live here are in their Wo's and 30's, but there's a mix of those of us who are older. The pool is nice and relaxing during the week with a lot of people who work from home, and then it gets a little busier on the weekends with people relaxing and having a good time. We've also got a nice fire pit, gas grills and pet friendly grassy areas. \n\nThe complex was recently purchased by another company, but the new group seems just as friendly and inviting as the previous staff. Activities geared towards residents happen on a regular basis, and the front desk staff has always been as friendly as can be when I've stopped by.",

When we got inside we were immediately seated and were able to identify several menu items that looked really yummy  the prices were all pretty decent (a meal and a mimosa will run you about $20). When the food came out everything tasted great (the fries are AMAZING). And last but certainly not least, our server Dan was super attentive and helpful.

Last week I ordered the same sandwich and it was so good I thought I would get it again. Turkey, Avocado Pesto, bacon. Delicious. Well, they changed the bread. I could barely bite thru it. They did not have any avocados, they cut the turkey in half, hardly any pesto on the bread. I was not happy. I ordered the potato soup as my side and got turkey noodle. The waitress did bring me the correct soup. It was like water with big chucks of potatoes in it. No flavor at all. Now my two other visits I had the cabbage salad with chicken that is so good. I also tried two different breakfasts and they were amazing. I am hoping they are going thru growing pains and will get the bugs out of their systems. This restaurant is close to my house and it has good food, great staff and a beautiful atmosphere. I am so glad they opened up in Garden City and I want them to do well. I had a Christmas Party there for 15 ladies and they reserved tables for me and were very patient and did a great job with our crowd.",

We have always had very exceptional service by Rachel.\n\nThis review is not about Moriarty's but about the extremely rude bartender today named Jennifer. I have never been spoken to in such a rude manner. I sat for lunch and ordered an iced tea (that alone is probably what gave her the attitude). When I politely asked about one of the posted specials, she barked at me that I would have to wait until she could go over all the specials with me. Then muttered under her breath \"like I know them off the top of my head\". Well Jennifer, if you were any kind of a service professional, you would know the two specials off the top of your head. I paid for the iced tea, didn't touch it, and went across the street for lunch.\nI'll definitely go back, just not when this woman is working.",

It is good, but I think it is a bit overrated. I think the soup lacks a bit of flavor by itself. The cheese is pretty good, tough. \nI had the steak au poivre. I asked for it to be medium and they got it perfectly. It comes with spinach. I love spinach so I liked it! I had a side of fries too that were delicious! Very thin and crispy. \nI didn't have dessert, but they make a good cappuccino!",

We started with the Seitan High Fives, which were amazingly delicious & fried to perfection & tossed in our chosen sauce of BBQ. Our party also got the seitan bahn mi, with juicy seitan marinated just right; the tofu rich girl (the orderer of this sandwich wished it had more sauce) and the country style seitan (omg! How do they make that gravy taste just like gravy?!?!) which was fantastically, magically comforting and I want to eat it every day. Our service was great. I really think this is one of the best restaurants - and hooray for vegans; what a welcome and delicious refuge this place is.",

  "text": "Skull's was a suggestion by our tour guide 'Big E' who gave the best nighttime monster truck tour of Nashville, more on that in a different review.\n\nIt has a lot of nostalgia attached so that was the primary reason we wanted to be sure to check it out. But the bride to be also was interested in checking out the burlesque show so it was a win/win for the entire group!\n\nWe were staying right around the corner so we went over to Skulls quite early in the evening and were able to avoid the cover charge which was great (but for $20 cover it is still worth the visit). We had checked for reservations the day before but nothing was available so we had decided to hang out near the bar area. On a whim we asked the hostess if a table was somehow available and there was! They said that as long as we ordered food we could have the table as long as we liked which was amazing. The server was sweet and attentive as was the rest of the staff so it was a great experience. Now for the food rundown:\n\nCrawfish risotto - Yum! well seasoned and perfectly cooked it was a great risotto\nTuna Tar Tar - this came with homemade potato chips and the tuna was great quality\nBeef Carpaccio - Awesome beed carpaccio almost as good as some I've had in Barcelone!\nBoeuf En Croute - this was a bit dry but was tasty, not my favorite\nChef's featured fish (branzino) - one of my favorite branzinos! It came off the bone and was crispy and salty and just so tasty!\n\nNow on to the burlesque show - the girls did a wonderful job and were just so sweet when we met them after. It was a fun and lively atmosphere and a great experience. And out of the 400,000 bands we saw over 2.5 days this was a great, talented group - we even recognized the drummer from a bluegrass band we saw a few hours earlier at Robert's, he cleans up NICE.\n\nOverall for the service and prices Scull's was a wonderful experience and I would make sure to check it out!",

I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I can tell you I was completely disappointed in the atmosphere. There was zero ambience. It was drafty and cold. The lighting was terrible as it was way too bright. There as no background music.  Looking around, I couldn't tell what this place was trying to be. Is it a diner?   For the atmosphere and the quality of the food, it was WAY over priced. Not what I expected at all. \n\nI get that there aren't many quality restaurants in the area, so some folks who don't get to Philly much, might think the food was good. For a gourmet Chef, like Malaby, the food was a disappointment.  There is a need for a really good high-end, hip spot for those of us that appreciate great food AND good atmosphere.  Blueplate had the potential to delivery that vibe, yet failed.  I couldn't wait to leave. Unfortunate.",

  "text": "Just spent thousands of dollars and the last four years of my life at Belmont only to find out they don't give a shit about me or anyone else. The only reason they got one star is because Yelp wouldn't post this review without one.\n\nUpdate (4/25/18): \n\nI was asked to elaborate, so I sent that person the following: \n\nPart of the reason I choose to get my education at Belmont was because upon visiting campus it was advertised as a \"student-centered\" university. This may be true in terms of class sizes and staff to student ratio (13:1)- I can confidently say that I had great relationships with my professors and they were always available and willing help with just about anything. However, Bob Fisher and his administration (whom I call his puppets) just want your money and could care less about you as a student. This became apparent to me as a student leader on campus when anything I did just seemed to be pushed back on by the administration, and unfortunately the advisors of the student organizations I served were to scared to stand up for us. As an example, read this short blog written by the SGA President when we was \"tired\" of not being listened to:\n \nhttp://belmontsga.org/president/2017/2/8/im-tired-of-being-tired\n\nPay attention to the last line in the last paragraph to understand why I said that advisors of student organizations are afraid to stand up for us. \n\nAs for myself, I did not serve on SGA, but I did serve on the Interfraternity Council. About halfway through my term our rules for Rush were dramatically changed and the fraternities were not happy about it. See here: \n\nhttps://www.tennessean.com/story/news/education/2017/05/05/belmont-wants-fraternities-admit-all-eligible-students-they-arent-happy/101306300/\n\nBecause we wanted to exist on campus, we knew we had to comply, but we wanted to have an open dialogue and figure out a system that worked for everyone. Unfortunately, the man who would make the ultimate decision (Bob Fisher) refused to speak with us. He would direct us to lower administration members who didn't have answers because what they were saying \"came from above.\" \n\nOverall, I got a great education from Belmont. I would just love to see some change in leadership so the students are able to exercise their voices. I guess thats just what you get at a private university where your first amendment rights are inapplicable...",

Driving around the city with my eyes peeled for new spots, watching IBJ for the new real estate deals...it's all fascinating. Armed with intel, I ventured out to HoiTEA ToiTEA because I deserved a break that day.\n\nWHAT'S IT LIKE IN THERE?\n-- The first thing you should notice is that this place is clean and refreshing. Simple to navigate, bright, airy, and contemporary. The layout is part retail store/part cafe ala Starbucks. I love the mashup of being able to buy relevant items to the purpose of the storefront I'm in. With a variety of seating areas-and even a private room-your work/chat space should be a part of the conversation just as much as having one. I approve.\n\nWHAT DID I EAT? \n-- Not much, as they're focus is TEA (hence the name), but WOAH. Their chocolate chip cookies are so splendid (TIP: ask for it warmed up). Your taste buds will come running to thank me. They offer lite bites, but their selection of teas and other drinks is fancy, broad, and declicioso!",

  "text": "This review is just for happy hour. EDIT: and lunch! \n\nHappy hour is from 4-7 so if you get out of work early or have the day off definitely arrive early. It's 4:30pm now on a Thursday and there is plenty of room at the bar but I have walked by other times and it was packed.\n\n$3 high life's all day! $4 domestics, $5 wines, $8 citywide.\n\nWe tried the fries, garlic parmesan wings, and sliders. Sliders came with a generous pickle and were delicious. Boyfriend said wings were okay. Fries were amazing with the smoked gouda cheese were so good. Did not try the brussels sprouts because we are doing a bang bang and going to eat more at our next location.\n\nOverall, a solid early happy hour. Would recommend bringing a sweater or two if it's cold out because the windows seem to take all the heat away.\n\nEDIT: Stopped in for lunch on 1/25. I made a reservation on Open Table because it's Restaurant Week and I thought it might be busy (not because they participated, but from overflow). They were not busy at all! We got there right at noon and I think we were the only table. The service was slow, though we did choose a table upstairs completely out of eyesight. I ordered the Quack n Cheese which is one of the best macs I have had in my life (duck, dried cherries, scallions, and mushrooms with big shell pasta). My lunch dates ordered the Beet Sandwich and the Burger sans cheese and they both agreed that their lunches were also amazing. Being upstairs, the temperature was perfect. Definitely will be back for lunch here in the future!",

  "text": "I want to have to come back and update my review, and I'm optimistic that will be the case.\n\nPros:\nAbsolutely gorgeous location. I would host any event in their space and I really look forward to the whole thing being open. \nFriendly. The staff was genuine, happy, and attentive. They clearly want you to be there and want you to have a great experience.\n\nChallenges:\nThe food. I ordered the kafta sandwich, side of fries (didn't realize the side was a la carte), and the clementine ginger soda. The drink was tasty and an ok riff on a NA mule. The sandwich was lacking - somehow greasy and dry at the same time, much smaller than anticipated, and tasted ok at best. I'd expect a lot of flavor and spices and it was really just one note. Fries were fries. I enjoyed the seasoning 9n them but they still felt like freezer bag fries dressed nicely.\nThe price point. I'll pay for good food, service, and ambiance, but I think they overshot reasonable for now. At $12, I expect a whole lot more out of the \"sandwich\" and at least a handful of fries, chips, greens, something on the side. A $30 lunch (after tax/tip) should be much more than the small, order and take a number style that was experienced. Yes, Fishtown is up and coming, but it shouldn't expect to nor try to be Rittenhouse. I can't concede to paying that much of a premium.\n\nSo, as mentioned, I hope to see the food become better and better proportioned, and/or I hope to see the price adjusted for the cafe. I'm pulling for Suraya to thrive once it gets its legs.",

( I was craving it) i was disappointed that the corn I ordered off the cob was canned corn, not a lot of flavor probably due to the fact it can from a can and wasn't roasted. The taco soup was also really good. So if you do get the corn order on the cob to ensure it's really roasted corn. All in all it was pretty good. We will be back for the tacos and try the corn ON the cob next time.",

  "text": "Wow, excellent food and service! I called for delivery, and they were very prompt. Minimum order price is quite low too.\n\nI wasn't sure what size the portions would be and I was hungry, so I overdid it a bit and got three items: falafel, qudsia, and saffron rice. \n\nIt was all delicious. Seriously all of it, and I'm picky about Mediterranean food. There's nothing worse than bland hummus or mealy, reheated falafel. Well, Mona's qudsia--a hybrid of hummus and the fava bean dip, foul--was nothing if not flavorsome, and the falafel was still hot and at the peak of its crispness. The rice was exceptional too--very well spiced, though I couldn't place what was in it beside the obvious saffron.\n\nThe prices were fair: $5 per item, so my total before tax was just $15, and the portions were generous. As it was all mine, I had a difficult time refraining from completely overstuffing myself. If I were to order from them again, which I likely will, I'd omit the rice. Good as it was, the dishes are served with plenty of pita.\n\nYep, definitely a new favorite.",

  "text": "Somehow we ended up going for custard while it was 29°F outside, which is probably not the optimal time to visit an outdoor frozen dessert stand.  But it was worth it to introduce a newbie to Ted Drewes and the world of midwestern custard.\n\nI always try to find out what foods/restaurants are special to locals in an area, and my MO friends swear by Ted Drewes.  So when a new colleague came with us on a business trip and said she didn't know the difference between ice cream and custard... we knew what needed to be done.\n\nThere's something about their custard that is the right combination of rich and creamy and flavorful.  I'm a sucker for a concrete (let's face it, plain custard is pretty boring), and they've got so many flavors to choose from!  It's all vanilla custard, but you barely notice once it's been mixed up with all sorts of toppings.  This time I got the Dutchman, because I love pecans and butterscotch.  It was soooo good, I almost forgot I was freezing (almost).\n\nA few things keep me from giving them the last star.  One: I really wish they also had chocolate.  I'm a chocoholic and some concretes would just be better with chocolate as the base.  Two:  I know the walk-up model is popular and classic, but I'd love more places to keep warm if they're going to serve custard in sub-freezing temps.  Three:  the smallest size concrete is still a lot of custard.  I'm not a cheapskate, I just don't want to eat an entire meal of custard.  Calling a size \"micro\" that's still like 12oz is laughable.  I threw out half of it and would rather have just not wasted that food.  \n\nThe lines move fast, and they've got lots of menus and signs posted so you can think about what you're going to order in advance.  They make everything pretty fast, too.",

They checked up on us, answered questions and refilled drinks quickly. I ordered a flatbread and was pleasantly surprised to get it for a steal at $4. My friend thoroughly enjoyed her meal as well.

  "text": "Amerigo Italian Restaurant in Midtown is a casual dining experience with a comfortable and nice ambiance. They have a few locations in Tennessee and a couple in Mississippi as well although this is the only location I have visited. \n\nI've been here twice and both experiences have been good. Most recently I came here for a work lunch so they put us in a private room since there were so many of us. I'm always sympathetic for servers which have to take care of a large group but I think that our servers did a great job. They were quick to take our drink orders and get us situated. \n\nThrough my workplace they had arranged for each one of us to pick a salad, entree and dessert. I got a Cesar salad, the chicken acuto and the pecan butter crunch cake. I enjoyed everything that I ordered. If I had to pick a favorite it might be the pecan butter crunch cake. If you are going to get a dessert get this one! It is sinfully rich and decadent and almost tastes like a cheesecake. The Cesar salad didn't have an overwhelming amount of dressing like some places do which I was happy about and the croutons were tasty. The chicken acuto was actually a perfect serving of a grilled chicken breast with a side of black bean salsa and spicy olive oil. It's served with a grilled artichoke and green beans. Everything on the plate was delicious and other people at my table who ordered it agreed that it was a great dish. Most other people at my table got the lasagna which seemed to be a crowd pleaser as well. \n\nOverall I enjoy Amerigo and have had good meals and service here. It is a perfect place for us to go for work functions so I always look forward to us coming here.",

  "text": "What to get: charbroiled oysters\nService: 3/5\nAtmosphere: casual, group sit down\nWait: 30 mins (Friday 9PM for 2)\nParking: parking lot\n\nThe Experience: [July 2016]\nIf you're driving through town, Acme serves the basic New Orleans cuisine affair: oysters, gumbo, po-boys, jambalaya, seafood etouffee, etc. I'd describe it as a local 'chain' as it's primarily in New Orleans. It's open later so it's perfect for a late dinner. I had just finished driving 11 hours, so I just wanted an uncomplicated place with little wait.\n\nIt gets pretty busy with groups in Acme, so as a small party of 2, we had to wait awhile. Sometimes you have to nab one of the staff to remind them for anything like water, but you know it's just generally a busy place.\n\nI ordered the infamous charbroiled oysters as a starter. Never had oysters any other way except raw, so this was something new for me. They're heavily seasoned, so if you're scared of the taste of oysters, this will cover it well with the taste of butter and cheese. It's synonymous to having fried fair food, where it tastes so good, but you know it's probably bad for your arteries.\n\nI also ordered the New Orleans Medley: gumbo, jambalaya, red beans and rice, and half of a sausage. It's satisfying and feels like you're fulfilling the pre-requisites of New Orleans food. I'd recommend it if you're new to the cuisine and trying it out. It gives you a small taste of everything, so it's a solid first meal here.",

Upon walking in I felt that even though it's very white and modern from a design perspective, it still felt warm and welcoming. The employees working all had a smile on their faces and were pleasant to interact with. You order at the counter and then choose a seat and they will bring your food / drinks to you. The best part of my meal was definitely the latte. It was delicious and I liked that you could order a 12oz or 16oz. I ordered the Quiche Lorraine for brunch. It is served with a small arugula salad. The quiche is served room temperature, but mine was cold like it had been in a refrigerator. I asked to have it warmed up and it came back at about the same temperature. It was ok, but there is definitely better quiche to be had in StL. The arugula salad was entirely forgettable. I also ordered one biscuit with gravy on the side to try. The biscuit was a lot bigger than I was expecting. Neither the eggs in the quiche or the biscuit were very fluffy - they were both much denser than I would have expected. While I enjoyed my overall experience I felt the food was overpriced.",

  "text": "I ordered a chicken pasta with Bucktown Alfredo and a side of chicken and andouille gumbo. The pasta was terrible, the Alfredo sauce was rancid. The gumbo was a sauce with rice and two pieces of chicken grizzard that was in edible. This order was delivered to me by a food servicer so the fact that it was room temperature was disappointing but it was the least of my worries. THE FOOD ITSELF WAS SPOILED AND OF POOR QUALITY. I spoke with a manager to refund my money by the name of Devin who advised me to call the food delivery company for an order and I told him that I have only refunded food one other time and on that occasion the restaurant called the servicer and I was given a full refund. He scoffed at me and said \"oh you've done this before?\" as if I go around ordering unwanted food. He agreed to call them and I asked that he call me to confirm it was done. After an hour and a half without hearing from him I called back. This time the owner Katherine took my call and had very clearly spoken to Devin and was not interested in helping me. She told me that my issue was with the delivery and they couldn't guarantee the integrity of food deliveries. I told her as I am telling all of you THE FOOD WAS SPOILED not cold from a 15min late pickup. She told me that she would call waiter and \"Get it taken care of\" either tonight (which was unlike because she was too busy and Devin had waited on hold for 30mins with the food delivery service company and hung up) or she would \"get it taken care of tomorrow\", and suggested again that I call the food delivery company. So I did, within 5 mins the food delivery company had taken my call and needed to get Katherine on the line to confirm that a full refund would be give. Katherine told the delivery company that she had not told me she would give me a refund and instead chose to refund half of my order.  I don't know about you but when someone says they are going to \"get it taken care of\" I take that as you are going to make things right and give me a refund. So Katherine was misleading and disingenuous. I will never patron this place again. It has been in business for years but apparently the current ownership and food quality is DEPLORABLE. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy.",

We at no time felt safe because an odd man followed us around the store. Turned out he was homeless and kept asking us for money. I gave him five bucks and wished him a merry Christmas.  Bad idea because now I guess he figured we were suckers and hounded us when we left. A story I will pick up latter.\nIt was busy so can sort of understand why it was so hard to find help to open security cases to get electronics out for purchase.\nThere were so many bags of chips and cans of soda opened and half empty laying around in the isle's.  As Walmart's go, there selection of products was decent but if it wasn't so close to Christmas and it being so close to my home I would never go to and go to either Elkton or Wilmington to there Walmart's instead.\nAnd now leaving. We took our cart after waiting in line for 40 minutes behind a very large woman wearing the tightest spandex and paid. And after showing our receipt to security as we left. The homeless gentleman I had helped out earlier was standing outside waiting to walk us to our car and help us load it up. I told him it was unnecessary and slipped him another two bucks and a merry Christmas. Bad idea number two. Because now we were followed by his apparent henchmen. To shake us down.  I yeld OK enough is enough!!! Back up!!! MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!  It started to get ugly. My girlfriend quickly loaded the car while I held them at bay.  They started to take an aggressive stance so I pulled out my hobo be good stick out of the trunk and said Merry Fucking Christmas assholes!!! And with such a clatter. They took off running with my girlfriend shouting Merry Christmas to all and let's get the fuck out of here!!!!  Were home now and a bit wiser about shopping there. And that is to never return. Be wise and don't go there either!!!",

So no mimosa for me :(\nNot 30 seconds after I sat down, the waitress was asking for my drink order (with suggestions! NICE). I got coffee and she kept it refilled all of the time. Coffee is tasty!\n\nI went a different route and got the veggie breakfast sandwich but I added bacon and got it on a croissant. When I say yummy, I mean it. The avocado, spinach, and tomato gave me a well balanced veggie explosion as my eggs were prepared perfectly and that buttery croissant was *thumbs up*\n\nOf course, we got the Italian biscuits with apple butter and they never disappoint. Soft, sweet, and melt in your mouth biscuits with the slightly tart but sweet apple butter. They are fantastic. \n\nService was great- we were a bigger group and she kept up on our demands and was as nice as can be.\nDecor is cute- like a 50's gas station/restaurant. Just looking for servers on skates!",

I bought only one bag to try it out today.. guess what?? Only one serving, My 5 yrs old and 1yrs old eat the whole thing!! That shows that how much they love it!!!\nVery impressive and definitely would come back regularly!!!",

  "text": "Very nice \"hole in the wall\" type atmosphere that is actually fairly family friendly. The outdoor patio is pretty spectacular on warm days and evenings in the spring, summer, and fall. A good array of games and seating/tables outside are available and a great space to relax.\n\nThe beers they make are the full spectrum of beers from super light and fruity to flavorful and robust. I'm a big fan of their IPA beer called the \"None-the-wiser\". It's a great rich and hoppy flavored beer that's smooth going down. If you're not a fan of the IPA, I'd recommend the Hoo-Brew Honey as an alternative. It's a bit more sweeter but it actually has a higher alcohol content than the \"None-the-wise\".\n\nFood at Blind Owl is great. Simple American a style pub food. Appetizers, flatbread pizzas, salads, burgers, sandwiches, and a few entrees. I definitely recommend you try the chipotle rubbed smoked wings. Good balance of smoke, heat, and flavor while maintaining a crunchy skin as if deep fried and still moist and tender meat. The pulled pork nachos are also a favorite of mine and are great for sharing if you want or as an entree.\n\nOne unique men item at Blind Owl is an array of Mac & Cheese dishes. I haven't had them all but the Cajun and Buffalo mac & cheese I have had and they're great. Creamy, cheesy, and definitely not lacking in the flavor department.\n\nI usually get one of two burgers when I go here. First is the \"Early Riser\" which is a ground beef patty with smoked Gouda cheese, sun dried tomato aioli, and a fried egg with the yolk still somewhat runny (how it's supposed to be cooked). The second burger I enjoy getting is the bison burger. A classic burger but with the unique flavor that bison naturally has compared to beef.\n\nThe side dishes are good...I'm really only had their hand cut fries and the tater tots and they're both cooked to the crispy perfection that I like in my fries or tots. \n\nAll in all, it's a great place to eat, socialize, enjoy a drink and relax...for all ages (obviously not all ages can do everything).",

To many people shy away from putting the sausage in the gravy as it's meant to be! \n\nMy wife ordered the biscuits and sausage gravy. I had crab cakes Benedict. Both were awesome. The food came out fast and was packed with flavor! Great portion sizes for the price. My cousin who brought me here ordered this spicy chicken biscuit that was amazing too. Chicken was juicy and tender and the sauce was so yum. While we were eating 2 different managers made it a point to stop in and introduce themselves and make sure we were happy and food was good! Everyone had a smile on their face which makes it that much better to eat here.

Whatever they were doing, it was such a FUN time! Waitresses walked around with shots that you'd do from their mouth. Shots girls could be aggressive.

I figured I had a low pain threshold but that didn't change the fact that I have a lot of tightness in my shoulders and neck. Whenever I'd ask for lower pressure though, I felt like the massage didn't do anything for me. So, unfortunately, I just thought I was the only person in the world who actually doesn't feel better after a massage!\n\nBut that was before I discovered Spa Terme di Aroma. \n\nI've only been here twice and I don't know what else to tell you except I believe that their massage therapists are exceptionally well trained. They work out the knots without me wanting to wince in pain (and tense up more). I always feel like a burden has been lifted off of my shoulders (literally!). Friendly staff and yummy treats in the lounge too. You feel relaxed the moment you walk in their cozy Old City spa and inhale the delicious aromatherapy scent. So happy I found this place.",

Our waitress was so kind and accommodating to our toddler. Fresh warm chips and salsa we complimentary upon seating. After we devoured it immediately it was a clear decision to get the table-side guac next. With onions, jalapeños, cilantro and probably something else I  can't remember freshly whipped up infront of us... you can bet we devoured that too. Enough for 2 hungry adults, but probably could entertain 3-4 mouths.\n\nThe quesadillas hit the proverbial spot. Pro-tip: you can mix it up with beef/chicken. It was just the right amount of cheese to meat combo. Pair allll of those things with a top shelf marg and your flight will be more enjoyable - guaranteed.",

I got in a race with my server to see if I could make it to the bottom of the glass before he refilled it again and he won. For sure. The buffet is to die for. Fresh seafood!! Bacon, eggs, grits, etc.. Belgian waffles with whiskey butter. So much deliciousness I can't even begin to describe. The restaurant is very nice. I wouldn't recommend for kids. People are paying a lot of money to eat there and don't want children running around and screaming etc.. dress code is semi formal I would say. They offer valet parking also if you so wish. I went there both times for special occasion with my boyfriend. It's not a place I think I would go for just a random brunch because brunch for two will set you back over $100.00. You get an amazing experience for the money though. Beautiful restaurant, top notch service, and lovely water views from inside. Will be back for our next special occasion for sure, but this time I won't be in a mimosa race!",

  "text": "The Catfish St. Peter was amazing! My husband ordered this dish and could not stop talking about it. It was amazing (the little bite he so lovingly shared haha.) Our server Mike was THE BEST! We came for the Reveillon menu and we were not disappointed in the least. Mike gave us his recommendations as we ordered and he did not steer us wrong. Our order was taking a little bit to be prepared so Mike brought us complementary gumbo which was divine. He also made sure we had warm French bread and butter while we waited. I had the chicken espagnole and the chicken just fell off of the bone. It was so good. After dinner my husbands dessert came (part of the Reveillon menu) and he brought me warm brownie pie with a scoop of ice cream since our food took so long. It was completely unexpected and extremely appreciated. He warned us that the pie was rich and that's why we needed the ice cream and he was right. It was rich and delicious. We definitely recommend this restaurant and this place will become one of our regular places to dine when we come to town. Ahhhmazing! Well worth the 30 minute wait outside in the cold on Christmas Eve. Try this place!! You will NOT regret it! \n\nMy husband called every single one of our family members after our meal to tell them about the catfish St. Peter. You HAVE to try it!!\n\n(Also ordered: bread pudding, mashed potatoes, crab cakes. All were delicious.)",

  "text": "As my tip suggests, this place is like nada's younger, rowdy brother. \n\nYou walk in and your eyes are immediately shocked at the vast colors, graffiti-like artwork, pinatas, and more. Most noticeably, the music and the amount of TVs. The music is LOUD (is this a new trend that's going on? I'm not a fan at all....) and there are TVs EVERYWHERE. \n\nI can see this place being perfect for two occasions: \n- big sports games going on and you don't want to stay at home and watch them. The amount of TVs ensure that you're covered, no matter your placement in the restaurant.\n- Tuesdays! Be sure to stop by this joint on Tuesdays if you're in the area. Specially priced margs and tacos. \n\nAny other day of the week: this place seems way too overpriced. There are lots of drink options (not your typical marg on the rocks like many other places), so you can choose a variety of ways to drink tequila. Still, I'm not sure that they're worthy of the price tag. The frozen marg I had felt like I was going to get hungover....simply cause of the amount of sugar that was in it. \n\nI also ordered the chips + guac (which was very good) and the chips and salsa (a-okay). The veggie tacos that we ordered were so oily that the TWO corn wraps were soaked. You had to use a fork to eat them cause they were so oily. This was a massive turn off. \n\nPros: \n- Tuesdays\n- TVs everywhere\n- Great location for walking \n- Fun atmosphere\n- Arcade-like games to play\n- Open till 3am so perfect for late-night munchies after the bars (which honestly feels like the type of crowd that this place is going for)\n- Live DJ at times\n\nCons/things to improve: \n- Tacos are very greasy and oily\n- Food is just a-okay. If you're not here on a Tuesday, I'd suggest going elsewhere as the prices aren't worthy of the taste.\n- Frozen margs are a bit too sugary and the house marg didn't entice me to come back for it again. \n- Music was LOUD when I came here (maybe it's different now or during a different time?)\n- Limited vegetarian taco options. \n\nNice alternative to what was previously here, I might add. But could use some improvements on the taste to get me to come back here as often as I do with other taco places around Indy.",

Of course we ignored it, and then they emailed us, threatened our roommates \"if you don't pay the dog deposit, you will be kicked out\". So we paid for it. And then I decided I'm just never gonna come to this community any more, so I asked my bf to take back the check( at that time I was visiting with my dog but I'll be back in 2 days), and the woman in the office said that \"you either signed the document or you gotta send the dog away RIGHT NOW\". almost forgot to mention that they are so good at asking for money but have not given us the garage keys or the other gym key since my bfs moved in for 1 month:)",

If you visit a weekday AND it's cold and blustery, you will really cut down on the number of people standing in between you and a giant puddle of cheese on a piece of bread (also known as raclette). \n\nWe visited on a Wednesday evening, and we were able to just walk up to any of the food stands. No waiting! We got the bratwurst, but we were a little disappointed because it was smaller than the bratwurst pictures on the Christkindlemarkt website. Where are the big weiners? We came for the big weiners and left disappointed. The bratwurst tasted alright, though, and came with spicy mustard on top, with a side of warm potato salad (which was delicious). We also got an apple cider donut. \n\nThere isn't much to do here besides ice skating. But it's nice to walk around and look at all the German-imported goods for sale.

  "text": "Who goes shopping at a mall a week before Christmas? Me... that's who. I needed to buy a couple of tops and some dress pants for work. My husband suggested we try the mall, since they have Macy's and JcPenney. \nLet me start by saying, while I am a woman, I detest shopping. So Christmas was probably not the ideal time to head that way. However, my husband promised me we would stop at the food court and have a fish sandwich. Who could resist? Not me... I'm a sucker.\nOverall the experience wasn't too horrible, but it was very crowded, and the store workers seemed a little overwhelmed and tired. Made me feel bad for them, but happy that I wasn't one of them. The racks were mostly disorganized from the multitude of holiday shoppers that are too lazy or lost to find the spot they pulled the item from.  The shoppers however should be ashamed of themselves. They walk into you, push you, step in front of you while you are looking at an item, or just plain show their 'behind' to you. Next year, I resolve to stay away from the mall during this time. Except for the fish... that I will come for, but make it \"to go\".",

  "text": "This is a very cool little bar with a great concept in the downtown Indy area. I was in town visiting my brother in law who recently transferred here so wasn't very familiar with the area yet, and we decided to check this place out. The area is a little run down, hopefully being updated soon, and it was hard to tell what kind of place this would be. \n\nAs soon as we walked in, we were very pleasantly surprised! They have a pour your own beer wall, a great cocktail list and awesome staff! \n\nThe beer wall allows you to pour your own and pay by the ounce, which is great for when you are trying out new beers. The staff was wonderful with explaining how it works, and the decor is really cool. It is so much bigger than it looks from the outside! \n\nWe have yet to eat here, but the menu looks great and it is one spot we hit up each time we are in town! \n\nHighly recommended!",

  "text": "I came with my family, a group of 5, close to 5 on a Thursday evening and there was a line forming but it went fast.\n\nMy family and I got all got tenders with two sides, except my dad who ordered a sandwich. We tried the baked beans, southern greens, fries, Mac and cheese. I think the girl misheard my dad and gave him the order of white instead. Didn't matter as it was the same price anyway.\n\nFries were good and I loved the baked beans. I don't know how collared greens actually taste but these tasted better than I thought, though my mom and sister weren't impressed. Mac and cheese had pimento in it. I thought it was light on the pimento and pretty good, my sister said she tasted better.\n\nI thought the chicken was good though not really outstanding. The food took a while to come for some reason...but maybe that's how it is with the tenders since they're more popular to order here.\n\nSweet tea was fantastic! I loved it. My sister got the lemonade which the make themselves. It was also very good!\n\nThe space wasn't that large and the tables seemed kinda close to each other. It seemed like a lot of people get to-go here. It's a long wait though so you've got to be patient.\n\nOtherwise, parking was kinda sucky. Super small lot. Just park somewhere up the street and walk.",

It's the first place I ever floated, and one of my favorites!\n\nI have consistently found their venue to be exceedingly clean, and well stocked with amenities. Their staff are friendly, and the booking process is easy. \n\nI particularly like that they have an open tank option. I find that its larger size and unenclosed format makes the experience less daunting if it's your first time.\n\nI highly recommend this float center to anyone who is looking to relax. If you don't have time to go on vacation this is a great alternative solution - I usually feel the same results as when I've been on vacation for a week! For a busy mom, or a stressed out business person, or a student facing exams, this is a perfect solution.",

Wife got the bean soup and Beet  salad. The soup was ok the beet salad was old tasting. Steak salad was over cooked. Two club sandwiches seemed skimpy. Now my real aggravation. I ordered the meatball parm. It comes out and the meat balls are cold. I send it back. 15 mins later it returns . The bread ciabatta was nice and warm but the meatball still are not! Really! The waiter never returned to ask. So they put the plate in the oven and someone in the kitchen thought that would work? By the way they served me the same fries. This is a $12 sandwich. To the waiters credit he took it off the check. So what! I didn't get lunch. By the way the meatballs were not great. The whole bill was $148 with tip. I may return for half price Pizza at happy hour , otherwise I will not be back.",

Although the inside feels a bit like a cruise ship, it's definitely a comfortable and maaaybe even romantic place to eat. We've found ourselves going fairly regularly. The Gobi Manchurian is a great starter (and somehow better than Woodlands), as is the garlic naan. The service is pretty good and very friendly, they have inexpensive beer, and they apparently have separate kitchens for meat and non-meat dishes. Highly recommended!",

  "text": "We've been to this Ikea store a lot. Sometimes it's for something serious like a sofa, sometimes it's for something for the kids rooms. My most recent trip was to replace the sofa cover I spilled a whole glass of red on, after I was in the doghouse for golfing earlier that same day so a speedy replacement was necessary! \n\nI walked in the exit like usual and went right to the computer kiosk so I could get my slipcover.  Turns out an employee has to set that up. So Matthew took care of me in a flash. I had my sheet for pickup and off I went. While I went to pay my wife went looking for lamp shades. After checkout is when the disappointment kicked in. 57 minutes later I get called for my item to be picked up. As I'm approaching the counter the attendant points to my box behind the wall. I go over to pick it up and hand her my sheet and I get scolded \"get behind the yellow line\" when I turned around there were two ladies that heard her and their eyes were huge in amazement. Since it's been 57 minutes I just wanted to leave. \n\nMy experience with this side of the ikea experience was further eroded when I went to return the lamp shades today. I walked in at 10:55. I was number 69, they were on 56. I made an online purchase at 11:33 and they were on 66. At 11:45 I got called. Why does it take this long for a return, I waited 50 minutes in the middle of a Tuesday for a return.  Get outta here ikea. \n\nIKEAs offer decent stuff at a reasonable price, all of my experiences have been positive when on the sales floor but the return procedure and the pickup area is a disaster and the pickup area need major tending to as they are a horrible last experience at this Ikea.",

  "text": "Absolutely one of the most amazing restaurants I've had the pleasure to dine in. This place is why I truly believe hole-in-a-wall spots are the best places to grab a bite. The restaurant is set up more like a take out than anything else. There are a few tables but mostly Pikpon was designed as a take out joint.\n\nIt was our first time here and I cannot resist but to get way more than we had the stomach for. Our waitress Aiko was very accommodating and extremely knowledgable of the menu. For appetizers, we got; deep fried spare ribs, steamed crab dumplings, larb with ground pork and Thai fish cakes. We also opted for the lunch special which came with a side of salad with thai peanut dressing and tom yum soup, the entree was Basil fried rice with chicken and I later ordered a bowl of stew noodles with beef. \n\nThe salad came first and was easily the best way to start the meal. The salad mix was fresh and the peanut dressing sweet and delicious. It was gone the minute it hit the table. The larb came next and I was completely blown away. I am a huge fan of larb and it is very hard to find a place to make it authentically. Thankfully, Pikpon delivered in a big way. The fact that the chef was generous with the lime leaf in the salad got me extremely happy. The sauce was on point with the right amount of sweet and salty. Also, they didn't name this place Pikpon (pepper) for no reason, the larb had a strong kick to it. \n\nThe basil fried rice had a lot of flavors, the dish was deceptively small looking as I kept eating but couldn't finish. You can taste all the ingredients here, you can tell it was freshly prepped. The fried rice was spicier than we had anticipated. Even though I didn't wanted to bother them since it was our fault for picking the spice level, the chef insisted on remaking our dish for us free of charge. Talk about excellent customer service!\n\nThe spare rib appetizer was crunchy and salty, the steamed crab dumplings were soft and delicate, contrasting the crisp texture of the ribs. I was pleasantly surprised with how flavorful the beef stew noodles was. I was glad they left out pigs's blood from the broth unless requested by more adventurous diner. The authentic version of this is called Boat noodles and they are always served with pig's blood. I was glad to not have it, I don't really like the irony after taste.\n\nWe ended the meal with Thai taro custard and pandan custard served with steamed bread for dipping. I checked in and got a free Thai iced tea, the restaurant also treated us to 2 free thai coffee after dinner. The taro pudding was an instant hit, it was a cross of an egg quiesce and a flan texturally and had chunks of taro throughout. The pandan pudding had a very creamy texture, it was definitely everything I wanted in a custard. The steamed bread soaked up all the custardy goodness. It was the perfect ending to a perfect meal. \n\nAwesome food, amazing service: shout out to Aiko and the talented chef Tommy for an amazing experience. I will be coming back with many many people!!",

But first, let's discuss where and when you can get this unique item.\n\nMiss Saigon is the newest Vietnamese restaurant to open in the city. It's located less than 5 minutes from Whyte Ave. What makes this restaurant stand out from other Vietnamese restaurants would be the clear millennial influence and late night hours. On weekends, they are open till 4 AM. Perfect for the late night owls and partiers, considering their location as well! On weekdays, they are open till 12 AM. Their menu has a variety of traditional Vietnamese dishes (pho, vermicelli bowl, and rice dishes) as well as some Thai influenced dishes and Vietnamese fried rice dishes I haven't seen elsewhere. I love their menus! They were styled like a magazine with the history of pho and Vietnam travel tips in the front, followed by the actual food menu.\n\nThe bubble tea lightbulbs were probably one of my favorite part about this food adventure! They're so cute and they light up at the bottom as well. Perfect IG opportunity hehe. All of their bubble tea are served in these lightbulbs. For bubble tea, there's milk tea ($5.50), fresh fruit ($6.50), and slush ($5.50). I tried the matcha green tea slush and really enjoyed it. Although it was powder based, the taste of matcha was strong yet creamy at the same time. The restaurant actually gave us an avocado fresh fruit smoothie on the house so my friend was able to have a cute lightbulb drink as well!\n\nAlright, now for the main review... the phoritto! I've seen this item on social media before but never thought I'd have the chance to try it in Edmonton. For $12, the phoritto is a decently filling size and is accompanied by a small bowl of meatball soup. The phoritto is stuffed with pho noodles, rare beef, bean sprouts, onions, and cilantro then wrapped in a tortilla wrap. There's hoisin sauce and sriracha sauce drizzled on the phoritto already. If you can't handle spice, like me, I suggest asking them for no sriracha sauce when you order! As I was eating it, I noticed that there was a bit more sauce throughout the phoritto. It did seem a bit dry towards each end, though. I'd say the meat got a bit dry and the tortilla got a bit boring to eat (if that makes sense??). I tried dipping the phoritto into the soup broth to solve the dryness but it didn't really work. My friend figured out another solution after we ate there, which is to take a bite of the phoritto then slurp up some soup broth with it. The phoritto held up pretty well as I ate it and didn't fall apart. It was certainly a different way to eat pho but I enjoyed it! For the soup, I thought it tasted fine but my friend tried it and said it tasted very salty (different taste buds, I guess?). The meatballs in the soup were very soft and tender, though.\n\nMy friend ordered their special beef noodle soup, which comes with slices of rare beef (or steak), brisket, and beef meatballs. There was a good amount of meat in it but the pho noodles were a bit clumpy. It was also lacking the variety of meats that you'd find in Pho Dac Biet at other Vietnamese restaurants such as flank and tendon. He ordered the regular size and said it filled him up. The other sizes offered for pho are large and xlarge. They also offer a \"What the Pho Challenge\" for those who want to challenge their eating abilities, and a $60 pho bowl for sharing amongst friends and family.\n\nSo verdict is: come and try the phoritto and order a cute lightbulb drink as well! Or have some pho when you're not sober on a Saturday night at 3 AM   I can see this place being busy on weekends since there's no other pho restaurant in the city opened past 9 PM I'm pretty sure! Best of luck to Miss Saigon!",

After she paid the bill thankfully she told me and I let her know that I had already paid it. Now they won't give us our money back without getting a statement from our bank and then bringing it to them. Guess they are not up to speed with online banking and email. Also they do not have on records that I paid. Well guess what? My online bank statement has proof. My guess is that they are that lazy, they don't even want to look up the transaction which they were happy to take over the phone with my debit card on 11/22/17. Go somewhere else, trust me they are not trustworthy at all and the headache after the sale/dental work is not worth the hassle here.",

Pool, hot tub (enormous), and cold spring pool all wonderfully relaxing, especially as resort was very empty.  \"Flag\" on lounge chairs to request bar service and food was GENIUS!\n\nRestaurants clean and food generous!  Special kudos to Lindsey in Espazote restaurant who went out of her way to make up for the grumpy customer service of Gino and Maryann.  \n\nFront desk exceptional. Kept having problem with room keys. They finally gave us a free drink in the bar...very kind.\n\nSpa girls super friendly. Massage excellent.   Free bicycle every day....fun, but sore....next time bring padded bike shorts!  Free hour each day at country club driving range....SUPER fun to try, and pros available for about $85/hour for one hour lesson.  Have never laughed so much...especially intimidated when local young girls (probably on golf team) showed up and easily drove for the fences!  Trying it out was definitely a trip highlight.\n\nWill definitely come again with our husbands.",

We watched for our waitress or other staff to grab someone's attention but were sadly unsuccessful. After our meal was cold, a gentleman finally approached to ask us how everything was. We explained our predicament, and without an apology, he righted the lack of salt and pepper and bestowed one napkin upon our group of three.

The service was excellent! \n\nThe only major critique of the food was the amount of grease. The pizza was becoming soggy because of the grease below it, and the Mac and cheese was swimming in it. I saw a previous review about the BBQ coming with \"grocery store bread\" on the side, but I was disappointed not to see that. Good BBQ is meant to be eaten with a solid square piece of white bread. Instead I was served with two small pieces of baguette toasted bread which I could only use with about a quarter of the meat. That being said the flavor of the pizza, pork and Mac and cheese was on point. \n\nI will go back to try more items because it was a comfortable friendly environment with excellent service and great flavored food!",

I waited around for a little, walked up and down an aisle, and still, no one had come to the register. I then went to the bar area in the back, where no more than 8 people were seated around the bar. There was one bartender, with whom I made eye contact as I stood behind a bar stool. She was conversing with a couple about personal matters - this conversation continued, as I stood there, obviously waiting for initial service. The bartender, after making eye contact with me (seeing I was there, clearly), did not take a moment to step away from her personal conversation to see if I needed anything. After standing there, waiting around for more than a minute, I walked out. There was still no one at the front register area, nor did the bartender ever make any effort to serve me. I went to another craft beer store in the area instead, and received excellent and immediate customer service. I would not recommend The Beer Store to others, solely for the fact that I value customer service, and feel that this establishment is severely lacking in that department.",

There could have been less syrup on the peaches as it was a little too much sugar, but the peaches were spiced well. The whipped cream was fresh out of a bucket. They scooped it on to the plate right before serving. It was a busy place, but I still got out in about 30-40 minute (it was just a party of one though). I would recommend it!",

I noticed it was extremely oily that actually defied explanation and then made my stomach hurt. \n\nI don't mind oil either, but something was off, maybe old oil, to much oil, not really sure, but it didn't become apparent until the next day, then I was just grossed out by the experience. \n\nI would try them again, so that's why the 3 stars for now. On the plus side the hot mustard was probably the king of hot mustards, I literally had to be super careful on not getting to much, and I did choke. I would give the hot mustard 5 stars. \n\nValue equation wise, I felt the place was pricey, but if I didn't have the terrible oily experience, I could have seen myself dining again as the flavors were elevated compared to most food in this town.",

It is a great location, right by the river with outdoor patio seating which is awesome exclamation mark inside it's comfortable you can bring your kids and make all the noise you want because it's loud in there. The volume is the biggest drawback. Also absolutely love the dancing servers!! The music is from my generation which is so cool and when they get down they really do it right!\n\nThe prices are competitive, just wish most of the seafood wasn't over cooked every single time I go in there. Everything else on the menu that I've tried is good. Salads are fresh drinks are good lots of options on the menu. Just please stop over cooking the seafood! I know we're inland, but surely someone has to know how to prepare seafood properly. Do that and I'll give you more stars.",

It's nice to have a place with multiple stations to vacuum my car, that contains little stations for single use items within it, like; Armor All, Tire shine, glass cleaning wipes, and different car scent options. After that, I scrub my rims with a special brush at a different station and I like to use their automatic car wash(Supreme) to keep my car looking new. They also have the option to wash your car by hand. When ever someone tells me my car looks nice and clean, I tell them that I went to Earthwash, where it's located, and that I like to go once a week if I can..and that's because I like quality, and those who are close to me know that.

  "text": "I loved the German Christmas market in Chicago and was so excited to hear  Carmel Indiana was going to have one as well. Hubby and I took our two grandkids to have a look.\nThe setting was cute with their wooden chalets for each vendor.\nEach of the little buildings were selling German wares or food. Most all the items were high dollar. Hubby saw a cuckoo clock for several thousand dollars! \nI told the kiddos we would get a hot pretzel and a Christkindle boot mug, but the lines were too long and there were no mugs to be seen.\nWhite Christmas lights adorned the entire area. They had some pretty gas fires along side the ice rink to warm yourself.\nThe ice rink was small but nicely done. It looked like a two hour wait to skate. I don't know, but I'm guessing they limited time and people on the ice.\nWhy three stars you ask, it was cute but, very sterile. It did not seem homey or welcoming at all. Seemed like a Stepford wife atmosphere. Lol!The buildings had an emptiness about them even though each one sold a nice product from Germany. $$$$\nParking wasn't too bad. We got there about an hour after it opened and used the parking garage nearby. \nYes, this is their first year, so hopefully next year will be more inviting.

  "text": "I am not new to sushi restaurants. I have been to many, and have a definite idea of what good sushi is and what bad sushi is. This was BAD sushi. As a USF student, getting 10% off by showing my ID is very exciting. Unfortunately, I would have rather paid more elsewhere and received an edible dinner. \n\nThe first red flag was showing up at \"happy hour\" and there being only one other group inside the restaurant. The menu for happy hour sushi was also more expensive than their regular menu for the same items, which was confusing. Another red flag was that most of the rolls listed were marked with an asterisk as cooked...when there is only a handful of raw sushi options, you know your meal is going to be questionable. \n\nI started with the ginger salad, which was a laughable loose handful of iceberg lettuce, string cut carrots, and a swamping of dressing. I could have poured the leftover, watery dressing into a wine glass. I asked about their special, which I think was called \"Smokey\", because I am a fan of smoked raw salmon...the waiter cringed and recommended I try something else. I should have left after that. \n\nThe smoked salmon was listed as cooked, which also shocked me because anywhere else I go, restaurants cold-smoke their fish. It shouldn't be cooked at all, just flavored with smoke. After inquiring about the Salmon Lover's smoked roll, the waiter said that yes, it's cooked, but it has the texture of raw fish. Sounds fake, but okay...I ordered it, hoping I was misunderstanding him.\n\nThe rolls came out quickly, but the meal itself would have gone quicker had they just thrown it into the trash after making it rather than bring it to my table. The \"smoked\" salmon didn't taste smoky, and they had the texture of raw fish because it WAS raw--and beyond safe food temperatures! it didn't flake like cooked salmon and was slimy. It tasted spoiled. The tempura flakes inside the roll also had a disgusting, bitter taste that overpowered the entire roll. I didn't eat the rest of it, and hoped they'd take it off my bill. It was $12 for that monstrosity, and I was praying that I didn't get food poisoning from the few bites I risked. I told the waiter I didn't like it, and when he returned with my bill, the nasty roll remained but it appeared he had removed the cost of my $2 salad. Yippee.\n\nUltimately, the whole experience was absurd and a waste of time. I was there with two other friends, one of which who also eats raw sushi and didn't enjoy her experience either, and one who exclusively eats cooked rolls. She thought her food was good. \nIf your frame of reference of good sushi is cooked(?) or store-bought, this is your place.\nOtherwise, save your money and avoid food poisoning--STAY AWAY!\nI will never be coming back here.",

  "text": "UPDATED FOR NEW MENU ITEMS I'VE TRIED:\nSince my first visit, Better Byrd has joined my weekly rotation between its other sister restaurants, Fresh kitchen and Ciccios. I have gotten takeout here numerous times and my go to takeout here is the bowls . Of all the bowls (9 dollars), that  I've tried, pesto byrd, Brussels, Bangkok/ thai peanut, the Thai bowl is my absolute favorite.  For my base I get couscous. I have gotten the Bangkok dozens of times now, which has Thai flavors with its peanut sauce, chopped peanuts and pickled carrots. Peanut sauce is so freakin good. I always get an extra one to go with my bowl. Additional sauces and dressings except the peanut sauce  is 25 cent extra.  Was not a fan of their pull roasted chicken so  after my first try Ive always paid an extra 1 dollar to substitute grill chicken .  The pull and roasted chicken  doesn't have much flavor for me.  Doesn't taste seasoned at all, just plain boiled chicken pulled apart is what it taste like. \n\nI've tried The cheesy chik sandwich which comes on artisanal English muffin, whipped goat cheese spread and  pepper-jelly. This  is my favorite sandwich here. I don't need to try the whole menu to tell you this is my favorite chicken sandwich here, simply because I loooove goat cheese and that spread is  like a goat cheese cream cheese. The texture so smooth. The artisanal English muffin is the best English muffin I've ever had. It ain't no ordinary English muffin! You can tell  just looking at it. The inside is thicker than usual English muffin, but so soft and a little buttery. The pepper jelly is perfect zing but not that spicy and just sweet enough.  I was excited to try it and compare to a similar sandwich I had at Maple Street Biscuit Company. I can say this is my favorite of the two. The  goat cheese spread takes it easily. \n\nNot a fan of their Mac and cheese. I would not order it again. The cheese sauce was way to thin and barely coated the macaroni shells. It really looks like a macaroni salad with mayo (just look at the pics), and not a cheese sauce because of how thin sauce was. The jalapeños was lackluster and the side just tasted like meh. The Parmesan truffle fries (5 dollars)  on the other hand is great. The portion size is like a large fry order. They do not skimp on their truffle oil! It can be a bit  excessive  on the bottom, but I don't mind it since it doesn't soak too much into the fries and make them soggy. I like the extra pool on the bottom to slide my fried from the top that don't have enough truffle oil. My boyfriend and I always opt to share them because of  portion and richness of the Parmesan and truffle oil. \n\nMy dad got the wings and he said they were good. I liked that they're flashfried instead of breaded and deepdried. I think this is the best of both, where it's a cross between grilled and fried. There's some char to them as well. I think the wings could stand alone without sauce. My dad wanted spicy wings and the server taking our order at register suggested that Nashville hot was their \"spiciest.\" It was not spicy enough for my dad. \n\nBetterBYrd does not and will not take your order for pick up over the phone! Ive  tried. They explained that the register does not give you the option to leave ticket open and not take payment before closing the order and moving to a new one. You must use their app, which lately has been clitchy. I've only order bowls to go on the app.  Sometimes the bowl doesn't come as described  even when I don't remove ingredients. It specifically states\"select to remove\" and I never click them to  remove, I just substitute grilled chicken. So I try to type in the special instructions,\" make as described\" but only gives you 25 characters, because I also have to specify I want additional sauces on top of what comes standard with the bowl. There's always some confusion and a lot of times I have to check I got the extra sauce. I could go on and on about my mishaps with the app. But overall I don't find it user friendly in getting the item prepared correctly.",

I did like the beer but we now have other craft breweries in the area that are doing a helluva job as well who can match the beer in my very humble opinion.

The kind where you can taste each rice grain. \n\nTuna crudo was clean and tasty and I would definitely order it again when I come back. \n\nI loved my nigiri pieces, cut well and tasted great.  Not sure why they didn't dab a bit of wasabi under the fish but I adjusted my own wasabi so no biggie..  My wife's Sindy roll was very tasty by fell apart way too easily. \n\nVery modern casual ambiance and pleasant staff made for a great overall experience. \n\nLocation is great and I hear parking deal (validation) is coming as parking could be challenging. \n\nNot many places in Philly serving good sushi, this place is and I welcome them.\n\nI wish you guys at the Tuna Bar lots of luck and success and hope you keep the great atmosphere, quality ingredients and quality chefs cutting away for a very long time!

It seems that they need to work on their organization and professionalism. I called the day before and confirmed a reservation with them over the phone. I had to call several times to get someone to pick up the phone and the voicemail it went to said it was full. I thought that was strange but gave them the benefit of the doubt as they could have been busy. We were running a bit late so we rushed to get there on time. The restaurant was empty and not even open. There was a sign on the door saying it was closed for the holidays. This was on a Saturday the 23rd. I had specifically asked if they were open and confirmed the reservation with them. I read Max's review about them screwing up his reservation and thought maybe that was just a one time error. I guess not. I hope they can improve in this area because it seems that people enjoy the food. If walking in, you should be ok. Just be aware if you are making reservations. The good thing that came out of it was that we were able to try another restaurant close by which was very good (Bakersfield Nashville).",

Next to Subway and the bank. You actually can drive through the Habitat parking lot and see the white building. Door is also non descriptive. \nMaybe at best 9 tables and a RAJ will come out. Both Gentlemen  have the first part of their names as Raj. I worked with one of them too, different guy from above. Water comes out in bottles and the Mango Lassie was one of the best I have had but son said I was over the top on that.\nWe ordered samosas for a friend, he left so we did not try. Had chicken Tila and the thaili with the non vegan version. So good and ordered more sodas that did not come out as we were full by that time. \nProbably one of favorite Indian restaurants in town.

There are a few good ones walking around at least they look busy. Oh and the washrooms are dirty too, in fact all the clean supplies are on the ground and easily accessible to kids. Also hubby took kid here twice and had trouble with waiting for food. Cause the staff was asking if they ordered it first instead of checking if it was actually for a customer. They were compensated thankfully. All in all great place for your kids to run off steam, be cautious of other kids cause some parents don't watch theirs, and be wary of the food and cleanliness.

Joe was very pleasant to deal with from the start and was very honest and up front. In a situation where most people would panic and be worried about leaving their car with an auto body that no one recommended them to, I felt completely fine with leaving my car with Joe and his team.\n\nThe initial estimate was 14 days but somehow Joe managed to replace my bumper, grill, hood, radiator and some other parts in a matter of 3 days, all using genuine BMW parts(new).\n\nEverything went smoothly with insurance and I did not have to get involved in anything else along the long. I received prompt updates during the week on how everything was going.\n\nWould highly recommend Orsini's to any of my friends or anyone in Delco that is looking for body work for their cars.\n\nHope I don't need to come back (lol) but if something happens I know who i can go to.",

  "text": "Beautiful restaurant in a great location!  Came in for dinner before heading to a show at The Straz. Best decision I made that day for sure!  I made reservations for an early dinner so I was seated at a comfortable booth. \n\nMenu was steak centric for sure so I went with the Ribeye. I also indulge in calamari, raw oysters and a bottle of Groth Cab. Service was top notch and the experience was first class all the way. \n\nThe ribeye was spot on mid-rare. Calamari was the best I've had in Florida and the oysters (blue points) were as fresh as could be. \n\nAnd you know what else happened?  The GM, AGM and Executive Chef all stopped by the table to ensure everything was perfect. I felt like a Zagat critic!  \n\nNext time I'm in Tampa I'm making Timpano my first stop. \n\nApparently they treat everyone like a big shot there...",

  "text": "My boyfriend and I recently discovered this new restaurant while Yelp-hunting for cheap, filling eats near out apartment. Both of us wanted something warm and satisfying, while I was craving something vegetarian with a brewing Hanger (my boyfriend's greatest fear). Yeeroh was the perfect solution, with the addition perk of finally putting to rest my confusion on how the word \"gyro\" is pronounced!!\n\nThe venue is very hip and clean (exposed brick, twinkle lights, trendy music); there are several tables, but they are obviously catering toward quick meals and takeout. Staff was awesome, very friendly and efficient. Yeeroh's menu offers Classic Sandwiches (set ingredients) as well as build-your-own sandwiches, a variety of starters, and some desserts. Each sandwich comes with a choice of zucchini fries or regular fries - you can choose to have them put into your gyro, or you can opt to have them on the side.\n\nWe decided to start with Feta Fries, which are similar in concept to Mozzarella sticks with a less Instagrammable cheese pull. But the feta flavor with the wonderfully seasoned and crispy coating really hit the spot, and successfully stemmed the Hanger while we waited for our gyros. I ordered a lovely vegetarian gyro on a wheat pita. The warm grilled veggies are well seasoned and paired perfectly with fresh spinach, tomato, and cucumber  that I opted for. The zucchini fries were amazing - thinly sliced, crispy, and indulgent but still \"healthy\" (I.e. guilt-free!). My boyfriend ordered The Diavolo - this monster of a sandwich is perfect for those who are hungry and those who love spice. It's stuffed with chicken, spicy feta sauce, GHOST PEPPER HOT SAUCE, pepperonis, and fries (yes the fries are IN the gyro). My boyfriend loved it, and I definitely had a few bites and many stolen fries. It may be that my boyfriend and I are used to spicy foods and have had our taste buds burned off, but The Diavolo wasn't overwhelmingly spicy. It definitely had a good kick, but anyone who can handle Hot Cheetos would be able to handle The Diavolo.\n\nWe ended our meal with Baklava (because when there is baklava, you can't not order it). It was a tad pricey at $5.50 a piece, but it's a decently large piece. I'm a bit of a baklava snob so I wouldn't say it was anything special, but I definitely enjoyed it.\n\nTo conclude, I must emphasize how generous the portions are, given the price. For less than $10 a person, you will get both quality and quantity. Definitely planning on returning here if I need a quick take-out meal, regardless of whether I'm feeling more of a #cleaneats or a #treatyoself mood!",

I thought the service was great, and the appetizers our waiter recommended were quite tasty.  For my entrée, I ordered the sea bass filet.  It was cool in temperature and kind of soggy and flavorless.  I love great seafood and I know it when I taste it.  This was not.  Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing - but it did not wow me at all.  The atmosphere is very contemporary and a bit stark and cold with it's white walls and lack of pictures or color.  For the prices, I am not sure I would run back to this place.  Just being honest.",

The place was extremely clean. The guy who took my order was probably one of the nicest humans I've ever met. We got two chicken sliders, fries, and 2 donuts. The sliders and fries reminded me of chic fa la, except gourmet. Everything was pretty good. I do wish the food was a tad more flavorful. The donuts were a tad disappointing. They have them out in the open, for lord knows how long. We got the cranberry pomegranate and chocolate glaze. As far as the toppings were concerned they were absolutely to die for. Super fresh and tasty. I haven't tasted chocolate that good in an extremely long time. But the actual donut was cold, dry, and kind of stale. They would have been better if they were warm and fresh. That kind of took me by surprise. They are popular because of their donuts, but because of the way they store them they are stale. Maybe they could see about storing them a different way.",

And the restaurant was almost empty-- less than a dozen customers, so staff should have easily been able to at least take drink orders. This isn't the first time this has happened here. I once visited for lunch with coworkers and we waited so long for our order taker to initially come to the table, that we just had to leave.\n5.

The noodles are steak were fine, but the broth was not. They use too much anise, so there's a heavy black licorice flavor. And they char the white onion before adding it to the soup, which at first intrigued me, but ultimately added a strange burnt flavor.\nI won't be returning.",

  "text": "What an absolutely charming place to stroll. The pathway runs along the water and is filled with wildlife. We had a wonderful time spotting all kinds of local birds. If you can find a hotel along this path, then you will be doubly blessed. There is a Marriott right on the walk.\n\nWhat a gorgeous walk on a chilly Sunday(Dec10).Usually it doesn't get that cold in Tampa. So much to see and it was a beautiful day. They have rental bikes, so if you don't want to walk, you can ride.\n\nI'd recommend it to anyone that wants to spend a few hours - starting mid day and walking along the water, seeing what downtown has to offer, stopping at Columbia Cafe for lunch, at the Sail for a drink, at Curtis Hixon for some people watching, at Ulele for Happy Hour, etc... And then be sure to wonder along the Riverwalk after the sun sets to see the beautiful light show under the bridges. It's really incredible! And if you are tired of walking - hop onto Pirate Water Taxi's and see it all from the waterside!!",

It's always a game for me to decide which workers are on cashiers and who I should walk up to. \n-My order was wrong (had onions when I asked for them off) and the worker got me a new one without apology or anything to make it right (despite the receipt saying I should get a treat for my trouble). \n-Also, someone was vacuuming the floor and got very close to us at our table for an uncomfortable amount of time while we were eating. \n\nI enjoy coming to Bread Co occasionally, but slightly disappointed that this location isn't consistently great service.",

  "text": "Recently went to check this place out,In Style salon. It recently opened a couple of weeks ago and it was awesome! Great staff, some of the nicest people you will ever meet. There were four stylists working there. Anson, Inn, May, and Sandy. All were very warm and super friendly. \n\nThe stylists in this establishment are multi-lingual so you don't have to be afraid of not being able to communicate with your favorite stylist. Inn was my stylist, he is very adept with the scissors but understands limited English. He spoke primarily Chinese, but i had no problems communicating with him because Anson and Sandy both are very good with English and helped to convey my requests for how I wanted my hair styled.\n\nIn addition to English and Chinese, Sandy is also fluent in Vietnamese. It's quite impressive how a person can have such good command of that many languages.\n\nAnother impressive thing is I love how the place is laid out. It was nice and roomy. Not like the other salons in Chinatown where you feel cramped into a small amount of space. \n\nThe design of this store is very sophisticated. The lighting is bright but not overwhelming. Just perfect. There are big mirrors and nice big windows in which we got a lot of passerby stop and stare in intrigue at how nice the place looks. A couple of them even took out their phones to take photos of the place.\n\nThis might be just me, but I believe what really sets them apart, besides their fantastic staff, is the design of the walls. It's really intricate and interesting. Nothing like what I have seen in any other salons in Chinatown. You really have to come in and see for yourself what I'm talking about.\n\nOverall, I had a great experience and will definitely be back. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great place to hair their hair styled.",

Complete with hands-on water activities, a carousel, ever-changing exhibits, a huge dinosaur exhibit, a life-size polar bear, amazing glass art, little dollhouses, and a swirl walkway you follow up to see all the exhibits, you will not be disappointed. The best part of the year is around the holidays when the museum puts up a \"Yuletide Slide\" down their big entrance steps and allow people of all ages to grab a sack and slide down the big (ice-looking) slide. \n\nDon't be fooled by the name though - this place is also a blast for adults. I love how relevant they stay, by hosting adult \"after dark\" events here. Museum by Moonlight is a big one, full of cocktails, food, silent disco, and more. I've heard that the Children's Museum also has a great intern program. \n\nI used to always love the gift store too, as it's filled with hundreds of creative and thoughtful children's toys and gifts.

It is so rare to find a repair person telling you that the item is fine as it is and that I thus don't need to get anything repaired and thus don't need to pay them anything (since they're not doing anything).\n\nRead all these Yelp reviews!!! \n\nThey are correct!

  "text": "My sweetheart made reservations for our anniversary dinner for Wednesday at 8pm. To be extra sure they had our reservation, he called the morning of to confirm our table for 2. We arrived at 7:55pm, and were told that since we were early, we could hang out at the bar. The bar seating was at capacity so we kinda just hung out at the corner of the bar. We were given drink menus to peruse but no one took our order; when two seats opened up, we claimed them quickly. Once we were seated, we were greeted by a bartender--I ordered the French rose, and P ordered a \"New Kid on the Block\". Yall, the tamarind (?) that they burn atop the glass smells HEAVENLY! I need to find the candle version of the drink ASAP! I really enjoyed my wine and the sip I had of the cocktail was very good too -- definitely wasn't too strong of a drink as I had imagined based on description.\n\nWhile we were at the bar, the hostess came by and said the restaurant was experiencing a delay in table turnovers and gave us the option to wait or dine at the bar. We opted to wait and maybe 5 minutes later (at most), our table was ready. None of this dampened our night but I would just recommend being flexible. \n\nAndrew was our server and he was attentive. He introduced himself, but did not give an intro to the restaurant or the menu; of course these intros aren't required but it seemed a little abrupt to go directly to ordering. \n\nWe started with the Crabmeat Pudha. I would not recommend this dish. The gram flour (besan) was overpowering and I tasted almost no crabmeat. \n\nFor our main, we ordered a variety of the roti sathis -- the gobi, saag paneer, tomato mirchi masala, and the raita. You can order these a la carte in addition to the 3/$15 or 6/$25. We also ordered two garlic naan -- hands down, the best naan I have ever eaten! None of the other dishes were truly remarkable on their own, but taken together, it was a great meal. Of note, the tomato mirchi masala is served 'room temp' per the owner; he mentioned this when he came to our table which I believe he does with all of his patrons. Personally, the dish was colder than room temp but still enjoyable. I thought the raita had a nice crunch to it, and with the vegetable additions, had a good consistency to it. \n\nAs you've probably heard/read, this is a Indian fusion restaurant. No typical, heavy Indian food like butter chicken to be found here! I'm interested in knowing if the menu will change from time to time. \n\nNow, on to the ambiance, my favorite. This is a stunning restaurant! From the menu, to the bar set up, to the dark walls, and glass looking into the kitchen, it is a beautiful space. Just FYI -- it is a loud restaurant (but that doesn't ever both us). \n\nReservations are most definitely required given this restaurant's newness and popularity. We previously dined at Saffon on the West Bank, and were greeted by the owner then too which I think adds the perfect personal touch to the culinary experience.\n\nWe skipped on dessert, but P got a masala chai with the 1 oz of cognac addition to finish off -- what a unique option!\n\nAll in all, it was a great night! Certainly will return to try other cocktails and badhi plates.",

Jason was working the desk and he may be the hardest working front clerk with the most positive attitude in the hospitality management industry. He got us checked in, recommended eating establishments and produced menus for us to take to our rooms. There were luggage caddies available, making our unloading so much easier. We called down for additional towels and he brought them up between checking in other guests. \nThe carpets had seen better days, but the room and bedding were clean. The room was quiet and we did not hear any street traffic. In the morning we went down for the complimentary breakfast and had the choice of waffles, French toast, sausage, scrambled eggs, toast, cereals, coffees and juices. \nVERY good value for a family of five.",

  "text": "I first heard the term \"pork belly\" in the 1983 film \"Trading Places\", e.g. breakfast bacon. This pigbit has become trendy in recent years, but a recent visit to Asian fusion restaurant Creazion presented more expressions than I've had in a single meal. Along with many other tasty tidbits.\n\nPork belly pops started us off on a high note, cubes of braised fatty meat on skewers, glazed in maple and ponzu sauce. The sweet was matched with salt and spice, with lightly crisped, tender, succulent meat ($9). Next, orders of calamari--tempura-fried baby squid mantle and tentacle--both tender and crispy, tossed in sweet chili, lemongrass, scallion, and chipotle aioli ($8). Loved 'em.\n\nStir-fried chicken, mushroom, and crispy noodles were served with leaves of iceberg lettuce to make lively chicken lettuce wraps ($6). Flavors of garlic, ginger, soy, and a hint of fish sauce were enhanced by a side of cilantro and scallion. Next, a rice flour and turmeric crepe--banh xeo--stuffed with pork belly, prawn, bean sprout, scallion, with a side of cilantro, basil, and pickled daikon/carrot ($9). Usually a light, savory dish, the crepe itself was sweet and quite oily. A pair of steamed lotus buns stuffed with braised pork belly, cucumber, pickled daikon/carrot, possessed a near perfect contrast of flavors and texture ($7). If you've got room for just one appetizer, don't skip this.\n\nMy sister-in-law's banh mi sandwich of French baguette with BBQ pork, Vietnamese pork sausage--cha lua--cucumber, cilantro, jalapeno, pickled daikon/carrot, and house spread, was just OK ($7). The bread was nicely crusty, but the pork was a bit dry and included more than a few gristly bits. \n\nHer husband's seafood noodle soup--pho do bien--with prawns, calamari, blue crab, veggies, egg noodle, and chicken broth was pretty satisfying ($13). The seafood was tender, the broth hearty, the noodles and veg on par. A kid's order of beef pho with rare steak, flank, brisket, veg, rice noodle, and beef broth was well received and quickly consumed ($9).\n\nMy bowl of tonkatsu ramen with soft pork belly, 7 minute egg, wood ear mushroom, garlic chip, and scallion was close to being great ($12). The broth was rich, the fungi and meat plentiful, but the noodles were in a bit of a knot requiring disassembly. Worth it. The egg yolk was a bit runnier than the jammy consistency I love with proper Japanese ajitsuke tamago, but still yummy. \n\nA pair of poke bowls were ordered by our friend and her son, one salmon, one ahi tuna ($12). The fresh, cubed fish was available on a choice of rice--brown or white--or organic mixed greens. Toppings included crab salad, seaweed salad, edamame, sweet onion, jalapeno, wasabi, chipotle aioli, and ginger ponzu sauce. The fish tasted fresh and the seaweed salad was quite good. Both enjoyed their meal.\n\nA goi ga salad of thin-sliced chicken breast, cabbage, cilantro, basil, pickled daikon/carrot, crushed peanut, and nuoc mam dressing was my wife's selection ($8). The fish sauce dressing was fine, but the chicken was dry and the shredded lettuce quite limp. I think this dish works best when the traditional cabbage is used for more crunch. Orders of lo mein for the niece and nephew were a hit; thin egg noodles loaded with plenty of stir-fried chicken, pork, prawn, broccoli, bok choy, and carrot ($11). The veggies had crunch and the meats were tender. As it should be. Overall, our lunch invited a shot at the dinner menu.",

This next dish they hit it out of the park and should make it permanent on the menu. Pasta cups with red meat gravy aka bolognese sauce. It was so good and had a little spice to it.

The flavors of the curries and other stews are simply delicious; they are doing everything right with what seemed like very authentic tastes and aromas. Now here is my particular issue: this restaurant chooses to curry salmon. It is my fault, really, as I should have asked what fish was to be used in the curry fish dish. Had I known it was salmon I would have passed. Salmon is not a fish for curry, in my opinion.

The service is very good and everyone at the restaurant is very friendly! Their black daal is delicious and biryani is the best! There is no consistency in the taste of food though, sometimes it is delicious and sometimes it is just ok! For instance one day the biryani tasted just amazing and the other day it was just ok...hence reducing one star! Samosa chaat and pav bhaji are very good too!",

Especially when you're an avid yelper, it deals a serious blow to your street food cred. I mean will my friends ever let me recommend a place to eat again!? I'll probably have to grovel and beg my way back into their cold hearts! Lol kidding, I'm thankful to have nice friends, but if any of your friends bully you prob need some new friends!! \n\nAnyways back to the review. SO Dalessandro's, first of all I like this name it's snazzy it's sassy, and it's italian-y. It gave me good vibes, and the 1000 reviews helped to push expectations higher. WELL, I will say Dalessandro's had amazing service, shout-out to the girl behind the counter who wasn't a jerk and treated us like human beings. \n\nThe order: Sharp Provolone, Fried Onions, Cheesesteak. \nThe friend's order: SAME THING but added mushrooms. \n\nThe execution:  A-OK, greasy, HUGE PORTION, decent philly cheesesteak but honestly it didn't do it for anyone, and we still had the itch to move on and find the greatest philly cheesesteak that ever existed...\n\nWill we ever find that?!

Sooo good and it comes with a mango chutney on top, heavenly! Another favorite is the chicken salad croissant sandwich with the best ever tomato basil bisque! \n\nThe bakery next door is also amazing. I usually just get the cupcakes. I'm sure the other stuff is good too but their cupcakes are my fav. But inside the main restaurant they also give free samples of the bakery goods. \n\nI definitely recommend this place for breakfast or lunch.

It sounds totally weird but it's literally the best thing ever. I buy at least four every week we go through so many of them! They are creamy with whole seasonal fruit in the bottom (my favorite is the blackberry). I always ask for the frostiest ones so they will make it home to my freezer before melting. Another unique item I love are the popcorn cookies. They are deliciously crispy and buttery. Today I visited their storefront during the Cherokee Street Cookie Spree.

This is a VERY HONEST review and i neverrr give bad reviews..this is a first for me. \n\nI got the dip nails done here and they turned out terrible from the color not matching what was on the sample to the application. But the worst part is that THEY DONT USE THE VITAMIN BASE which is the whole point of the dip nails. Dip nails or SNS nails is supposed to be healthy for your nails bc it doesn't ruin your nails like acrylic and shellac do and the powder has vitamins that helps your nails grow stronger and healthier. Except this place DOESNT EVEN USE the base which is what has the vitamins in it!!! They don't apply the vitamin base, there should be two different clear polishes for dipping (one for the base that is thicker and then one for the color powder that is thinner) but they just use the thick one so your nails are super thick, and then they don't even and smooth everything out after. ALSO, they ARE NOT supposed to file the top of your nails with the rough, harsh electric filter like they do for acrylic. For the dip nails, you are only supposed to VERY LIGHTLY buff the nails. Your nails should be smooth before they apply anything and smooth when they remove the dip nails. Idk how they remove the dip nail here bc I wasn't even gonna try it here based on how they were done in the first place. \n\nIf you're wondering how I know all of this and how it should be done, it's bc afterwards, I did my research AND got them redone at a place that knew what they were doing and actually answered a ton of questions I had before doing my nails. \n\nI just think it's wrong that people are getting the dip or SNS nails done here thinking that they're getting this healthy, good new nail product/system and they're not. They're not using the most important products (probably bc it's cheaper and faster) and not doing the process correctly. \n\nEveryone was nice, though..I'll give them that much.",

  "text": "Sure, it was my first time at Capitol Cellars. So no, I haven't tried all of their cultivated selection of wines on offer. And I haven't delved into their delectable dinner offerings including prime rib and faux scallops made of trumpet mushrooms. \n\nBut oh, I can speak to their happy hour! \n\n2C wines are bogo between the hours of 4-6, a healthy little window to dip into the restaurant for an early evening treat. Sip on your Sauvignon Blanc or a red blend while you look around. Take in the classy, dark but cozy feel of the place. I was there around Christmas time and they had the joint decked out with lights and a tree. It felt swanky but unpretentious. Just lovely. \n\nI enjoyed my wine but LOVED my small plate. I had the Borah Slider. It was a kobe beef patty with mozzarella and tomato, basil and balsamic reduction. Only a few bites big, but priced right at $5 with a few fries riding along. The meat was superb. My dining companion ordered another and she's not much of a red meat eater. I'd go back in a heartbeat for that kobe. And next time I'll try a full dinner entree. \n\nHead here for a romantic date or a very nice meal for a special occasion. Service was attentive, yet unobtrusive. Highly recommend it!!",

  "text": "YES! YES! YES!   A nice, simple Taqueria.  When I go for my tacos, I want it simple and to the point... the way I always got them as I grew up in L.A.   Some meat, onion, cilantro, chile, and 2 small corn tortillas, served up with an Horchata, period.   \n\nGiven that we are in Tampa, this place came pretty close to nailing it.  The tortillas are a little bigger than \"home\", and they were not double... but the flavor speaks volumes.  It is, without question, the closest I have come to finding the real deal here in Tampa.\n\nNow, if someone knows of a place that meets this criteria, AND hand-makes corn tortillas (not with a press), please let me know!!!!!!  That is the dream!\n\nUntil then, this is my go-to place!\nKudos!",

They claim they can't get people to work certain hours or they don't show up. Wellll... pay more and give benefits, Walmart. \n\nOtherwise, I think the store is excellent. I get MUCH lower prices on brand name groceries and dairy products. The big produce section is terrific. The staff is almost always courteous and helpful - REALLY helpful. I've written to corporate about a few individual store associates who really went out of their way to help me.\n\nI can get my groceries AND other regular stuff in the same place. I save on all those things, too. The rest rooms are (pretty) clean and well maintained. The pharmacy is EXCELLENT! Want reasonably priced prescriptions? Come here!\n\nI do wish more of their products were made in the USA - like the old days of Walmart.\n\nIt's so typical to bash Walmart, but, other than how Walmart compensates the employees*, it's really a great store.\n\n* Many of the staff are retirees, and the system works just fine for them.",

After bringing me the shoes, not once did she ask if they fit, if I needed a different size or if I needed help with anything else. She just stood behind the counter and waited for me to come up to pay for the shoes or I guess walk away if I didn't like them. In all of the Macys I have been in, these people were the worst. The one tall guy just stared at me, never even saying hello. I am not sure if they just act like that because they know they will make the commission regardless because it is a high traffic store or what.",

He purchased a pair of sun glasses that were very unique. Alex was very helpful and the prices were reasonable. He really knows the brands that are sold( material, lens, how it's made , style, etc).\n\nI decided to go for my two year eye exam since I thought the frames offered were very stylish and different. The  ophthalmologist had the best manner I've ever encountered which made having my eye dilated less torturing.\n\nNow, I'm not very decisive  and have a petite face .\nAlex pulled out so many frames with such patience. He was the first person to offer me glasses that fit my face without my eye lashes brushing on the lens (which I thought were normal and no one from my usual eye wear store noted or made such a recommendation ). This was life changing ! I can now blink without my lashes lightly brushing against the lens! He noted the bridge of my nose to help steer me on frames that wouldn't fit correctly on my face.\n\nI then decided to try on sun glasses, again, Alex was so patient ! He took the time and effort to help me decide on a stylish,comfortable, and right size frame for my face!\n\nIf you're looking for new glasses or eye frames -- I would recommend to stop by. This place really pays attention to the profile of your face to help you find your perfect frames !",

I couldn't even eat it. The chef came out and walked around to tables to ask customers about their food they ordered. He came by ours, and I asked about the sausage.  He seemed very proud of his recipe, and not interested in toning it down a bit.  Maybe his sausage sales will explain that it's time to change the recipe.

My son got the soup of the day in one of Don's bread bowls.  I got a caprese sandwich.  Both were just right. I've said this before, but Don's bread is an expression of love! I ordered a brownie with my meal, as did my father from a different server and he was told they were out.  When I went back up to inquire, my server confirmed that they were out.  I asked if they had anything sweet and our server went into the back and materialized with 2 brownies! We were thrilled. It was  a great way to fill our tummies before the show.  I had read that Barrio Sandwiches was initially a pop-up restaurant- hope it becomes a permanent fixture.",

The atmosphere is wonderful, too, with the Palladium overseeing everything. \n\nWe went on a Thursday night and it was actually kind of dead, not very lively. For some reason I expected a little bit more to be happening but it was really just ice skating and booths. I assume it's more lively on the weekends but probably WAY busier. \n\nThe reason I am giving this event 3 stars is because most of the staff we encountered for the ice skating were pretty miserable. I know not everyone has Christmas cheer but eeesh. \n\nAlso 3 stars because my skates smelled horrible, they were extremely uncomfortable, and the staff I encountered to get them were a drain.",

This review which will be posted everywhere is worth the read.\n\nBeing from out of town, decided to google best bbq in Nashville. Edley's popped up with 4.5 stars and 600 reviews. They have earned the reputation of best for a reason! Food is delicious, I recommend the brisket as well as the pulled pork! Melt in your mouth and absolutely delicious!\n\nOn to the integrity and my restored faith in humanity. Jumped back on the road, headed home, about 3 hours later I realized I didn't have my wallet. I called them and the manager Michelle Davis informed me that they did find my wallet. I asked if there was anyway she could have it shipped to me, to keep the cash inside as a thank you gift for going out of her way to help a complete stranger. She said she would be happy to ship it to me, but that she will not accept any payment. I recieved my wallet in the mail today,  with all the cash inside all my cards, licence, insurance, you name it.  Anyone who has lost a purse or wallet knows what a pain in the butt it is to replace everything.... I am so grateful to Michelle. I hope she recieves many blessings from her kindness. Thank you Edley's for hiring such an honest and good hearted person. She truly saved me from many headaches for her kindness.",

  "text": "I ordered from this place through the new app called Slice that allows you to order from local pizza shops. I ordered the largest size they had the xx-lg just because I've never seen the option before. It ended up being around $20 for something that was the diameter of about half a queen size bed! Woof it was massive. I ordered the meat lovers pizza with a pan crust and under special instructions asked for the pizza to be well done (I like my cheese to have some brown spots). It was delicious! And I'll probably have left overs for a week! The toppings were very fresh and they were very generous, each bite I had at least 2-3 toppings. At no point was there ever a bite with just cheese. The dough and crust was pretty good. I ordered the pan so it was pretty thick and pretty doughy. It tasted nothing like the pizza chain dough. It had its own original taste and texture that I personally really enjoyed. The sauce was very good too. Compared to the cheese and toppings it wasn't the star ingredient and I didn't taste much of it but I knew it was there. Next time I might ask for them to add a bit extra. I was initially worried about delivery time as the Slice email said it would take 60mins on a Friday night but they came at 40mins later and their delivery driver was SO NICE! most pizza delivery guys are just not very happy and always seem like it's your fault they're in a bad mood. This guy though was an angel and it made the whole experience a positive one where I felt I should help them out with a positive help review. I also had a canolli and cheesecake slice. I highly recommend the cheese cake slice over the canolli but that may just be personal preference. Give local pizza shops a try, this one at least is really good. I want to order from them again and try their NY style crust.",

Over the last year or so, there have been numerous management changes.  We are aware of the tragic loss of their GM and we were hoping that the increased level of service would continue with the new GM.  that didn't happen.  Last Sunday we showed up around 1pm and they were almost out of bagels.  We placed our order, paid and then waited....and waited.... and waited!  Employees walked by us many times but no one thought it was odd that we were the only ones with no food!  After 30 minutes, my wife went to the counter.  The confused expressions told me that they lost our order.  It was NOT that busy!  10 minutes later, an employee tried handing us a TO GO order as we told her we were leaving after they credited my card.  She handed me cash and I asked her if she even read my receipt.  She stated that she didn't notice!  At that point I asked who the manager was.  She stated that she was in charge of the store at that time.  I DID tell her exactly what I thought of her management skills.  She apologized and apparently thought our irritation was amusing because she kept smirking.  I asked her remove herself and get someone else to get my credit.  The only bright spot - BETH - who knew how to give me a credit with a sincere apology.  Einstein needs to make sure they only put people in positions of authority who can handle it.  We will not go back.  When we did what we were supposed to, which is to pay for food and service, excuses aren't acceptable.  We were approached by another customer and told that the current GM was as useless as the girl who blotched this.  Poor management trickles down!",

They refused to offer me a refund despite the fact that they could easily rent that room or probably even more than what I paid for it. I would not suggest booking this hotel for in advance of your stay date. They have zero flexibility with their cancellation policy. Do not expect reasonable management decisions from this hotel. I promised the manager I was talking to that I would leave a review and they said go for it so here it is. For such an expensive hotel this is the worst customer service I've ever encountered.\n\n*Update\n\nAfter posting this same review on Tripadvisor, the hotel first attempted to have my review removed. When Tripadvisor refused to remove the 100% legitimate review they then posted a response im which they publicly asked me to email them to assist in the matter. I emailed Alfred L Groos, the general manager who responded to me and received ZERO response. This hotel is far overrated because they attempt to have negative reviews removed. \n\nThis hotel caused a tremendous amount of stress for me over Christmas all over the fact that they didnt want to rebook a room 2 weeks before the stay date on NYE. Its downright shameful how this supposedly high end hotel treats people. Their GM who responds to reviews is just a stooge who doesn't actually contact people back. \n\nLook closely at this hotels negative reviews from the past...bed bugs, uncleanliness, construction issues, bad management. Just be careful if you decide to stay here when there are great hotels at much better prices just down the street.",

He helped me pick out the perfect instrument and offered it hold it for me until christmas as well as offered to find a box so I could wrap it. I also asked about flute repairs since mine is in need of some maintenance and he was happy to walk me through the pricing guide of that as well. I was super pleased with the excellent customer service and look forward to working with this company in the future.",

  "text": "Not sure why people give this gas station such high reviews. Yes, it's conveniently located. But it also takes advantage of that location to the tune of about 20 cents per gallon! I guess one man's convenience is another's price gouging. \n\nOh, and they have that new-fangled, annoying TV screen that plays ads and announcements as you pump. Sure, play ads on your own time or play them in the convenience store. But don't force me to watch them. What's more, the ads didn't even really work. One started, but it appeared cut out before it finished and before I could really find out what it was selling. Then another started, and it happened again. Basically, there's some kind of computer glitch. Gosh, if only they put some of the revenue from the inflated gas prices into the advertising system. Yes, it would still be annoying. But at least they'd be peddling with quality production values.\n\nAlso, the station isn't really conveniently placed. You've got to turn off the main road and then make a few more turns, going around and then under the turnoff. No, that's not a big deal; and it might not even be the gas station's fault, strictly speaking. But they still bear responsibility. And you'd think that with all the planning that went into having a service plaza at a location like this, they'd have figured out how to do it right.",

I was disappointed by almost everything (shrimp creole, jambalaya, bread roll, portion size, seafood quality). The crawfish etouffe was okay, but not memorable. It's a bad sign when I have to use the seasonings and hot sauces at the table to give the food enough flavor. The jambalaya was entirely mushy like it was sitting for hours and just got microwaved. The crawfish and shrimp were tiny and the meat disintegrated in my mouth as if the meat was previously frozen and thawed out. I would say the combination plate of crawfish etouffee, jambalaya, and shrimp creole was more than 50% rice...the rice was hiding under the shrimp and crawfish which was pretty disappointing. For an entree that's nearly $20, it was small, mostly filled with rice, and had underwhelming flavor to say the least. I had high hopes because of the long line but I guess it's just not my cup of tea.",

However, the host was very kind and seated us a bit early. \n\nSoon after that, our waiter, Mike came over. Throughout the entire dinner he was very polite, professional and courteous. \n\nMike started off being bringing us a variety of quick starters including an Italian style bread, peppers and eggplant. They were all very fresh and tasty. \n\nAt the same time that the bread and vegetables came out, we ordered our drinks. I got a ginger splash with a Maraschino cherry. \n\nEventually, we ordered our appetizers. I got the calamari and also had a little of the minestrone soup. The calamari was pretty good. It was nicely grilled though it was a little hard. The minestrone soup was nice as well. It had fresh, tasty vegetables. \n\nWe then had our entrees. I got an absolutely excellent ribeye steak! The steak was moist, full of flavor and was tender. It also had a great side of potatoes and some other vegetables. \n\nFinally, it was time for dessert. Mike brought out a giant cart full of fresh desserts including chocolate and vanilla cakes, cannolis and fresh berries. I decided to get the vanilla cake. It came out very fast with a nice side of strawberries and chocolate shavings on the side of the icing. The cake itself was solid, but not spectacular especially compare to other nice restaurants in the area. Looking back on it now, I wish I went with the cannoli. \n\nAlso, many other reviews complain about the price of La Collina. I will say it is expensive, but for the quality of the food, wait staff and ambiance, it is very good. \n\nSpeaking of the ambiance, La Collina is just great. The view of the Schuylkill River is absolutely amazing as well. \n\nAlso, La Collina has complimentary valet, which is great. The valet worker remembered my car perfectly and was very personable. \n\nAltogether, I had a great experience at La Collina. The wait staff, ambiance and food made the experience worthwhile!",

  "text": "This restaurant could've easily gotten 4 or 5 stars from me if the service wasn't so poor. We tried to call to make reservations, but we're denied. So we decided to walk-in anyway. We waited about 10 minutes for a fairly empty restaurant. There just seemed to be a lack of communication between servers. Multiple servers asking us the same thing over and over, but forgetting to bring it out. Our food came out separately almost 10 minutes apart. And we didn't get one of our appetizers until we were ready to leave  (given to to us complimentary for the wait)\n\nThe food....AMAZING!!!! we order the Thai chili wings and mussels for appetizers... did I say amazing??? I wished the wings came in larger order so we could've taken some to go! For the entree we had the curry salmon with white rice. Sooooo good. Not too thick and chalky, but just right with a bit of a kick. We also ordered the shrimp scampi with spinach..eh. it was just ok, but I'd probably try another curry dish instead.\n\nMaybe it was just an off night for service,  but the food made up for it.",

The price for the quality of the room was outrageous.  I would have expected a room like this to be in the $75 - $80 range not $279. I don't mind paying more money for a room but the quality needs to match. Check in was supposed to be at 3:00 and I didn't get into my room until 4:15. They had one employee taking care of both valet and bellhop and he did a terrific job but I felt bad for him.   The room was very dated and the carpet need to be replaced and the layout of the room was horrible.  I will say that the bathroom was nicely done. Lastly I ordered a $9.00 desert that had a $12 surcharge for room service. Never, never again will I stay at a Westin.",

I never got the chance to taste the food, however, because of the slow service.  \n\nWhen we walked in, some people were leaving, saying to us \"Don't bother - we waited 45 minutes for our food and it never came, so we left.\"  I should have listened to them!  We ended up sitting next to another group that seemed upset about their food taking so long.  Another family at a large table seemed to have an incomplete order and hadn't gotten any silverware yet.  \n\nSomeone finally came to take our drink order, so we had a beer while we wondered whether it would be worth waiting for food.  Then the waitress (?) (maybe the hostess?) eventually came by and said \"Is everything going OK?\"  We told her no one had taken our order.  By the time someone came to take our order, we just asked for the check so we could leave.\n\nAdding insult to injury, we couldn't leave because our car was blocked in.  The parking lot is a disaster - they allow double parking, and customers have to go back inside to find out who the f&%* is blocking their car so they can leave this crazy place.  Ugh.

I had ordered Rangoon samosas and spicy Sichuan noodles. The samosa (fried dumplings) were very good to my surprise. It is served over some sweet jelly which at first struck as a bit odd. The flavors very well balanced and I have to say, this was very good. The spicy Sichuan noodles on the other hand were too salty and after a few bites, I couldn't feel my tongue due to the spicy. This doesn't mean that the food was poorly prepared; maybe it wasn't what I expected. This the 4 stars. I would definitely recommend you check it out.\n\nThe interior is decent. It is not a place for groups to go. I liked the small place, cozy eating set-up at the bar. There are a few tables.\n\nThe service was pleasant. They checked on me often and were very polite. Overall, I say exceeds service. The only thing is, I had left my entire entree, it would have been good if they asked \"was everything OK?\" Again, this is a high bar set for expectations. This shouldn't stop you from trying this place out.",

I was told \"no no no\" by the waiter and that \"it was too spicy for me\" and that I should order \"butter chicken.\" I was honestly insulted. My husband is Indian and I've eaten at countless indian restaurants. When the lamb came out, it wasn't too spicy for me, so there's that. We were instructed to order the vegetable korma as well. The vegetables in there didn't seem fresh, as if they were frozen or something of that nature.\n\nI decided to give it another try for the buffet. I found that the buffet was overtly spicy. I was told that it was \"Southern Indian cuisine\" which is spicier. I've travelled allover the world and come from a city that has hundreds of Indian/Pakistani restaurants, I've NEVER eaten at a buffet with so many items that were beyond spicy.\n\nUnfortunately, we won't be back.",

Never the less I purchased a setting from them in an effort to somewhat support local businesses and I got a higher quality certified diamond elsewhere. I returned to look at wedding bands, again their prices were at least double. So I simply made the purchase else where. I returned to see them about soldering them together (the setting I purchased from them and the band I found at a much better price elsewhere). It's then they will inform you that the will only work on items from their store. Meaning if you decide to buy the same band elsewhere they won't solder it for you. Furthermore if you have another professional jeweler solder it the \"Lee Read Diamond Warranty\" will be void and they will no longer honor it. So if you want to pay excessively for buying local and have a company that wants to lock out competitive pricing then Lee Read has your name written all over it.",

  "text": "I'm really torn and have mixed emotions about this place. I really wanted to like it because I loved the look and ambiance of it but had lots of disappointments unfortunately. \n\nI came here with a couple girlfriends because we wanted to come for happy hour. Happy hour here is a joke and the website lied. I'll start with that. Online it says \"select half off appetizers\" when we got there that was not the case. Happy hour is now just half off personal pizzas, which none of us wanted, and $1 off some select beers and wines. If it was straight forward in the first place I wouldn't of  expected something else and this negative would of been avoided. \n\nNow for positives. I loved the look of this place! We had a \"private\" booth that had beaded curtains that came down and a little personal chandelier on our wall with a dimmer switch so we could set it at the lighting that worked for us. Such a smart idea! The booth was truly adorable and would make for a great date night! \n\nOur waitress was also a sweet heart. But now for the food. I was set on ordering appetizers because that's what we came for, so even though they were full price I still got them instead of an entree. Big mistake. I ordered the charbroiled oysters (5 in an order) and the cremini mushrooms with blue cheese fondue. Both sounded amazing but both lacked flavor. The oysters promised rep peppers, bacon and Parm cheese. All I tasted was breadcrumbs and they were very dry, no sauce to them. The fondue was very under seasoned and bland and had very little actual mushrooms. With a name of the starter as \"cremini mushrooms\" I expected a mushroom heavy dish. I actually didn't even eat much of the fondue at all so my waitress took it off the bill which was very nice of here to do.  \n\nI would give 5 stars for our waitress and the ambience of the restaurant but the food just fell flat for me. I may come here again and order something different. My friend had a pasta dish that was actually quite tasty. So this place is worth coming to and checking out but order wisely here!",

  "text": "I have had all positive experiences with two different counselors here. Jill Freeman, has been helping me since July after a traumatic experience. A medical condition prevented me from being able to get there physically so she helped me over phone conferences during those few months. I greatly appreciated her willingness to work with me over the phone despite the fact that it may not be the way she's used to working with people.  \n\nMy son ran into some issues at school being bullied to the point where he chose to say \"just kill me\". I burst into tears while even inquiring about getting an appt with him. Denise the receptionist was so sweet over the phone and told me to just take a deep breath (I was actually driving) so she said she would have Matt call me back (he was in a session) and she took it one step further by texting me his number to make it easier for my to call and leave a voicemail with my info.  He called right back, set something up for the first available time he had.  \n\nMy son also went to speak with another counselor closer to home, but we kept our appt with Matt to see who my son felt most comfortable. Of course Matt won my son over as soon as he mentioned football and used sports analogies so my son could better understand the concepts and strategies Matt was teaching us.  The other counselor we met with just listened and gave his opinions, Matt on the other hand got up, drew out a diagram that we could see and immediately was giving strategies on how to stop, walk away, and other pointers to get him in a more positive direction other than acting on his feelings and saying bad things he doesn't mean and will regret.  \n\nWe will continue sessions with both counselors as needed in the future.  Obviously these other reviews are either old or biased. There's three sides to every story!  I would recommend Matt and Jill to others.",

The soup base was delicious. Great flavor and nice and hot for a cold day! \n\nDelicious Chinese food items available as well. Clams in ginger sauce, mussels in a tomato base (not Chinese but yummy), tempura vegetables (I put this in my Udon), fish, beef sautes.\n\nNeedless to say, I over ate!\n\nTo end the lunch, I had green tea/match soft serve...the best!\n\nIf ever I find myself back in Philly, I'm making my way to Minado!",

And boolgogi was a great sweet/savory dish to help cut back on the kimchi-based stew. We were stuffed and satisfied after this delicious meal!   \n\nThe owner was sweet and delighted to serve us.

On the corner of extremely congested Memorial and Hillsborough, and paired with GameStop, in the smallest plaza ever. If you can squeeze past the drive thru line to enter the parking lot, you'll be lucky to find a spot. Going inside is typically faster but who wants to risk getting trapped? Exiting is tricky because if you park you basically have to exit right onto Memorial. If you drive thru, you can loop around the building again to turn right onto Memorial -or- turn right onto Hillsborough. Very rarely does either option go smoothly. On more than one occasion they were unexpectedly closed for unknown reasons. It's too bad because the staff is super friendly, and do a fine job prepping drinks and breakfast sammiches.

The Panang was good and the fritters were good.\n\nThe soup was very watered down and had very little flavor. The Pad se ew was oily, flavorless and had no spice! I ordered it hot and it was very bland. I called and they offered to credit the Pad se ew.

We were seated fairly quickly by the hostess who apparently was also the only waitress in the restaurant. It took a while before we got some service. My house Cab was surprisingly pretty good. My fiancé got a coke and at $3.25 it better have been the best coke of his life. I don't consider myself cheap but that's a bit steep for a fountain drink. We ordered the calamari as an appraiser and it was really good. It wasn't warm but the flavors were there. Perfectly fried. As an entree my fiancé ordered the drunken noodles and he reports it was OK. Spicy, but no flavor. My stuffed peanut chicken was cooked to helllll. Omg. Dry and tough! The peanut sauce looked incredibly unappetizing however it didn't taste so bad. The side of steamed veggies were seasoned nicely. The waitress was kind enough to offer me another meal and I ordered the chicken pad Thai which was underwhelming. For some reason the dishes we ordered lacked color and appeal. Everything was brown and sad. If I ever come back I'll stick to the appetizers.",

The general manager, Robbie, welcomed us in, which I thought was very thoughtful for a GM to actively be monitoring his restaurant.  That's how a GM  is supposed  to operate, right?  Anyway, we were personally escorted to two bar stool seats by Robbie, and then we met the bartender, who subsequently served us perfect martinis.  This is New Orleans, so the bar was set kind of high for a new restaurant.  It delivered.  Our drinks were spot on, on point.  They had several tempting appetizers on the happy hour.  We will be back for a formal dinner.  A refreshing upset from the typical New Orleans restaurants that ride on a reputation - this place is new, and trying to prove itself.  And it worked 100%.  5/5.  Highly recommend.",

  "text": "DO NOT EXPECT YOUR DEPOSIT BACK NO MATTER HOW IMMACULATE YOU KEEP THE HOME.\nMy family and I lived in a rental property managed by The Nordstrom Group for 5 years. They are great while you are renting with them for the most part but lack compassion and basic human decency, for example while we lived there the home got broken into with the door being kicked down and they took 2 weeks to replace the front door so our family was living in an unsafe environment through that time. If minor issues arise they are quick to get them taken care of as long as you stay on them about it BUT they are awful once it's time to move. \nI was given a 30 day notice that the house would be put up for sale and we had to move. That in it self is frustrating but at the time I had just had twins who were living in the NICU so it couldn't have come at a worse time. They could not have been less empathetic to our situation. So we did what we had to do and scrambled to move out in time. \nWe kept that place in great condition we repainted the house interior every year, and had the carpets professionally cleaned every 6 months or so (and freshly done for the move), we reported every issue we ever had with the house and got things promptly taken care of.  We cleaned the house very well when we moved out with the exception of the oven and a couple of tiny crumbs left in a kitchen drawer and on the floor in front of it because my toddler was eating as I was waiting for Vanessa to arrive for inspection. I figured it wasn't a big deal and they could take it out of our nearly TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR deposit. I was wrong. Vanessa came to inspect and said they would need to have a cleaning service go in and re clean the entire house because of the crumbs left. She was extremely rude and passive aggressive with comments like \"I understand your babies are in the hospital but this place is unacceptable, it truly is filthy your husband should have hired a professional cleaner if you couldn't get it done.\" When it came time for the deposit not only did they refuse to give it back but they tried to charge me $500 more for 2 air filters to be replaced when I just replaced them 3 months prior! So I asked for them to compare the home to when I was given the keys at move in. I wrote down every issue with the home how the walls were filthy, how they left ice in the sink and a full plate of food in the microwave, and crumbs and stains everywhere on the tile  along with tons of pet hair but they refused to do a comparison. Funny thing is in their listing of the home they mentioned how well maintained the home was kept and how move in ready it was using the photos they took during inspection. \nThe Nordstrom Group is not a place I'd recommend to anyone they scam you out of your money for the simple reason that they can get away with it. It's a moral-less company with zero integrity.",
