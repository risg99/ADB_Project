  "text": "Eh, this place is fine\" is the thought that keeps coming up as I figure out how to write this review. In my stable of establishments to patron, this is filed under \"Go to if you're looking to give the impression of a fancy restaurant and food doesn't matter.\n\nNone of the food is bad, per se, but I also cannot think of one dish that has knocked my socks off. The same can be said for the drinks. I ordered a apple cider mule last time I was here and I'm not sure what the problem was, but it wasn't good and that is something that is hard to mess up in my opinion. I also had the filet and the cream of tomato soup. The filet was very tender and good, bit the flavor wasn't great if that makes sense. Finally, the  soup was too thick and salty for my tastes and that is saying a lot considering I love salty food! I hate to give a restaurant an okay review, but okay has just been my opinion of the food here.\n\nPrices seemed decent but close to the more than I would have liked to pay' end considering the service was spotty and the food was mostly average.\n\nOther than that, the ambiance was great for getting dressed up and a romantic dinner. Low lighting, and polite wait staff makes this a great go to for dates if you're trying to impress someone early in your relationship.",

  "text": "I played Yelp Roulette for Castleton.  They were some other options I wanted to try like burgers and BBQ, but I had that recently. #40 on the list was Joella's.  As I looked at the menu, it claimed the winning spot for my supper.\n\nJoella's is a little different from your standard fast food chicken places.  You get to choose your level of spice, more side options, and dipping sauces you do not get from other establishments. \n\nI went with the Jumbo tenders at the Ella's Fav level with red-skin mashed potatoes and green beans.  For checking in to Yelp, I also got a big wing, which I almost had to argue about receiving.  The tenders were big, juicy, and on the spicy side.  The green beans were ok but the mashed potatoes was very creamy and delicious. The wing had good flavor but has the flaws of most wings, not enough meat and some maneuvering.\n\nOne sauce comes with the meal and one sauce is just not good enough for this sauceaholic. So I chose 5 and paid an extra 50 cents for each one.  A description of the sauces I tried are: Jojo (Mustard BBQ), Bama white (a lot of horseradish), cheerwine BBQ (Cheerwine is a chery flavored soda), pimento ranchero (ranch with pimento cheese), and my favorite  - the spiked honey.  I am having a hard time thinking of a sauce similar to it.  Either way, that's the sauce I'm choosing next time then either the Jojo or Pimento Ranchero.\n\nFor dessert, they have pie in a jar.  I had the chocolate peanut butter one which was very fulfilling. I get to keep the jar too.\n\nSweet tea was Indiana level sweet tea which means barely sweet.  But it was fresh-brewed. \n\nI thought of Joella's as a better Southern Pop-eyes.  If you love fried chicken with some heat, come give it a try.",

  "text": "My daughter got a little confused and thought she was buying Imagine Dragon tickets for West Palm Beach but instead she purchased in Tampa. She managed to get us floor so we decided to keep them and take a road trip. Since we had floor and it's first come first serve we came very early to make sure we got to the front of the line. Unfortunately for us we stood in the wrong line for a really long time. By the time we figured out what was going on we were in the back of the line of people heading to the floor. They handed out wrist bands to signify who got to be on the floor. That part was great but better signs marking the respective lines would have been helpful. Security was pretty quick but I never bring anything in with me except one credit card, my phone, and a car key. \n\nOnce inside things worked out better. We managed to find a spot along the rail and began what had to be the hottest night of my life. It was so hot that I felt dizzy at times. They sold expensive but necessary frozen lemonade on the floor which saved me. It was cash only which forced a necessary trip to the expensive cash machine. \n\nThe show was amazing. We were so close to the band and they dropped balloons and shot out confetti several times during the show. This was the most civilized crowd I have ever been in. No one pushed or tried to cut in front of me. We all just danced and had the best time. In Broward it is a fight to keep your spot. I loved the show and it made all of the uncomfortable standing and heat worth it. \n\nAfter the show arena attendants were rude about patrons leaving. I sat down for a minute to catch my breath after standing for four hours in extreme heat and I was screamed at. Since we came early we were in the front of the parking lot. Leaving was another nightmare. No one moved around us for over an hour. We were completely stuck. Parking attendants to direct traffic would have been appreciated. The concert let out at 11 and we didn't get on the road until well after 12 AM. If I came back I would take Brett M.'s advice about parking at the exit and taking a long walk to the entrance in order to be able to leave. \n\nI think how much you enjoy your show at this arena depends on the weather. This arena has covered seating but it is open on the sides with lawn seating. If there is lightening in the area they will stop the show or cut it short. That is what happened to us the night before in Palm Beach. The finale was changed to acoustic because of bad weather as people were forced out of the arena. I am so happy we decided to keep the Tampa tickets where we saw the full ending of the concert. It seems easier to get good tickets here as opposed to more populated Broward County and my daughter lives in Orlando so I may be back.",

  "text": "When my friends and I asked the hostess about the origins of Capdeville, she told us that there are two things that the owners absolutely love: \"Food and Rock n' Roll.\" Now take that idea and roll with it as you peruse the menu of eclectic entrees and appetizers ranging from Fried Red Beans and Rice to Fish Tacos. It proclaims itself to be an interpretation of a British social house that has been Americanized, and I think they have that spot on. The atmosphere gives a since of freedom that allows the patrons to be both elegant and relaxed, whichever one is more their style.\n\nAs far as food goes (and I think the other reviewers will back me up on this one), it is a complete necessity for someone at the table to order the Truffled Mac n' Cheese. Take about melt in your mouth deliciousness right there. It's incredibly rich, but by the time you've finished it, you'll still want more. The burgers are also pretty spectacular. I personally tried the Capdeville Burger, which was everything I wanted and more. The fries were delicious and perfectly seasoned (not too salty like at some places), and the price was absolutely acceptable. \n\nThe only down-side of our trip was a not-exactly-delightful Pimm's Cup. You'd think it would be difficult to mess up a Pimm's Cup (my personal cocktail of choice), but whoever made it did a pretty good job of doing so. It seemed hastily made (perhaps because there was a pretty large crowd at the bar when we ordered) and wasn't worth the $9 they were going to charge. This problem, however, was immediately solved by our waiter who was super cool and took it back. We opted for Abita Strawberry instead, a great combination with the burger and fries. \n\nWhich brings me to my favorite part: the staff. I suppose I'm not very familiar with the staff as a whole, but the waiter and the hostess that helped us were absolutely stellar. The waiter was very helpful and completely cool with us sending back the Pimm's cup (sometimes you get those stuffy types that don't hesitate to let you know how much of an inconvenience it is - not the case here). The hostess (Lauren) was also fantastic. She got us settled as soon as she could, and even paid us a few visits and answered the questions we had about the restaurant and the inspiration for it. And it was thanks to her that we got to have the most delicious dessert ever: King Cake Bread Pudding. I kid you not, friends. This bread pudding was made from a Haydel's King Cake that was brought in earlier that morning, and it was divine. \n\nSo all-in-all, I think it's safe to say that Capdeville will be a place that I will frequent often for their delicious food and even more delicious prices.",

  "text": "I've been coming to this Taco Tote for a few years now, always bringing my kids who love it as much as I do. It's simple counter service tacos with a decent sized salsa/fixings bar and a 144-flavor coke machine at a good price. I tend to go with Chicken Adobodo (which I can never pronounce right and end up saying the \"bodo\" part about three times) while my kids enjoy the various \"fajita\" tacos (chicken or beef). They have limited kids meals (chicken nuggets or a taco) but I've never heard complaints (and often snag and extra nugget to dip in some salsa - part of a standard Dad's right to \"taste test\" the food. You know... for quality).\n\nYou can see the cooks preparing the food behind the cashier - chopping up the fresh meats and cooking them on the grill. It always comes out hot and the tortillas are some of the best I've ever had (you'd think a flour tortilla is a flour tortilla, but they know how to make a *good* tortilla at this place). I like to drizzle some dark, smokey \"salsa\" on my tacos with lettuce, lime juice (from little wedges), and a bit of guacamole salsa. I'll fill a few tubs of various \"hot\" salsas for dipping my chips as well - love to mix and match a few flavors. The beans and rice are pretty standard (part of the 4 stars) - part of a combo - but you can also get the \"pack\" which includes a baked potato instead. It's as delicious as a baked potato can be.\n\nAs for the coke machine - the kids *love* these new touch screen fountain soda machines with upwards of 144 flavors. Grape Mellow Yellow mixed with cherry fanta? You got it. Vanilla Barq's rootbear with a splash of peach coke and some diet lime sprite? Uhm... no. But you can have it if you want it!\n\nOverall, tacos are a solid 5 in my book. The rice and beans are just regular, standard fare - 3 stars. The addition of the kid-favorite soda machine is always a nice bonus - a solid 5 there. Sometimes in the *back* section of the restaurant, in the booths by the windows you will get some annoying flies - definitely a 3 for that, but they stick to that back area, which is hot anyway from the large windows and so best to be avoided. Overall... 4 stars. Tada! I *can* do basic math. And Taco Tote can do good tacos (which is really what this review is about).",

  "text": "Sweet Tomatoes is a craving. It's also my post half marathon meal go to- buffet/all you can eat? Yes please.\n\nI love eating here, even though it's not the best food I've ever had. The salad bar is always clean and fresh. My go-to's-  Chinese chicken won ton salad and the tuna tarragon. On the soup side, there are always the staple chicken noodle chunk and kettle house chili options as well as 1-2 vegetarian options(split pea or lentil seem to be the regulars). There are usually 1-2 others in rotation- French Onion and/or clam chowder. The seasonal soups are always the best in my opinion. The Albondigas Mexican soup is my favorite. The bakery section is the star of this location - offering 3-4 different biscuit/muffins including the seasonal one, dessert cobbler of the season, as well as a focasia, pizza bread, and sourdough/multigrain bread. Let me not forget to mention the frozen yogurt machine and toppings. Dessert sundae is always a must! I usually steer clear of the pastas and mac and cheese. They're bland and overall not so great.\n\nSometimes this location can be a little messy with people slopping soup and random food everywhere, but more times than not, it's clean and there is always someone ready to pick up my empty plates/bowls as soon as I'm done.\n\nSign up for the Club Veg emails and get coupons galore. I never come here without some kind of 20%off or other discount coupon! Makes it much more worth than the $12 dinner price tag.",

  "text": "My husband and I love craft beer, so Philly Beer Week is one of the best times of the year - when we have time to enjoy it. I actually had the weekend off for once, so we made sure to hit up as many of the events and bars as our livers could handle. BRU Craft & Wurst was celebrating their 1st birthday so we hit them up for a late lunch.\n\nThey had a live band performing (mostly covers), and although they were good performers, DEAR LORD was it loud inside! We asked to be seated as far from them as possible, and it was still incredibly difficult to hear one another. A place that primarily shills beer/alcohol should foster conversation, not lonely consumption. We like the concept of the 'self serve' drafts that charge you per ounce, but for this latest visit we stuck with the bar's draft list. They had some sandwich specials as part of their celebration - we shared the roasted pork and garlic pork sausage with sauerkraut, both of which had pickles and chips. The food was great with our cold brews, both meats super juicy and tender and instantly put us in a summer state of mind. If it wasn't for the loud music, we would've hung out longer and had another drink, but our ears were ringing and we left to enjoy the sunshine.",

  "text": "On a quick weekend trip to Nashville, I almost forgot to visit the Country Music Hall of Fame & Museum! I am so glad that I was able to get in a visit before heading to the airport!  \n\nFirst - it is a gorgeous building, outside and inside the lobby.  It's very well designed, with soaring ceilings and windows in the front, and beautiful wood floors.  There is a sweeping staircase and elevators.  The walls are covered with awards and names of musicians.\n\nNo, wait - for real first off - everyone is really friendly here.  The ladies at the ticket counter, the folks at the coat check (complimentary!) and the young man at the beverage kiosk.  All super nice. \n\nThe place is CLEAN.  The floors - whether stone, cement, wood or carpet - all clean.  Walls and windows - clean.  Sparkling.  They are paying attention to this - there was not a speck of litter anywhere.  The cases around the exhibits were crystal clean - and I didn't see people pushing their fingers up against them and getting them all dirty.\n\nThere are plenty of \"hands on\" kinds of exhibits for listening to music and getting information but so much of the visual part of the museum is composed of clothing.  The place is full of headless mannequins wearing the most amazing array of outfits I never did see in my life.  I have to confess - I love the costume exhibits at the local art museums in San Francisco - and this really made the museum compelling for me.  All the outfits are properly fitted on mannequins which stand at the size/height of the original wearer of the item -- so it gives you a sense of how big and tiny some of these folks were (Loretta Lynn was tinytinytiny!).  \n\nThere were so many great artifacts there, in addition to outfits there were instruments, automobiles and many other things.  I would definitely return and would love to attend a special event there.  My mom was very jealous.",

  "text": "Tang Bistro's been on my radar ever since it first opened. A lot of Northern Chinese spots seem to have opened up recently (South Silk Road, Blossom Northern China Cuisine and Chinese Crepe). TB specializes in Xi'an cuisine.\n\nWe came on a Tuesday evening and the place was half full. The inside is quite spacious and even has a patio facing out onto 109 Street (after all, it housed Urban Diner). The menu is beautifully done and more upscale than your normal Northern Chinese spot.\n\n- Liang-pi (cold noodles) ($7.50) - crap, I didn't realize that you had the option of getting this non-spicy, mild, medium or intense! Would love to see how \"intense\" it really gets. The cold noodles had a chewy, slippery bite. Comes with the usual bean sprouts, julienne cucumbers and spongy gluten. Good but I prefer Noodle Feast's version.\n- Cucumber salad with garlic sauce ($6.50) - the cucumbers had a satisfyingly crunchy bite. The vinegar/garlic sauce was bright and refreshing. Would get this again.\n- Spicy pig ears ($9.50) - the spicy pig ears had a tasty chili oil sauce. Great texture but the portion was pretty small for the price. CC thought it came in a \"ear shaped\" bowl.\n- Scramble egg & tomato ($10.50) with hand pulled noodles ($2.00) - the hand pulled noodles had a great chewy toothsome bite to them and the egg & tomato sauce worked well with the noodles. The combo felt like you were eating Italian with an Asian spin to it. The egg reminded me some sort of delicious cheese. I know that sounds weird but it was good.\n\nThe dishes are a bit on the oily side of things but everything was solid. Will be back to try more dishes. 3.5 stars.",

This lovely pastel colored, open air space is exactly what the area needed and where many will, and should be flocking to this summer. \n\nThe tunes were bumping, thanks to a solid dj. The kids were playing in modern formations and on rocking horses.

They included a Tiki bar, Craft Cocktail Concepts by Blume, Urban Village Brewing and more! Think anything from exclusive IPAs on draft to Frose' (frozen rose') and sangria. A lil something for everyone! \n\nAll were enjoying the sunshine and good vibes.\n\nThere's a decent variety of food...Mama Maria's Italian Ice, Urban Empanada Box, Passyunk's own Essen Bakery, Tokai for vegan French Toast and bacon a la cart, Bru, Lil Sum Sum for dim sum and Spread Bagelry. \n\nThere are some shadier areas and pretty textured white umbrellas. There are also really cool modern seating options. \n\nThere are light strands, cut out iron lamp poles and marquee lights on the shops for at night. \n\nThere's also a stage! I can't wait to see who performs! \n\nThere's giant wooden Jenga and a neat viewing platform. \n\nThere's even a toy store with bubbles and chalk to keep your kiddos busy. \n\nIt's definitely a unique space I'm thrilled to see! It's so nice to have a reason to come back to this area again!!\n\nOh, and the friendly looking robot statue named Bebot, who was originally created for Burning Man at the entrance, is so fun! \n\nDog park, large kids' space and nursing areas to come...\n\n*As of Monday June 10th, the parking lot to the left of the entrance will have FREE parking with validation from any of the shops!\n\n**Restroom are air-conditioned trailers in the rear of the park.",

I really love this place from the preshow music that vanishes into the stage to the stary skies that wish me sweet dreams as I leave after the show!\n\nI heard they just went digital and the sound booms and no one has to carry film rolls of Gone with the Wind that weigh over 100 pounds (thanks NPR). \n\nPaid 10 bucks for a Sunday night show. Only one movie to choose from, makes the decision easy. But even considering the higher cost and limited selection, this place is AMAZING!\n\nI really love the architecture and decor. I could come here with no movie playing and just wanted around. It is really old school and really cool. \n\nI did not try the food and the seats could be more comfortable, but this is a unique Nd authentic movie going experience, and I cannot complain about a thing. I plan to go out of my way to come back here. The Tampa Theatre is a true landmark.",

  "text": "Let's face it, Philly is severely lacking in the ramen department.  And by lacking, what I really mean is that it doesn't really exist.\n\nEnter: Nom Nom Ramen.  For ramen lovers out there then, this restaurant should be somewhat of a nice surprise.  Except that it's really not all that.  It's not terrible, but i certainly wouldn't characterize this as good ramen.\n\nThe broth is mediocre and lacks depth of flavor.  The noodles are even worse - it's like they threw in spaghetti noodles and called it ramen.\n\nThe char sui is flavored fine but is a little tough.\n\nSince there's really no other ramen joints, it might satisfy your ramen craving.  But don't expect something you'd get in LA or NYC.",

  "text": "Damn. This place rocked my world. If you know me, you know I'm obsessed with Chinese food. \n\nIt was busy on a Saturday night, but we only waited 15 minutes for a table for 4. The table ordered: mala chicken, moo shu pork, shrimp with snow peas and mushrooms, and hunan tofu. I only tried the chicken and pork, but both of the other dishes looked amazing, got rave reviews, and the plates were all clean by the end. I could see that the shrimp was cooked to absolute perfection.\n\nNext time I go back (oh, there WILL BE a next time, for sure) it will be really hard not to get the mala chicken again. Menu listed it as very spicy, and while it had a kick it definitely wasn't Han Dynasty spicy. The morsels of chicken were so tender and fried beautifully - there was a very light coating that provided just enough crispness. The sauce was surprisingly complex, with notes of sichuan peppercorn, black vinegar, honey, garlic, and chiles. The portion was quite large but I ended up eating it all. Well, F kept stealing pieces but I guess I did offer to share both dishes we ordered... Next time he's getting his own.\n\nThe moo shu pork was OK, but moo shu isn't really my thing. I will say it's by far the best moo shu I've had on a very short list. Loved the seaweed (?) and glass noodles; it was very fresh-tasting.\n\nHousemade pickles to start and chocolate-dipped fortune cookies with orange wedges at the end. What could be better? Some reviewers have complained about the portion sizes but I thought they were a reasonable size. You're not getting two pounds of food like at a cheap Chinese takeout joint, but the food is infinitely better, fresher, and made with higher quality ingredients. Worth paying a few extra dollars for.\n\nDinner entrees are a bit pricey for typical Chinese food, but on par with what you might see at the local Thai places ($14-$17 per entree). Certainly still affordable by Main Line standards!",

The menu is a little disorienting at first but it breaks down into plain meat tacos, meat and cheese quesadilla, and tamales. The meat was wonderful. The steak was super tender and flavorful. The pork was a little fatty, bit worth I for the flavor. My favorite was the melted cheese. It was more sharp than a traditional queso fresco, an really made them stand out above the plain tacos. There are definitely no frills at this place. Old school, but being done right.",

He worked with me during my confirmation and also with all of the steps I needed to take before getting married. He is extremely kind, caring, and he made the process fun!

  "text": "Due to my extensive travel history, I have built a very strong and picky tongue for authenticity. That being said, I can tell you Casablanca is the real damn deal. I'm about to tell you why. \n\nThe entire menu at Casablanca is filled with what you'd find at a typical restaurant in Havana. I recognized many dishes that I've dined on and they were all delicious, so it was hard for me to make a decision. During my first visit I bellied up to the world-famous Sandwich Cubano (roasted pork, ham, pickles, Swiss cheese and mustard on a Cuban style bread). Man, I tell you, it was SPOT ON. Reminded me of my trip years ago when I had my first one. The meat was roasted to perfection, delivered a dynamite of flavor and was too damn good to stop eating! If you try one thing here, this is it!\n\nOn another occasion I was served the Ropa Vieja (shredded beef in Cuban Creole sauce with onions and peppers. Served with white rice, black beans and sweet ripe plantains (maduros)). This also happens to be Cuba's national dish! Again, each bite took me back to Havana. Sweet, delicate and tender beef paired with fresh cooked rice and beans. The taste was outstanding. Boise lacks so many authentic cuisine but Casablanca reminds me that true food is there if you seek it. \n\nOn another note, I absolutely loved our waiter both times. He was very kindhearted and humorous, took time to inform us of what each dish consisted of, which was super helpful for my very Americanized husband (nothing wrong with that - he just doesn't have the palate for authentic food like I do!). \n\nIn a heartbeat, I recommend this to anyone who is tired of over-sweetened, sodium packed eateries that boast but fail to deliver genuine cuisine. Also, if you've never had Cuban food you are missing out on so much!!! And it's here, in little Boise so HEAD OVER AND SUPPORT THIS LOCAL BUSINESS that I love so dearly!",

Dumplings are only sold in groups of 5 unless you head over on Wednesday when they have $1 dumplings. Typically you can not mix Sweet and savory but the counter guy was feeling friendly and allowed me to do so. My friend and I ordered a cheesesteak noodles and a 5 pack of dumplings. Taco, buffalo chicken, cheesesteak, apple pie and cheesecake. There are sauces on the table are great for dipping. As a condiment lover, enjoyed them greatly! The dumplings were packed with flavor. The cheesesteak was my favorite savory And the cheesecake my favorite sweet. Apparently cheese is the key to my happiness! I might have ordered another if they available individually.\n\nThe noodles were fresh. Ramen style but fancier. They were tossed in a white super gooey delicious cheese sauce with large pieces of cheesesteak and perfectly cut scallions. \n\nLooking forward to hearing back to try some more.

Not that coffee shops don't smell okay, the slight hint of tea leaves in the air is so refreshing here.\n\nThey still have everything I love from the other Mojos including the nifty chalkboard, local art, but more of it, including the postcards and flyers lining a step right under the bar. I called for a Milky Way and forgot to request it cold. Nonetheless, it was DELICIOUS and beautiful to boot. \n\nThough there are no couches for that homey sort of feel, I love all the tables because 1. They're big enough for all my shenanigans I bring to the coffee shop. \n2. There is no lack of plugs. \n3. They're spread out enough that everyone's biz is their own.\n4. This is a weird one. I love seeing people I know, but sometimes it can be distracting when trying to knock something out. There are enough tables that you don't have to be by the front door where you'd constantly be looking up when someone comes in and possibly seeing someone you know with the obligation to chat. And there is a back door that you can escape out of. \n\nMy only problem is the chairs are a little tough on my boney butt, but I think that's a personal problem. Next time I'll just bring one of those blow up cushions, and be the cool kid. Will definitely be returning!!!",

I love Joe and Maurice (2 workers, one is now a manager). The workers do their job and do them well. I haven't had serious issues with projection or sound (not that I can remember). The theater layout is strange and the floor in the lobby I have heard is uneven and makes you feel like you have vertigo.\n\nThe number one issue with this theater is how small the ladies room is. I haven't been into the men's room. The ladies room is really tight but I've heard rumors about expansion. I have never worked their concession but it's pretty small back there. I sucked at the cafe but as a customer, I've had no complaints. Oh, and in one of the theaters is a closet and at one point someone went in there which disturbed my movie watching experience (note: She doesn't work there anymore). This is rare that it happens, though. Also, I think the ushers do a good job of theater checks and cleaning up. Very consistent.\n\nAs for parking, go to the Olde City Garage, entrance on 2nd. Show your ticket to the person at the door or box office at the Ritz Five and they will give you a validation card. You now pay $6.50 for parking! Easy and convenient. Too bad they raised the rates, it used to be only $5 for parking.\n\nOverall, a great theater. I love the Ritz movie theaters.",

First reason might be because the pizza crust here might be the best: so insanely flavorful, with a perfect leopard-spotted undercarriage indicating expertly tended char, plus the right amount of cornicicione. Secondly, the menu offers diners both the complex AND simple pizza options, and there is no 'bad' choice. The balance of flavors--in the simple Margarita or the epically delicious Tartufo--is always on point. \n\nIt seemed appropriate, then, to celebrate true love over a love of pizza. For our rehearsal dinner, Starr Catering (the BEST!) helped us come up with a delightful menu that made all our guests happy in this fun event space. The antipasti course was loaded with so many options, and served family style, that everyone nearly forgot to save room for the main attraction-the pizza, obviously! We went with the margarita for those who like to keep is simple, the spinach because it's amazing, and the tartufo for those willing to be adventurous. Lastly, our servers began bringing out all the flavors of gelato for everyone to sample. In short, nobody left hungry or thirsty and plenty of pizza was packed up to go back with the boys to enjoy later!",

So, since we already paid for an hour of parking, we decided to try another restaurant close by. We found Baileys Range and decided to give it a shot!\n\nThe atmosphere is hipster/casual.

Awesome idea, but we opted for a table upstairs for 2. \n\nWe were seated and a waitress brought us a couple pitchers of water right away. We looked over the menu and I was impressed by the amount of variety in the burgers. I also loved the idea of the burger battle. Basically every week 2 burgers battle and whichever one has the most ratings stays for another week. Very cool. I ordered the California Bison Burger and fries with the house ketchup and house cheddar cheese sauce. \n\nThe burger was incredible. Very juicy and just the right amount of gamey taste. The cole slaw was perfect on top as was the pork shoulder. The beer bun was delicious! The fries were crispy and seasoned which was great. The cheddar sauce was very good. The house ketchup was unique. It was very cinnamonny (Yes I made that word up). \n\nThe water was room temperature which was strange and the waitress wasn't overly friendly or personable. She was just kind of there to do her job, which was fine. Also, for $12 I expected the burger to be a little bigger. But it was cooked perfectly so there's not much to complain about. \n\nOverall this place is awesome! Definitely worth the stop in and we will be back for sure.

  "text": "Last time trying Kaiseki was in Kyoto Japan and I enjoyed it tremendously. I was glad to find out that Yoichi's offers Kaiseki and I don't have to fly across the Pacific. As a fan of authentic Japanese traditional cuisine, I could not pass up on this opportunity. It was a great find during my visit in the lovely city of Santa Barbara.\n\nThere is definitely a difference when using all five senses of touch, smell, taste, sight, and hearing. The presentation and simplicity says plenty. The main ingredient of each dish were never overpowered but accentuated. Each course is presented with an introduction. \n\nThe staff is friendly just like the service you get in Japan. The experience was unforgettable. Thank you Yoichi's!",

Musty was the least of the problems. Filthy was the BIGGEST ISSUE. Dry food on the carpet, filthy carpet, filthy bed platform and blood stains on the white bed comforter.  Rusted bathtub fixtures, moldy wall paper, smelly room... GROSS, and the worst HGI I've stayed at - and I love.

I had the french toast and my husband had a traditional eggs/bacon breakfast.  The french toast is made with banana bread, which gave it an interesting flavor.  I love french toast and eat it everywhere I go just to compare.  I can't say this was my absolute favorite, but it also wasn't boring.  I'd eat it again for sure!   Just to have something different.\n\nTheir fruit cup was fabulous - really fresh fruit! \n\nThe eggs and bacon were also delightful.  My husband said it was some of the best bacon he has ever had!   \n\nAnd the service was stellar!   I highly recommend.",

Mr Beffrey enjoyed his Women In Love, which had a grassy, herbal note with celery juice and basil. Interesting touch of cracked pepper on top.\n\nMs Beffrey really appreciated the separate Mocktails section, and the Spicy Pineapple was delicious. Couldn't actually taste any of the cayenne pepper (so maybe more appropriately label it just \"Pineapple\"?), but that didn't detract from the drink at all.\n\nWe will certainly be coming back to eat -- our eyes are on the Cucumber Gazpacho and the Bao Buns!",

My go tos are the fish (fried), shrimp (grilled) and carnitas (there's black beans on it, SOLD!) \nDiscovered this little gem on a trip to the new target in the area and because I love tacos decided to make a trip in. \nIt's got beach, sunshine, and corona with a lime vibes that come at a decent price, depending on what you choose. I usually round out around $12. Presentation is great whether you dine in or take out. \nThis maybe a weird note, but the water from pop machine is CRISP and delicious and they have some specialty brand of pops. \nI give this place two thumbs up in a Philly sea of just okay taco joints! Not super authentic but the flavor is there. And that definitely counts. If you're close to Fairmount/Spring Garden drop in!",

  "text": "Nutts has such awesome things on their menu that I want to try it all! I mean a crab omelet, a chorizo omelet, famous fried chicken, fried pickles, buffalo pizza, Mexican pizza.....the description on all these items make them sound great. \n\nI've been her twice and was really not impressed with breakfast....I will continue to come and find what I love though, because lunch seems more like appealing to me. My hubby-to-be loves the pancakes and omelets though (especially the chorizo one).\n\nMy recommendation if you love spicy food:\n\nBuffalo chicken pizza. SUPER spicy food that is....the buffalo chicken pizza will make a grown man cry. I normally like spicy food, and buffalo sauce is one of those things that varies so much in heat depending on the place. Well, this place definitely PACKS the heat! It came out of the kitchen bubbling with red sauce and I needed a milkshake to get past the first slice. \n\nIf you are sharing an appetizer: \n\nBaked Junkyard fries - gross name, but sooo good! They have cheese, chorizo, melted cheese, sour cream and all sorts of amazingness! I think if I ever end up pregnant, this is what my fetus and I would constantly crave. \n\nI would skip:\nDenver scramble. which sounds delicious with Sauteed Potatoes, Mushrooms, Onions and Peppers, Topped with Cheddar Cheese and 2 Scrambled Eggs...but it's not. The potatoes were not seasoned with any pepper or salt, and everything is just thrown together like a bad batch of hash browns. Also, it's a small portion compared to the other breakfast platters, so plan accordingly. \n\nI will definitely be returning to try their famous chicken, and the service is always friendly and just overall there is something very inviting about the place...especially their outside area in a cool summer day.",

He asked what I wanted my hair to look like, and started mixing color and telling me what conditioning treatment I would need. \n\nHe settled on a double process with a conditioning treatment. He was so excited the whole time. \"Your hair is going to be bananas!\"\n\nAs a stylist, Anthony really takes a good deal of pride in his work. While working on me he still had time to run around and assist some of the younger stylists with their clients. He seriously seems to love his job.\n\nMariposa has a cool monitor in front of the mirror streaming popular Tweets and celebrity news and trivia (sort of like the monitors in taxis). The monitors also had a system where you entered all of your personal info about your hair. Curly/straight/colored/conditioned/products used, etc. This then allows the system to match you with the ideal product that you should use on your hair. Pretty cool.\n\nAnthony was so fun and my time in the chair flew by. By the time he was finished I had a whole new look and all of the other stylists were complimenting him on his work.\n\nDefinitely will be going back soon!",

Not the most tender, but still easy to get off the bone\n- Sandwiches: We got the pulled pork, prime rib and beef brisket; the best one was the brisket by far. The other two were about tied, hah.\n- Beans: I love their beans!! Not too sweet, not too heavy. yUmms\n- Pork skin: we got it because we wanted to try it. Verdict? We don't like pork skins. But you could tell they were fresh (came hot) and it was really good-looking... we just don't like pork skins, hah\n- Slaw: really good too, went well with my meat!\n- Sauces: I think there were about 3. My favorite was the sweet but that's because I love sweet things, hehe. The table's least favorite was the one with the V on it.\n\nI also want to point out that they pack up take-out REALLY well!! Everything was nicely packaged and separate and was very easy to just unwrap the goodness (I felt like a kid on Christmas day) and feast! Also, it only took TWENTY minutes!!!\n\nOverall: BBQ is BBQ, but Bogart's does a darn good job. Save the line-standing at Pappy's and just come here :) Oh and get beer at iTap while you're at it ;)",

  "text": "This was our home away from home for the Christmas holiday, and we enjoyed our stay immensely. We paid extra for the deluxe king room, so there was room for more than just a bed, and we didn't feel crowded. Plus - bonus - our room actually had a view of the Mississippi River, and it was strangely addicting to just stand there and watch the barges and tugs go by. I also loved that there was a Keurig coffee maker in the room.\n\nThe hotel was beautifully decorated for the Christmas holiday, so there were always people hanging out in the lobby and bar just enjoying the scenery or taking pictures. This is a crowded time of year for New Orleans, and the Carousel Bar in the hotel was always packed, but fortunately we were able to belly up to the bar next to the hotel restaurant, and sample their specialty holiday cocktails.  We had Christmas lunch at Criollo Restaurant in the hotel, and it was surprisingly good-with the desserts being exceptional.\n\nI do NOT think the staff is as professional as it is at other NOLA hotels we've stayed at: friends we were traveling with had constant issues with the staff and a scooter they rented, plus the doormen seemed to be more interested in chatting with each other than opening doors, saying hello, etc. Also, I think noise is a problem in all of these old hotels, and this one is no exception.  However, since we travel with a small speaker so we can sleep with white noise, this wasn't really an issue for us.\n\nThe location of the hotel is hard to beat, the elevators were surprisingly fast, and as a whole, we had a very good time here.",

Each of their twenty-something ice cream flavors is \"handmade\" (although I'm not...quite sure what that means), and their frozen cappuccino is freshly composed each day, in house.  Pastries and touristy-treats are also available, although those are provided by outside vendors.  Service does take a little while, since each drink is made to order-- I guess you could say, \"with love.\"  The ice cream is worth the wait, though!\n\nPerhaps Mike knew that I was a tourist, or, perhaps I am just that cute *wink*, because I was served a scoop of Tennessee Fudge so generous that Texas would be jealous!  It was smooth and creamy, but not gluey, like some other gourmet ice creams can be.   I also sampled the Pistachio, Red Velvet, and Moose Tracks, which were also delicious.  \n\nYes, it was still so early in the morning that people were just barely arriving at work.  Didn't matter.

  "text": "These guys are pretty new, but already I am seriously loving this place.  It is a real gem of a coffee shop, and has serious charm, not to mention dynamite beverages.\n\nThey have an entrance through their building on Arlington, but the main cafe is actually located on Roff Way, which is almost more of a back alley, to be honest.  Now, when I say they are located in a tiny storefront, I mean just that.  Like, my office is bigger than their whole shop.  Walk right in, there is the counter on one side, a few stools along the street-side window, and some nice, simple decorations on the wall.  Simple, compact, and no-nonsense.\n\nThey roast their own beans, which come in several varieties in many levels of darkness, caffeine, and flavor profiles.  What really impresses me is that they individually grind the beans for YOUR own beverage, and then do a pour-over method with a neat contraption built into the counter.  I was also impressed with how quickly they have this down, as until now I've been accustomed to pour-over taking quite a bit longer to get a cup o' joe.  Most of their menu is standard coffee, intended to show off the different characters of the beans.  However, you will also find a scant few mixed cafe drinks as well.  I tried the Bullet Proof, which I found phenomenal!  In addition to very nice coffee, it includes ghee, MCT oil, and brown sugar, all frothed in a blender to give a very rich, not overly sweet, and amazingly energizing brew.  Very unique and inventive concoction, to be sure.\n\nTo round things out, there are a few bottles of iced teas and mineral water available, but also be aware that it does not appear as if they serve any food or snacks here.  You can also buy bags of their coffee, whole bean or ground, and enjoy their product at home.  Price-wise you are looking at maybe $5 or so for the mixed drinks, and a buck or two less for regular coffee.  So a bit pricey for individual cups, but you get amazing quality.\n\nService here was exceptionally friendly and helpful, and as stated above, very prompt in how they make this style of coffee.  They are pretty easy to find, even for how they are sort of tucked out of the way.  There is plenty of street parking in the surrounding neighborhoods, and you could easily walk over from anywhere in the Riverwalk district.  And outside, they have a really lovely seating area that I look forward to enjoying during the warmer months.\n\nAll in all, Reno Coffee Company is a sort of place I wish more coffee shops were like.  They have their craft down, and want nothing to detract from that.  I think this chic, tiny space is really cool, and will certainly be stopping by again whenever I'm down by the river.  Cheers!",

  "text": "We had tried another of the coffee places in Santa Barbara the day before and it wasn't bad. But husband wanted to try the other place on my list (Handlebar - because yes, I made a list of coffee places ahead of time. We live in Seattle, after all, coffee is kind of a thing) we decided to try it and wound up liking Handlebar SO much more. \n\nConfession: When I first saw the name \"handlebar\" weeks before our trip, it wasn't until we walked into the place and I saw bikes hanging on the wall. I thought, \"Why do they have bikes in here?\" and then *face palm* Ooooooooh.... BIKE handlebars. Dork that I am, *I* somehow got it into my head that there was some sort of western theme and thought it was something to do with mustaches. Yeah. (Like, handlebar mustache? It could happen. Coffee places like to be clever.)  Husband was thrilled - he loves bicycling so this was right up his alley. \n\n(Another side note: this is where we realized how big the casual/commuter bicycling scene is in Santa Barbara. There were so many bikes parked outside, husband loved it. I am not a cyclist but I appreciated the laidback, fun vibe as opposed to all the competitive, holier-than-thou bike scene here in the Seattle area. BUT I DIGRESS.)\n\nHandlebar Coffee! We liked it so much we went back a couple of times. The place had great atmosphere and was unassuming - it wasn't right smack in the middle of downtown so it was a little quieter though still busy. Nice, simple outdoor seating area. I dig the scene here. The staff was nice and the small selection of pastries they had was good. Husband got a drip and I got a latte, both excellent. We love SB and plan on going back as often as we can - Handlebar will be our go-to coffee place every time.",

Which sucks, because being sexy does not come as naturally as the dirt under my nails. Buuuut the reason why I love this place is because of the Yards Brawler. Before Yards Brawler I was doing shameful things like ordering Snakebite and Bloody Ho's (beers mixed with framboise) and getting MOCKED for it. Now, The Brawler is my go-to order. My friend and I got the sampler pack a couple of years ago when we were young and experimental and it's like finding your favorite pair of jeans that never stretch out. You feel comfortable ordering it and people don't mock you-- in fact they mistake you for liking beer and being the cool down to earth beer chick.\n\nAlso this review is for the COMPANY which rocks a solid A in my books. They do so many things for the Philadelphia community (and beyond) that I love them. I mean this is the site where I've been to the MOST fundraisers oddly enough. haha! Love it!",

It's just so fresh, delicious, and guilt free. \n\nOne day I passed by and saw a loooong drive through line and decided to jump on the band wagon. \n\nI was surprised at how fast they were handling business. Pretty impressive being that they just opened. On top of that, every worker I've encountered has been nothing but nice and well informed. \n\nMy favorite sandwich is the #2  spicy deluxe sandwich with Chick fil A sauce. It's so spicy, but in a good way. Eating the juicy spicy chicken patty along with the buns, cheese, tomato, lettuce and sauce is just the best. Everything is incredibly well balanced. \nI mistakenly ordered the regular spicy chicken sandwich without cheese, lettuce and tomato one day and it wasn't nearly as good. \n\nI was surprised at how fresh the chicken was. I could see the moisture after taking a bite out of it, just as when I cook chicken at home fresh from the market.\n\nChick fil A must have the healthiest, tastiest and smartest kid's meals on the planet. The nuggets are fresh and delicious just like their sandwiches. For sides they have great options- applesauce or a fresh fruit cup. Their fruit cup was legit. It had mandarin oranges, blueberries, strawberries and apples and everything was so fresh. I also love their drink options-milk or organic juice. To top things off, they include a fun educational toy such as I spy booklets or pop out assemble yourself animals. Doesn't get any better than that. Finally a fast food place this mom approves of. \n\nDid I mention that they have the best milk shakes ever? I never order milk shakes but they turned me around all right. Seems like they use real ice cream and fresh milk. Their Oreo and vanilla milk shakes are so delicious and refreshing. They use fresh crunchy cookies and  actual vanilla flavor. The thickness and cool mouth feel is just right too. They top them off with whipped cream and a maraschino cherry. \n\nTry all of their sauces!!!! Sooooooo good. The combinations are endless. I like the Chick fil A sauce the most but also like combining the ranch with the zesty buffalo.\n\nI've been here more times than I can count because I'm truly addicted. I talked to many workers at every location I go to and all of them swear by Chick fil A, eating here while they're working and even when they're off the clock. That says a lot.",

  "text": "Tried it for the first time on a Saturday and was promptly back there two more times over the next five days. And I don't even live in the city!\n\nI am so excited that there is an establishment in Philly that is a cross between In-N-Out and Bobby's Burger Palace for Vegans! But you really do not have to be Vegan to love the food.\n\nHere's what I have tried so far:\n\nUdon Noodle Salad: Classic tasty Asian salad with Vegan chicken. Really nice taste if a bit overdressed.\n\nCurry Tofu Wrap: I had this for lunch the day after I bought it. Still was delicious. I'm surprised there was such a great Indian taste on this menu. \n\nZiggy Burger: Get this! And order extra special sauce. My new favorite burger!\n\nCrispy HipCity Ranch: Good Italian \"chicken\" sandwich. Not as awesome as the Ziggy.\n\nSweet Potato Fries with cilantro black bean dip: my new favorite Philly fries. Sorry European Republic! Still love you but this great dip is Vegan!\n\nMy wife and I have also had the chocolate chip cookies which are quite good.\n\nOne negative: they have no customer bathroom. According to the very friendly people at the counter it is because they are not zoned for one.\n\nPhilly's Veg/Vegan scene was struggling compared to New York's. Thank goodness HipCity Veg opened to help close the gap.",

  "text": "I was a bit bummed when Phat Bites moved to a new location, but I am pretty sure it's the same distance away from me, so no big loss! However, I drove past it the first time I visited, so keep your eyes peeled. It shares the same space as some nondescript business. \n\nI'm glad that the space is a lot bigger and they now have plenty of parking, even at peak times. The food, menu, and staff are the same. I came in for lunch a few times recently, and if you go early, you are golden. Anywhere between 11-12:00 you are fine. However, I stopped in around 12:30 and the line was long and order taking a bit annoying. I also waited about 15 minutes for my order, so it's not the quickest lunch option out there. When ordering take out, I like for it to be pretty quick, but expect to be at Phat Bites for at least 30 minutes at peak times. \n\nI still love the black bean burger that they offer. It's the best one I've had. I also have ordered a few sides. The kale salad is always great, and the hummus is out of this world! Phat Bites is amazing, so check them out!",

  "text": "On a bright and sunny Wednesday afternoon, I decided to visit Tuesday Morning. I have seen this sign so many times before in other places but have never really thought about what the store sells. Really, this store is all about everything and anything! I walked in and it was like an adventure. I would compare it to Home Goods but it is smaller and not stocked as well. They do have certain sections which were abundantly stocked today: towels/bath section and the pillows. There were stacks of different pillows and they have even categorized them according to size (standard, queen, etc). Unfortunately, they were all firm and extra firm. I have been thinking about getting a new pillow for my dog but I believe she prefers the soft kind. I bought her a firm one once and she didn't use it as much as the softer pillow.\n\nEven though the pillow was a bust, I ended up finding 2 nice, soft bath towels on clearance! They have stickers on their clearanced items which denotes the percentage off of \"Tuesday Morning's\" already discounted price tag.  The towels had the purple sticker which was a 20% off the price tag. I was happy! They were already cheap to begin with. I also found a bottle of body wash for $5.99 with a pink sticker (60% off I believe but I could be wrong) so that was awesome! Can't ever have too many bath/shower things stocked up for rainy days or that dreaded zombie apocalypse.\n\nThe store is not the most organized but I guess I didn't expect it to be. I did read their website before coming in and so I sort of knew what to expect as far as the organization would go.  I could tell though, the staff try their best to keep things in order. \n\nThe staff were very nice and very helpful.  While at the clearance area, I started looking at a pillow at the very top of the shelf and an associate offered to take it down for me. I saw the label on the side read \"Firm\" so I didn't bother and thanked her anyway.  The associate at the counter was very pleasant as well and asked how my new year is going. What a bunch of lovely people! I will be back.",

  "text": "I'd only been for pho twice in my life before checking out this Pho Hoa the other day. For some reason I was mega craving pho over the weekend, so my lovely friend Dianne took me out for some on Monday night. \n\nThe place wasn't very busy around 6:30pm. The service was quick - tea came out right away and was refilled quickly when needed, and our food also came out very fast.\n\nI didn't even look at the entire menu, but skipped right ahead to the pho page. It's cutely split into three categories: pho for beginners, just the regular, and the adventurers' choice. At this point I think the only two things I'm not ready to try are tripe and tendon, so I got the Ph Tái Nm off of the \"regular\" menu - round eye steak and well-done flank. You can get your pho in one of two sizes, regular or large. I got the regular (I think around $7.50) and it was still huge! I couldn't finish the whole thing. There was a ton of meat in there - too much for me, I had to leave some. The broth was so flavourful and kind of sweet and yum. I'm not a pho expert, so it's hard for me to describe the flavours, but I loved it. So good, hot and fresh. I've been craving pho ever since. \n\nPho.",

They have a particular treat served in a shot glass that combines espresso, caramel, and salt, and it will absolutely wake you up.  You can buy their signature blend, affectionately named Road Rage, while in the small shop.  They also serve up some snacks if you need a pick-me-up while shopping about the many adorable shops in Marathon.  It was without a doubt some of the best coffee I have ever had.  I would not recommend this as a coffee house for sitting and doing homework, as its too small, but I would recommend picking up a cup from here on your way to run errands.  You will have the most productive day ever hyped up on this incredibleness.",

  "text": "I really wouldn't recommend this place based on dining experience. First of all, I don't think there's an interior layout in this city, that I've seen, that I hate more than this place. It's seriously maze-like inside. Upon entrance, you'll see a typical large wrap-around bar. Behind that bar, there's a dining area, off to the right - there's a larger dining area split into two. It's just a hot mess of confusion and it doesn't matter anyway because it's not like this place is ever filled to capacity.\n\nNow onto the food, honestly - for a person who really doesn't care too much for Mex or Tex-Mex - the food, from what I've had has been pretty good. But, all in all - this place is more or less a Tex-Mex Dive Bar. Take that how you will.\n\nMy majority of visits to this place has been for sports viewing, which has been great. There's plenty of TVs around.\n\nWing lovers take note: they do them well here. Their offerings are definitely not buffalo wings but what they call \"Texas Ranchero\" - which is basically a light BBQ sauce with a hint of spice, served with a side of ranch. The taste is a little sweet more than anything else. I find them quite delicious and they're often on special during sports games: 1lb (was 2lb) of wings and a pitcher of domestic beer for $12\n\nThis is pretty much just a chill, neighborhood bar with Tex-Mex offerings with drink specials. Don't go here for mind-melting dining experience.",

I love the concept of eating on a boat; eating is one of the most enjoyable and frequent activities that I engage in, and it's fun to switch up the atmosphere a little bit every once in awhile. \n\nThat being said, the boat was hauntingly quiet, kind of dark, and just generally somber on the evening that my boyfriend and I dined here. I can't speak to whether or not this is the norm, as it was a frigid Tuesday night in the middle of winter. \n\nDrinks were good, the St. James Lemonade was bomb. \n\nFood was definitely a little above average, but expensive. I'd definitely recommend scooping a Living Social deal if you see one.\n\nWe shared:\n\n-Crab mac n' cheese\n-Philadelphia roll\n-Brussels sprouts\n-Braised short rib gnocchi\n\nThe portions weren't huge, but we ended up having to take home a small box of mac and a few pieces of sushi because we were full. Everything was good, but the mac and sprouts were my favorites.\n\nIt happened to be my birthday, and our (really friendly & helpful) waitress brought out a complimentary scoop of sorbet with a candle in it at the end of the meal. \n\nOverall, it was a nice, quiet evening with solid food, but you're definitely paying a premium to be eating on the river.",

  "text": "I've heard tons of good things about Prep & Pastry, so when my fiance and I drove by last Sunday morning, I suggested we stop for brunch.\n\nWhen we walked in, the hostess said it would be about a 45 minute wait, but she wasn't sure since some people had left without telling her. Looking around the restaurant, there were quiet a few empty tables, and there didn't seem to be too many people waiting, so I was slightly confused. But since we weren't in a rush or grungry (the anger of being overly hungry), we decided to wait.\n\nLuckily, we had only been sitting outside for about 15 minutes when our name was called. The interior is super cute! I really liked the high ceilings and how bright the restaurant was. It was definitely the perfect atmosphere for a lazy Sunday brunch.\n\nAfter much deliberation, we finally made our decisions and ordered.  I ordered the breakfast poutine and my fiance had the chx + toast (fried chicken strips, rosemary brioche french toast, and a blueberry syrup). My poutine was just okay. It was a solid portion, but kind of bland, and I definitely didn't see any cheese curds. On the other hand, my fiance loved his dish! I thought the different components sounded weird on paper, but once I had a bite, I was sold! The chicken was flavorful, and the rosemary french toast was the perfect savory accompaniment, but I do wish it was a little less soggy. However, I did think the chicken was on the dry side.\n\nAlthough we didn't have room to sample their pastries, they all looked amazing. I will definitely be trying one on my next visit.\n\nI think overall, I would give Prep & Pastry 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding it up to 4 since I think I would be happier if I got a different dish next time. Also, I don't think the wait would be so bad on most weekends, but the Sunday we went was super windy, so I don't think many people wanted to sit outside.",

  "text": "Okay sushi. Very friendly service. The restaurant itself was well decorated and clean.  \n\nFollowed the yelp reviews here expecting the best sushi in the area, but was a little disappointed.  The price and portions are fair, but the execution was middling.  Went there twice this week just to be sure. On my first visit I ordered Miyazaki, Osaka and Green dragon.  Then on my 2nd visit Pink lady, Monster roll and Pacific Blue.  The issue is that they rely too much on cheap flavoring like spicy mayo and eel sauce which smothered my Monster and Pacific rolls. They also overuse frying and cream cheese.  Their sushi dishes seem to lack freshness and balance.\n\nI still give them a 4 for having a great atmosphere and great customer service.  I think it's a great place to introduce sushi to someone, but veteran sushi lovers may be more cynical.",

Their sauces are made in house, my favorite is the creamy garlic!\n\nSweet potato fries are also really good for a fast food restaurant, love that spiced marshmallow dip. It is \"spiced\" as in a warm, fall \"spiced\", not the taste of spicy.\n\nOnly complaint is my Pumpkin Spice Milkshake, which is amazing, had PLENTY of strawberry pulp in it. I'm not sure how the milkshakes are made but I'd assume the machine is not regular cleaned after the previous shake is made... I am glad I am not allergic and only simple dislike strawberry seeds/pulp (or pulp of any sort), but honestly wasted my money because I did not drink it all because of the pulp present.

I'm glad I was able to sample all of them, because I found a few varieties that I loved.\n\nThey didn't have DFG (which is my one of my favorite beers available at Bier and also just overall in Indy), but they did have an IPA I hadn't tried before called Bubonic Chronic. It was pretty tasty and I drank a pint to kill some time before dinner. I also loved their Pumpkin Porter and Pumpkin Ale, and brought home a bullet of the Pumpkin Ale to go.\n\nThey had live music, and a chill vibe. Most of the people in the tap room were between 30 - 50 years old, which lends a different atmosphere to some of the other breweries in Indy.",

Tijuana which it the more traditional style with onions and cilantro and frankly I can't remember the 3rd, I should have gotten a picture of the menu.  The menu also includes Mexican style corn on the cob, Flatuas, so many delicious options.  \n\nI tried the Xtreme style shredded chicken. I loved all of the toppings, the chicken was a bit dry but overall good.  I also had Tijuana style al pastor absolutely delicious.  Don't forget to order the chips and salsa.  Full of wonderful flavor and homemade chips that have the right amount of crunch and flavor without being burnt.\n\nMy 2 tacos, chips and Salsa was just over $12 so in my opinion the prices are pretty standard.

Arrived around 6pm and we were seated immediately at one of the outdoor tables, on a nice and warm evening.\n\nI ordered the Pimm's Cup, which was a fantastic, well-balanced, light drink with lemon, real ginger, and cucumber flavours. It was less of a punch to the head than a real whiskey while still being more legitimate than some fruity girly \"drink\" that is really just juice. A perfect accompaniment to the meal.\n\nMy friend ordered \"Canucks in Tennessee\", which I got a kick out of as a Canadian (eh?). Strong rye whiskey with a nice sweet note from maple syrup. Both drinks were very well-balanced.\n\nThe lobster mac and cheese was a lovely $18 indulgence, but not something I'd casually go for again due to calorie count and price. That said, absolutely worth trying at least once, since it was quite well made. A substantial amount of meat too, and unlike other reviewers, I don't think it was all rubbery claw meat.\n\n[ conclusion ]\nStill a bit pricey, but absolutely worth it.

School was hard and drinks were necessary. When they arrived, they found a cozy patio with twinkling white lights, pretty blue chairs, and mason jars aglow with tea lights. The margaritas in this magical place made them wonder if they'd floated away to NeverNeverLand! The queso too was a dream. So every week, they returned and returned for the happiest of hours spent on the patio with friends. And never did this place disappoint. One day they realized they could order margaritas by the pitcher! (thus saving precious coins) and a lovely man named Jimbo never let them down in his mixing. \n\nThe tacos were a wonder too. The fish was so good, and the lobster specials incomparable. Even the fresh veggie side sprinkled with queso fresca didn't disappoint. They were even willing to appease some of the people who had strange requests, like selling a single avocado. As time wore on, the taco sizes got bigger! This pleased the poor grad students and made their bellies happy. The more often they went, the more they were recognized, and the kind staff would sometimes give them free guacamole to go with their queso and chips. The grad students never felt so rich.\n\nThey vowed to continue this tradition until the end of their days.",

  "text": "V Street sets a new standard for vegan restaurants. I came here with a colleague at her recommendation, as there is a sister restaurant back in D.C. called Fancy Radish, and this meal was GREAT! Highlights included:\n\n-Kung Pao Vegetables: While I am not normally one to take to grilled celery, the kung pao sauce and peanut combination was a great take on this dish.\n-Peruvian Potatoes: FIRE! Honestly, most aji amarillo that I had in Peru did not have a very strong flavor, but this aji, married with peanut and pepper, was a nice, spicy spin on potatoes. We were both practically sopping up the sauce with the potatoes. Mmmmm\n-KFT Tacos: This dish was the least remarkable for me, and the radish kimchi tasted much less pickled than normal radish kimchi (which I'm actaully totally fine with). \n-Spicy Dan Dan Noodles: You can taste the sichuan pepper in these, and it is a great addition to the menu! \n-Falooda: This was the star of the show for sure! Typically a dessert associated with some parts of India, it featured pistachio ice cream (which was absolutely perfect and didn't taste too much of pistachio--a positive), basil seeds that almost look like tiny boba on top, sweetened milk, and probably something that is mildly addictive in there because I could have easily had four of these. The flavor combination was rich and each part was highly complementary of the others. Yesssss\n\nThey also had a \"Kisi\" Georgian wine, which I ordered and they asked if I wanted to try first. While I've had other Georgian skin contact wines before, each of them can be a very different experience and all tend to be bold and distinctive. I was not in love with the Kisi, mainly due to the flavor left on the palate after the wine is actually consumed. All that said, I switched to the West of Kyoto, which has Japanese plum whisky and banana cognac (you read that right, but it actually doesn't taste like banana at all) and was quite refreshing. I also enjoyed the Summer Gold cocktail, a sherry-based drink with tepache (Mexican fermented pineapple beverage), and some other great things. \n\nService was friendly and attentive, and I felt like the dishes were coursed at just the right times. I would totally be down to come back here again, and given that there menu is highly seasonal, I'd be able to try loads of new dishes. \n\nTake a bow, V Street. Well done.",

  "text": "I wanted to love this little cupcakery. Nothing makes me happier than discovering an independent cupcake bakery in the sea of cupcake chains. The store itself is charming and filled with much more than baked goods.  Probably a good thing since some of the baked goods, I am sorry to say, just aren't that good. \n\nThere is a glass case housing a small assortment of cupcakes.  There are also additional options available.  It looks as if the cupcakes are baked fresh each day.  Some are frosted and tucked into the case and others are frosted after they are ordered.   The case also contains brownies (frosted and unfrosted) and  other little treats.  There is also a small case loaded with cookies...eight different kinds if I remember correctly.  You can add frosting to them for a small charge.\n\nMy daughter picked two Oreo cupcakes and two Confetti cupcakes.  Each one had about three inches of frosting swirled on top Gi-Gi style. They were carefully packed into a box complete with tape on the bottom to keep them from tipping over.   I was torn between a frosted brownie and several cookies so I bought them all... a brownie, chocolate chip, triple chocolate and oatmeal with orange frosting.\n\nThe cookies are great.  My girls declared the triple chocolate their favorite.  I am smitten with the oatmeal.. rich, chewy and perfect with the orange frosting.  The brownie was pretty good.  It too was rich and chewy.  There was just a sameness to it that made me wonder if it came from a mix.\n\nThe cupcakes were a big disappointment.. or perhaps I should say the cupcake frosting was a big disappointment.  The cake itself had a good flavor.  The frosting was not good at all.  My daughters wouldn't eat it.   At best, it is too heavy with shortening and at worst, it is a pre-made and too heavy with shortening.  I had a hard time washing it off my hand.\n\nI think we would have loved the cupcakes with better (homemade?) frosting.   Perhaps next time?",

I passed by it several times, and though that place looks interesting. After awhile, my mind starting asking, \"Why haven't you gone to Mood Cafe?\" So, I finally took these thoughts out of my mind and tried to get my wife to go. At first, she was a skeptic and did not want to go. On my third attempt, she finally gave me the why not approval.\n\nAfter going, we both should be asking, what is wrong with us. This place Amaze! It looks like a small place with not much to offer. The two main menu items are Lassis and Chaat. I've had a Lassi before, and it's always been Mango. But this place had like 25 Lassi flavors. But what is a Chaat I wondered?\n\nThe owner who was working there on our visit explained. There is so much that goes into a Chaat, he lost me somewhere along the way. But what was not lost was my intrigue. I go the Crazy Chicken Chaat. The crazy was their way of saying it's a chicken and beef combo. The beef reminded me of taco meat, but the kind that is seasoned extremely well.\n\nWatching him make the Chaat was like watching an artist. It was like Jackson Pollack at work with the piling on so much stuff. A threw a bunch of stuff down. Then he added 3-4 sauces. He threw more stuff down. Added more sauces. And then he threw more stuff down. Not sure I remember it all, but there was mango, almonds, crispy noodles, dates, potato, and, and, and... yeah that's what I remember. But I know there was more.\n\nWhen I put this goodness in my mouth, it was like a party of flavors. It tasted so fresh and nothing like anything I had tasted before. I was in love.\n\nI also had a peach Lassi which was excellent. My wife had the same dish as me, but got the blueberry Lassi. I liked her Lassi even better.\n\nI so am going back to this place. You should go too!",

One of my gal pals recommended Get your Grub on and also gave me fair warning I would be going to a garage! \n\nThe owner Mr. Green welcomed me with a handshake, a personal touch I appreciated. I went with the crab leg platter which included corn, broccoli, potatoes, sausage, & shrimp. He made it fresh so allow about 20 minutes if you don't order ahead. He has a huge TV and satellite radio to entertain you while you wait.  \n\nWhen he brought out the final product I just had to stare at it fora bit. A. Work. Of. Art. Once I got past the beauty I dove in. Instead of the normal butter sauce you find on these meals he has a special grub sauce that has a spicy kick that I love. No oily mess, straight flavor! I could have ate a pound of the shrimp alone with the grub sauce. \n\nI have a new favorite to get seafood!",

  "text": "Most people would argue that St. Louis is a beer town. I tend to agree with them. However, I've found that St. Louis is also a great place for wine lovers. Between the wineries in the county and the wine bars in the city, there are plenty of places to get in touch with your inner wino. \n\n3500 Winehaus combines your favorite neighborhood bar with a touch of class in South City. While there is limited seating inside, 3500 Winehaus offers patio seating out front and in back. The front patio offers a ton of extra seating and even space heaters. The back patio sports a firepit - great for those chilly St. Louis nights in the fall. \n\nThe atmosphere is cozy and friendly, much like the service. The kind employees let us sample some of the wine before we committed to a glass or bottle. They have a fantastic menu that includes dozens of red, white, and blush wines for every budget and taste. They even boast a decent selection of beer, whiskey, scotch, and cigars. The decoration is sharp and elegant, but not overdone. \n\nTheir small plates complement the wine very nicely. We've ordered a few of the cheese plates and they were quite tasty. \n\nIf you're looking for a change of pace in South City, this would be a great place for a date, girl's night, or work place happy hour.",

The restaurant with wooden clean interior is housed in a warm comfortable place, and the menu of meat options as well as sides here was impressive. \n\nThe food options are typical of a Tennessee bar bq restaurant, except that Edley's perhaps has the best Texas beef brisket in town, and it makes choosing between the brisket and the excellent pork sandwich pretty difficult. I chose the green beans and tasty mac n cheese for my sides, but I'll have to say that the Brunswick stew looked very enticing. The jalapeño cornbread was a bit dry, but I loved that they grilled the cornbread before serving it on the plate. \n\nI had few expectations of Edley's, but I think it now moves to my top 3 Nashville bar-b-que joints, and it's a nice place to enjoy it too.",

  "text": "First LOVE the concept of BFF Café, the concept is long overdue, and SORELY needed! \n\nI tried BFF a while back on a Monday and found out there only do Fuel Packs, which is take and heat at home and or you can heat up there. That didn't interest me, so I said I would be back. \n\nI arrived today, and was excited to eat here, as I tried a small sample at a Yelp Elite Event (YEE). I ordered at the counter with a younger gentlemen and it wasn't busy to me, 1 guy waiting and 2 people already eating, and 1 couple behind me. \n\nI asked what to order as I was REALLY HUNGRY, and the gentlemen right off the bat said the Bison Burger ($16) without skipping a beat. I rarely eat bison and I was craving what I had at the YEE, and next he said Paleo Hunter Zoodle, either one was super filling. \n\nTotal for food was $3 for Cauliflower Fingers, $12 for the Paleo Hunter Zoodle. A full check plus small tip was just over $17, that's w/out a drink! I consider this a high price point for a lunch. \n\nI thoroughly checked over restaurant, something feels missing here, not sure, what best describes. My best interpretation is it's feel like an empty cafeteria, order here, fill your drink here, get condiments over there, and bus your table, basically no service, order, and just wait. I had a number on my table and the food comes out, a bit slow considering there was 1 order in front of me, and I think the dish I ordered much of it was pre-made like braised beef, vegetable noodles, etc. \n\nMy dish arrives and it looks naked, I only ate a sample at the YEE, so I didn't know why it felt naked, but I felt like there should be a sauce over it or on the side, as it looks very much NAKED, I was quite confused because my cauliflower (C) fingers had a salsa side. I tried the C fingers first, as it's my guess is it's the C pizza, cut into strips, to make the fingers. I had enough salsa for about half of them, and it was okay, kind of cool to be able to order a unique side, but wouldn't need to order it again, as the flavor was okay to below okay, not enough C for me (also no notations on nutrition on this dish nor other hand-helds???) \n\nI am looking at my main dish the Paleo Hunter, and again, it feels so naked, I start thinking about what sauces I can add to it, but nothing looks like a match, but I did notice a wasabi in the cooler when waiting to order, and thought if it's real wasabi that might give it a bit of flavor and heat, and at least add much much needed moisture to this dish that looks like it needed something to blanket. Please note, I did ask cashier, who said it was okay to grab the wasabi dixie cup from the cooler.  \n\nI added the sauce very carefully and then being a professional salad tosser (Western Village Steakhouse) from 1994, I tossed my dish expertly and thoroughly in case the wasabi was super hot, which I was HOPING it was! It was NOT! I started eating the dish, and the first I notice it was below lukewarm in temperature, it was just between cold and luke warm, I was quite confused. \n\nI spent only about 2-3 minutes eating the C fingers, so that couldn't be it, the wasabi from the cooler was about 1.5 oz Dixie cup, carefully poured to cover the dish, why was my dish almost cold, maybe that's how they do it here, it's a unique place, serving unique, maybe they don't want the nutrients to cook off??? I wasn't sure, but then again, I really didn't want to just eat it and assume, so I waited to talk to the cashier, who really just takes orders and gets food from the back, but all of the sudden it took over 5 minutes and a phone order, to get his attention. \n\nI said, should my food be almost cold? He said yeah maybe, because it didn't sit under the heat lamp that long. I was still puzzled so I said, how was it cooked? He said on the stove. I was was still puzzled, his answer was that yeah, if it goes from the stove to the plate to your table that happens. Okay, I decided to eat the food as it was, and as I did I realized, I was never eat here again, so it's really simple, just eat, leave, and a solid review, to let my fans know the biz (I want to save you $$, if you value it)! \n\nAgain love the concept of BFF, but based on today experience THIS PLACE IS NOT FOR ME! Last but not least, as I was relaying the story to co-workers, because you know the power of a bad experience, you usually share 10x and a good experience 1x, I remembered, looking at the menu, and then I remembered being at my YEE event, that this dish is suppose to have a Blanket, which today was Missing, and that is the Chimichurri Sauce! That was another aha moment of the terrible experience I had today. \n\nLast note the cashier told me that they had a big rush before me that's why the food didn't sit under the heat lamp long enough to warm up the food, I guess that big to go order before me really stressed the chef! The guy sitting down that I saw leave with a bag of food probably for a family of 2-3 adults and 2-3 kid, that's PRESSURE!",

  "text": "The Betsy Ross House is a very cheap historical tourist thing to do while you spend a day learning about American history. For only $5 you can visit the home where Betsy Ross and her husband, John Ross, once lived and for an additional $3 you can get the audio tour. However please note that it is believed that Betsy Ross only lived here for a short time of her life.\n\nMy husband and I came here on a Thursday afternoon, a little before 3 pm. We walked through the courtyard and into the gift shop to pay for admission. We decided to forgo the audio tour and just read all of the little boards. From this tour, you will learn that Elizabeth, or as commonly known as \"Betsy\" Ross was born into a Quaker family. She did her apprenticeship with an upholster and really learned the craft quite well. She eventually met his first husband, John Ross, who was also an upholster, and fell in love.\n\nBeing from a Quaker family, her family did not support the marriage of Betsy and John. They eventually opened their own upholstery business, which surprisingly General George Washington (yep that Washington) was one of their biggest customers. Unfortunately John passed away after being married for only 2 years, during war time. Betsy eventually remarried to a man named Joseph Ashburn, in which they had 2 daughters. But one of their daughters passed away after 9 months. Sadly her second husband also died too. Things weren't really looking that great for Betsy since she was now a widow again, before the age of 30.\n\nBetsy Ross remarried a 3rd time, John Claypoole. He came to tell her that her 2nd husband died and eventually they fell in love. They were married for 34 years and had 5 daughters. Sadly only 1 survived into adulthood. \n\nThe self guided tour of the house itself was very basic and it was bothersome to read the story boards around the house when there were several people crowding around it. My husband and I would just come back to those boards to read once people moved to other parts of the rooms to read. One room that I thought was interesting was when we met an actress who played Betsy Ross in which she would tell visitors about her life and could answer questions. She also taught visitors how to cut a 5 pointed star (you may pick up a small handout at the gift shop if you would like a copy or check out my photo), stating that was much easier to make a 5 pointed star instead of a 6 pointed star how George Washington had initially intended for the US Flag to have. \n\nNow there is some controversy that Betsy Ross did not create the first flag. Whether you believe that or not is your own opinion. But the history is here to learn about her life and how this may have come to pass (or if it is a legend that she made the first US Flag). \n\nOverall, this was a nice little tour that we completed in about 30 minutes. I wouldn't make a special trip to go out here, but if you are already touring other places like Independence Hall and The Liberty Bell, then consider making a visit. \n\nPlease note that inside the home, there are narrow, spiral steps that are not handicap accessible. Also there are restrooms located downstairs in the gift shop basement. \n\nAnd lastly in the court yard, you can find Betsy Ross's grave. If you are interested in listening to free story telling, there is an employee who is out there that does that at various times. Also there is a small little food cart that sells soft pretzels, water ice, water, hot dogs, chips, etc in case you are hungry.",

For several years it was in a different location, and now it is attached to the new Inn at 500 hotel.\n\nWe tried some of their signature entrees, including cannelloni and chicken with forty cloves of garlic. The cannelloni was some of the best I have ever ordered in a restaurant. The garlicky chicken was moist and extremely flavorful! The service was great; our server Shana did an amazing job! \n\nThe ambiance and atmosphere was classy and upbeat with a full house during dinner time.\n\nI plan to definitely go back to Richard's any time I return to the Boise area.",

  "text": "The Three Coins Diner is simply a-okay. It is your typical greasy spoon diner, which happens to be my favorite kind of diner. The greasier, the better... only sparingly though or else I'd be in some serious trouble! I found Three Coins to be modest and simple, which I really like. The service at Three Coins was your typical friendly diner-style service from a lady that called us \"hun\" and made sure my hubby's coffee was always filled.\n\nIn a nutshell: The food was alright. The service was fast. Coffee refills when needed. Nice venue for people watching at the outside patio. But something was missing from my ham steak, eggs and potatoes breakfast dish. What if I said it wasn't greasy enough for me? I really think I wanted more \"grease\" to my meal. Not to worry though, I'm certain we will return. I'll keep my fingers crossed that they add some extra love to my breakfast next time. ;-)",

  "text": "Was visiting New Orleans for the first time a few weeks ago -- 5/6 of us were first timers -- and our friend's friend who lives in the area recommended Kajun's when we expressed that we wanted to go out and sing in an environment a little less...everything...than Cat's Meow (which we'd walked into and promptly out of the night before). \n\nKajun's reminded us so much of our favorite dive-y karaoke spot in Brooklyn. The crowd was eclectic and welcoming -- especially towards my friend who was out in full drag. Appreciated the organized ordering process at the bar and was impressed by the speediness of the bartenders. Also loved the beautiful Día de los Muertos altar in the window. \n\nSo happy that someone pointed us in this direction!",

  "text": "What's not to love about this relatively new \"secret\" Jose Garces restaurant!? It definitely lives up to its title of giving off buena onda (if you don't know what it means, look it up!) \n\nMostly, I love the clean and charming decor that oozes with happy feels! The service was also friendly and upbeat, and the food tasted great. I'd especially recommend the fish tacos, which is the essence of its menu. And yes, I'll reiterate again with everyone else that the free samples of beer while you're waiting in line might be the most ingenious treat that a restaurant has come up with!\n\nI came on a Sunday afternoon with a fairly large group (approx 10 of us), and we took up a good chunk of the establishment. Since it was relatively empty that day, we were able to pool several of the tables together and had a great time! I'm definitely looking forward to visiting again soon!",

  "text": "Typically I love going in here on lunch, or also for a snack and blow off a little steam. \n\nThe decor is pretty sweet for what it is; typically the food is par or better. The Shewman Special is a unique burger that is a personal favorite. I've ordered this probably half of the times that I've had food. \n\nThe appetizers are certainly not a dollar menu, but are typically what I would consider good in quality. Not gouging or anything. \n\nI've had some \"questionable\" service we will say... As a long time visitor here, I seem to feel like the service was much better in the past. \n\nI have a little bit bitter of a taste in my mouth from a lunch experience many months ago (part of why I really haven't been much anymore...). \n\nI ordered the endless soup lunch special. I ordered my third soup bowl after having been seated for somewhere around 25-30 minutes. Many minutes go by, I do not have my soup. I asked another server (ours seemed to temporarily be MIA). They said they would check. \n\nOur server reemerged, apologized, and offered a Togo soup (as our table had requested our bill, some needing to go back to work). I explained that it really wasnt needed, I was just going to pick away at it before going back to work. So they talk me into taking it anyway. Another server that was roped in came back and told me he was not aloud to give carryout soup since it was the special. Must say, was in a bit of a condescending tone too. \n\nYou offered it, I said no, you talked me into it, then chastise me as though I'm trying to pull a fast one. All I did was ask for a refill 20 minutes prior during my lunch hour. \n\nI've been back a few times, but I'm still a little reluctant to resurface here too often.",

  "text": "Always excited to try a renowned pizza place. We search hi and low on our road trips to find the best places to eat. Serial Grillers had high reviews so we got excited especially to show my son who loves thrillers.\nCalled ahead to order for pick up since we were crunched for time and driving on for hours to reach El Paso. Found out the xl 20\" cost $21. Not too bad considering we had another pizza that cost way more near Yosemite. Ordered a calzone too since reviews said they were good. My health nut daughter ordered the Apple cranberry salad half Sweeney Todd. We hoped it was big but it wasn't that big. More like a side salad size. Really wanted to try some wings but they said $7 for about 6-7. We were hungry n opted to get the calzone instead. \nGot there and used their restrooms. Cute horror movie posters in the women's.  Dingy inside but hip and dank. Service was ok. They had our order ready and sitting there so it wasn't as fresh and hot as we liked. They weren't the friendliest either but there wasn't any problems. In and out.\nPizza was ok. We had better. It was a tad dry n again not hot. Yes slightly disappointed and not sure if it's just this one case since reviews were high. Calzone was ok. I think our standards maybe a tad high too because we had the best calzone and thin crust pizza in San Diego and elsewhere that we keep comparing these to. \nSalad was ok too. Nothing too wow.\nGlad we had food in our tummies but nothing to rave about. Glad we tried that's all.",

  "text": "This to me, is a luxury beauty bar. It was enjoyable for sure, but I'd only come here maybe once a month for the extra pampering and a partial complimentary drink. The prices are more than I'd pay for a pedi, but it was a great experience. The chairs are large white luxurious thrones for two. I did the Nouvelle pedi which includes a paraffin wax to soften dry cracked feet. Since my feet are so rough and cracked, yeah my feet aren't perfect people, I chose this. It was a wonderful treatment! My tech was Linh, she was so nice and gentle. I told her I like my nails cut to the shortest they can get them, and she listened to my wishes. I enjoyed a nice foot massage, and since my heels are chapped she brought out this cheese grater looking tool. It was ticklish and then afterward I was completely shocked how much better my feet looked and felt! Next followed a leg exploitation, and then a massage with a lotion or clay type mask. Then, se brought out the two bags of the pink wax. It was hot at first, but then it began to cool.  After it was dry, she removed the bags and the wax came off with ease. Lastly, she rubbed my legs down wth lotion. Now, I have a thing if it's too much lotion and it's a greasy slipper feel. Once we left, my husband noticed my legs had lotion caked and streaked on and it was very noticeable. I tried to blend it in, but it was already dried. When we get to La V for lunch I had to wash my legs off. I will definitely go back next month for more pampering, but in between I'll get a pedi at a normal price. My husband had mentioned when he came w Malary that they refilled their glasses during their pedis a few times, but today, we never were offered anymore. I love how my feet look at feel now! They also gave me useful tips on how to keep my heels soft and well moisturized between pedis. I look forward to going back whether I'm alone, with a friend or my husband. I'd like to get my eyebrows waxed next time. Clean salon, well lit with elegant chandeliers and clear pendant lighting. White booths for clients and a back room for the brow waxing and such. You can also order food and La V will deliver while you're being pampered. Free lunch w pedi 10-3 on week days. Friendly staff and willing to take a photo of you and your guest. Thanks for a wonderful experience!",

  "text": "Yay!  Yet another grocery store in town!  I was actually pretty glad to hear Sprouts was coming to Tampa - I had shopped at one in Alabama, and loved their ready-to-eat section.\n\nSince I went on opening week, the parking lot was full as I expected, but fortunately the store is in the center of a huge strip mall, and there was plenty of parking to be had in front of other stores.\n\nSide Story #1 - as I was walking back to my car, I watched as a car pulled in next to mine, flung open her door, and whacked my car.  When I walked up to inspect it and said, \"Hey, you hit my car!\" the response I got back was an angry (at me) \"I barely touched it!\".  I suppose an \"I'm sorry\" was too much to hope for, in this day and age.\n\nWhen I walked into Sprouts, the first thing I noticed was the enormous selection of produce. I have heard it compared to Trader Joes and Fresh Market, but this section looked larger and fresher than either of those stores.  I also loved that they had a huge variety of fresh cut flowers and plants.\n\nSince I couldn't wait to get in and out of the madness that was the store on this day, I headed straight to the area that had pre-packaged food, and bought a smorgasbord of items to go:  buffalo nuggets (very spicy), turkey meatloaf with vegetables (surprisingly filling and good), a premade sandwich with deli buffalo chicken and tomatoes, which sadly had very soggy bread from the tomatoes, and falafel balls (see Side Story #2).  My biggest complaint with all the to-go food was that it was hard to get the plastic lids off, and that the plastic lids could not go in the microwave.\n\nSide Story #2 - the falafel balls are supposed to be microwaved for 2-3 minutes before eating them. I took the lid off, took the sauce out, and heated them up. They came out perfectly, and were delicious. There were so many in there though, I saved about half of them for the next day. Next day, heated the remainder up, and after about a minute the whole microwave started to smoke and I had to rush over and dump the flaming falafel balls in the sink!  Phew!  Boy did my house stink!  Apparently the falafel balls are a one-time-heat-up type thing - who knew?\n\nSo, other than the falafel excitement, I will definitely be heading back to Sprouts to try some of their other ready-made options.",

The billboard outside Biggies advertising their Tuesday daily special of beef stroganoff was the deciding factor (I love the dish), though the exterior of the restaurant did nothing to draw me (older looking & divey, not my typical haunt).  The interior kept up the same theme - everything looks kind of old and worn, though very clean...including the bathrooms.\n\nIt's a much larger menu than you would expect: Appetizers, Soups, Salads, Sandwiches, Entrees, and Pastas.  I was pleasantly surprised the breaded cauliflower wasn't drowned in batter & you could taste the vegetable.  The strogonoff was amazing, with large chunks of meat and a rich cream sauce.  Service was fast and friendly.\n\nFrom what I was told, daily specials are always spot-on and I \"have to come back for the fried chicken!\" - 1/2 chicken & a side salad\n\nTues: Beef Strogonoff\nWed: Meatloaf w/ Mashed Potatoes & Corn or Prime Rib\nThurs: Pork Steak or Fried Chicken\nFri: Sole Parmesan or Pork Cutlet\nSat: BBQ Ribs St. Louis Style or Baby Back Ribs\nSun: Fried Chicken",

  "text": "We really used to love going to TailGate.  They do a good job of always having new beer on tap and that is a huge plus.  However, the service is just not good.  I am guessing there is a lot of turnover, because the staff always seems to be different when we go in.\n\nThe last few times that we had poor service, and I appreciate that the owners/managers reached out to me.  I am not the type of person who will go into a venue and ask for a manager just so that I can get something for free.  I also don't want special treatment.  I like to go in and see how the staff treats every customer.  \n\nLast night we left and my BF said it was the last time we will go there.  It was the third time in a row that the service was just not good.  The evening started well.  We sat at the bar.  The restaurant was relatively slow for a Saturday night.  We were greeted and given our drinks right away.  But once again, it was hard to get another drink ordered.  We sat there with empty glasses while three staff played a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.  We could not get anyone's attention.  Then a large group of people came in.  Two of the staff disappeared and left one guy at the bar serving all of these people.  Made no sense.  And so we continued to sit there with empty glasses.  That is when we decided to leave.  But we could not flag anyone down to get our check.\n\nI get it when you are busy.  But look up, acknowledge that your customers are waiting and just say \"I will be with you in a minute.\"  I just hate it when bartenders don't make eye contact, don't look at the bar to see who MIGHT need a drink or food or something and you get ignored.",

I got there a little after 11:45 and was informed that they were just doing wings either 6 or 12.  I love bonchon chicken in NYC so the wings were a perfect option for me.

Total wait time was probably about an hour, but it was a nice day so brought my yelp book club book, and sat outside for awhile.  \n\nI went with the honey ginger which was really tasty.  I'm not sure how they do it, but the wings really weren't sticky, yet I could taste the sauce.  Some kind of magic.  The batter is light and super crispy, and the wings were really good quality, with lots of meat on them.  6 is def enough for one person.  I think the plan is for them to have wings every Sunday so I'll definitely be back to try the other sauces.  Bonus: you get a honey donut with the wings.",

  "text": "Aloft Tampa Downtown is one of the newest additions to the Aloft family which now claims around 100 hotels worldwide. The hotel chain tags itself as a \"destination sensation with loft-inspired design and free-flowing energy.\" In simpler terms, Aloft is a hotel designed for the Google/Apple generation. It bucks the system that has been created by traditional hotels in every way imaginable.    \n\nLast Tuesday we had the opportunity to experience this \"destination sensation\" firsthand. Downtown parking can be a bit problematic but Aloft takes care of that by offering a valet service that is charged directly to your room. This makes everything so easy because when you pay for check out, you also pay for your car. Upon entering the hotel I was immediately floored by the multicolored lights, the crazy furniture and the upbeat trendy music that was being piped through the speakers. It is definitely a much updated (and needed) look to the stuffy old hotel lobbies of the past. \n\nUnlike traditional hotel reception areas that are built in a straight line along one wall, Aloft's reception area sits right in the middle of the floor. The desk is rounded, making it appear futuristic. It makes the experience less like waiting in line at the bank and more like preparing to spend the night on a UFO (or at least what I imagine a night on a UFO might look like). We had not alerted the front desk when booking the room that we would be bringing our sixteen month old so we inquired at the desk about a crib. A man waiting at the desk cracked \"Do they have a crib? They better. I mean they offer pet beds so they should have a place for a real live human.\" I'm not sure if he was joking but he seemed serious enough. Pet beds? That's they kind of place Aloft seems to be. The receptionist immediately radioed someone that we needed a crib and before we had even unloaded our car, a crib had been placed in our room.   \n\nWhen we arrived to our Aloft room, a standard sized one that looked out towards the Downtown Art Gallery, we noticed a number of unique things. First, there was a recycling bin in the room. With the way that recycling has become so prevalent in certain cities I can't understand why more hotels don't offer this option in their room. Score one for the conscientious traveler. The room also offers a safe with customizable code. We didn't use the safe but my daughter loved playing with the buttons. The room was decked out in IKEA style furniture. The shower was all glass and had dispenser for shampoo and body wash (greatly reducing the amount of plastic that is used by hotels I assume). There was a flat screen TV mounted on wall that we didn't get to use but it had a nice placement. To the left of the television was a window that stretched from the floor almost to the ceiling. This really amused the little one as she could stand there and look out at all the cars and people moving around. I also loved that there were outlets for almost any kind of electronic gadget you could imagine and the retro alarm clock was pretty sweet. \n\nThe negatives? Well, there weren't many. One thing was that the standard room is pretty small in the bed area. This was probably made more so by the fact that there was a crib there as well. Don't try to squeeze more than two people and a baby in the room because I could see it getting uncomfortable quick. The refrigerator that was in the room was very small. It was hard to fit our Taco Bus leftovers in it. The shower, despite looking really cool, drained extremely slowly. This could've been user error, but I couldn't figure out a way to get it to move faster.\n\nAloft Tampa is in a great location. It is within walking distance of a number of fabulous eateries as well as Curtis Hixon Park. It makes checking in and parking easy and offers rooms that are funky and relatively functional. Throw in the fact that there is a swanky bar in the lobby and a place to purchase round the clock food and I can't find many reasons why someone wouldn't want to stay at Aloft.",

In fact we went twice in 24 hours & would have liked to pop by today but sadly they were closed for the holiday.\n\nThe menu is extensive offering a variety of gluten-free and gluten-full sweet, savory and boozy creations! On each of our visits, my husband had an ice cream martini while I had what turned out to be the best sundae of my life....creamy Zanzibar chocolate ice cream topped with crunchy brûléed bananas, warm hot fudge and whipped cream. \n\nAll of the toppings and ice cream were gluten free during our visit but that might not always be the case. Due note that not all of the martini components are gluten free. While we didn't eat a meal I did try their signature polish pickle potato soup and it was quite tasty! It was a very thick and hearty potato soup filled with bits of diced pickles.\n\nCouple of tips....get on the yelp waitlist before arriving and request a booth if you are less than four people. Also, they sell 8 ounce portions of their hot fudge to go!",

There's something whimsical about this spot and i honestly have a great time every visit I make here.\n\nYou can select a bottle of wine to enjoy on their outdoor patio that's covered with trees with plenty of shade, not to mention, under the sounds of some amazing local talent with their live music.\n\nThe music is what steals my heart each and every single time. The artists and bands are so unique and you'll love hearing them in the back as you're catching up with friends and family.\n\nIf you don't like wine or rosé, you can grab a cocktail or beer at their full liquor bar on the second floor. You can access it outside from the staircase.\n\nIf you're not bent on purchasing a bottle (they're super reasonably priced btw!) you can always order by the glass.\n\nDon't forget to select a few cheeses and build out a charcuterie board, which they present and make for you. Also love they bring it out to your table.\n\nAlways make sure to tip the live music and help support the arts. Many of them have venmo so NO EXCUSES!\n\nTip- if there is a long ass line for the bathrooms outside, sneak upstairs and use one of the bathrooms.

When I am there there is no waiting for machines, and you don't have to scour the change-room for an open locker. \n\nThe gym has a nice selection of machines and free weights, and the pools are fantastic. \n\nI think the badminton courts are the best in the city by a lot, and the tennis courts are great too. \n\nThe Kinsmen Center is not without flaws however. \n\nThere are treadmills in only 1 location, and a few have seen better days. The same few get used all the time while a few others are always vacant. Putting a few good ones in open spots around the upper track would be nice for people wanting a little more seclusion. \n\nThere is no hot tub. There is however a teach pool that is warmer than the regular pool, but I'm not sure if it's designed that way, or it's warmer because all the little kids are peeing in there. \n\nChange-room: A lot of the 26 shower heads seem to have the same issue of spraying out in all directions and have little pressure. I find I use the same 2 or 3 every time, and it seems most use the same ones. \n\nOf course, if I never again see old men with one foot up on the bench, their flabby junk flopping around, chatting with one another instead of putting on some underwear it would still be too soon. Good luck fixing that one Kinsmen Centre!",

  "text": "Horn playing....And they're off! Race season for Tampa Bay Downs starts December 4, 2013 and ends June 30th, 2014. It is located  on Racetrack Road between Tampa (Hillsborough Ave.) and Linebaugh). The gates open at 11:00 AM and the first race is at 12:25 PM, admission is free on weekdays and $2.00 on weekends and $3.00 for clubhouse admission and there is free parking( if you get there early to get a spot, people park miles away) and valet parking is $5.00 .Tampa Bay Downs is the only Thoroughbred race track on the West Coast of Florida.\nTampa Bay Downs first opened in 1926 under the name Tampa Downs and has a long and colorful history, can you believe it is 88 years old this year?.\nIn 1986 the current owner purchased it and it has continually grown.  The millennium brought a host of new amenities: Downs Golf Practice, Silks poker room( open 10:00 AM-4:00 AM) and the card room.  In 1998 Tampa Bay Downs became one of the most popular turf courses in North America.\nEverything including the grandstands is clean and now if you have a smart phone, you can bet right on your phone, but I enjoy the fun of placing my bet and the excitement of the race and cheering my horse along. Usually I get the defeat of loosing, but it is exciting and fun.\nI had a Triple play Nathan's Hot dog while I was there. Well Nathan's is always a good hot dog, the bun was fine and it was topped with generic chili and cheese and then fried onion rings! For a pedestrian dog it sure fit the setting and tasted good and messy. For those who would like a libation they have beer, wine and a full liquor bar to mix you up whatever you are in the mood for.\nI have to say for actually no money during the week and a $2.00 entrance fee on the week-end it is a fun day to spend with friends or just wander around all the places by yourself. Of course if you are inclined to place a few wagers, as I have been known to do, only take what you can afford to loose, without having to cry all the way home.\nWhat's a girl to do? I love animals: horses, ponies, dogs, greyhounds, bandits, black jack... you can tell a lot about a person, if they are an animal lover!",

It was melt in my mouth goodness. The cabbage was great too. Sour, but not too sour to complement the flavor of the corned beef. It's simple, yet so incredibly delicious.

  "text": "So here is a place that I've been wanting to try for a minute, and I finally got my chance.  Rarely am I both near Kennedy and DM and hungry.  \n\nUpon walking up, I was impressed to see a huge sign out front advertising that they use La Segunda Cuban bread.  I was thinking, \"Wow, not bad considering they're a chain from Jax.\"  Well, when I got inside, I was warmly greeted by the staff and my order was quickly taken.  However, after placing my order, I saw a sign claiming they were voted \"Best Cuban.\"  I'm just not buying it.  First off, I want to know who the hell voted a chain \"best Cuban\" in a city, not only where the damn sandwich was invented, but that is also chock-full of places that serve up amazing versions of the sandwich.  Seriously folks, let's get a damn grip here.  It was laughable.\n\nSo I sit down and out comes our sammiches, and they look great.  I got the Kong turkey deal, and my son got a 12\" turkey and cheese.  The sandwich was good, and I love the fact that they use all of these less damaging cold cuts.  No anti-biotics and all that good stuff, but my son looked over at me after dusting off his sammich and said, \"It was good, but I don't see what's so \"giant\" about these sandwiches and it's definitely not the best I've had. I like Firehouse better.\"  He's only 15, but the boy knows sandwiches, and I sadly couldn't help but to agree with him.  In the Jax chain sandwich war, I think Firehouse wins.\n\nAfter eating, I sat there digesting for a moment, and I saw one of those table top rolodex style advertisement things, so I started flipping thru them, and what I saw shocked, amazed and offended me as a Tampanian (see pic).  It was an ad for their Cuban sandwich, or should type, their \"Cuban sandwich.\"  First off, the picture is laughable because it's not even on Cuban bread.  Second, at the bottom, it reads \"straight out of Miami.\"  Whoa!  Hold the fugg up, mofos!  Are you serious with that?  You're going to be a CHAIN restaurant, claiming to have been voted best Cuban by someone somewhere and then have the stones to put an add of one on a table in Tampa depicting a sandwich not even on Cuban bread and then top it off with the words \"straight out of Miami\"???  I can clearly see that some corporate education is needed up in Jacksonville where they wouldn't know a Cuban sandwich if it slapped them in the face,  I've been there on multiple occasions, trust me.\n\nAnywho, the sandwich was good, but not better than Lenny's across the street, nor Jimmy John's a few miles to the east, so I can't ever see going back.",

  "text": "I very rarely venture northeast of Fishtown, but Sweet Lucy's Smokehouse MAY just get me on 95 North more often.  This place is awesome!\n\nOK, now you have to come to Sweet Lucy's realizing that we are in Philadelphia and not in Kansas City, Memphis, North Carolina, or Texas.  We aren't known for our BBQ.  But Sweet Lucy's is one of the better options that I've tried in this area.\n\nWhy is it good?  I like the atmosphere- it's casual but homey.  You order at a counter, pick up at a counter, and seat yourself.  It's also BYOB- which I didn't realize until we got there (damn!).  Since it was a hot day, they had some complimentary italian ice to enjoy while you wait for your food.  I love when places do little things like that to keep their customers happy.  Before we even got our food, I was digging this joint.\n\nMy husband and I each ordered a platter- one pulled pork and one pulled chicken.  I'm not a huge meat eater, but I thought they did a really nice job with the meats. You get a healthy sized portion and they had just the right amount of sauce.  Also, the meat was super juicy.  Places like this convince me to never become a vegetarian.\n\nThe sides we tried were: cornbread, coleslaw, mashed sweet potatoes, cucumber-tomato salad, baked mac n cheese, creamed spinach, and baked beans.  I really like that the platter comes with three sides (although they are all on the smaller side) because it makes it easy to try everything :)  The mac n cheese wasn't really what I would call baked- it was more on the creamy side than baked side.  I loved it anyway.  The other stand-outs were the mashed sweet potatoes and the cornbread.   \n\nWe had plenty of food for dinner that night and lunch the next day (we are lighter eaters).  All that food, plus soft drinks, came to about $25.  They also offer a $20 AYCE buffet on Monday nights.  I think you could probably get plenty of food for less than $20 here, but if buffets are your thing, this sounds like a pretty good deal.\n\nThis would be a perfect place to get a group of friends together for a casual but delicious meal AND you can bring your own beer.  We will definitely be repeat visitors!",

It is super sunny and open and I love that there is outdoor seating in front and in back (with outlets!). There are lots of students studying here as well as locals coming in for their morning or afternoon coffee. \n\nThe staff here are awesome. They are so friendly and go out of their way to adjust menu items if needed. The food is also so good. I love that they make the eggs for their breakfast sandwiches fresh when you order one. They also have amazing soups that change every day.\n\nIt can get a bit crowded on the weekends but usually people move in and out and it isn't too hard to snag a table eventually.",

In the summer months you can get a room for less than a dinner for two at a steakhouse and they have everything to offer for kiddos or those who want to avoid kiddos. \nThe pool was family friendly but not in an annoying way. I enjoyed my time without stepping or slipping on anything ha ha. Bravo to the pool awesomeness and the gorgeous grounds. Tons to do with out ever leaving. Golf, spa, and food.

Simple, hot from the kitchen, and perfect every time.\n\nOverall, their food is always fresh and delicious, the atmosphere is dim and comfortable, and staff are all incredibly nice! Especially the owner/manager, always there to greet us with a smile! We always appreciate it.\n\nI oddly always get a craving to come here on random Mondays, but don't forget, they're CLOSED EVERY MONDAY! Enjoy the buffet, bring the whole family, and chow down! (And maybe gawk at the beautiful colors the food makes on your plate for a second.)\n\nWill add pictures next time I'm in!",

I sat at the bar as I was traveling alone for business so I didn't get the full experience but the good was great. Started with a cocktail which was delightful. The bread that comes out is quite good. Love the little sampler plate. The BBQ shrimp were so good! Definitely get them for an appetizer. The crawfish pasta special was not what I was expecting but quite delish. The soufflé was the only thing that was a bit disappointing. Wish they hadn't served with with the sauce on it as it made it soggy. Flavor was good. Can't wait to come back and have the full experience.",

  "text": "Ok, I've eaten here a few times in the past, and again last night, and it's a bit of a mixed bag of opinions for me.  Things i do enjoy about all Cheeseburger Charleys, is that there made to order, great selection of burgers, and of course there toppings bar.  I'm HELLA fan of flavor, so i love putting a bunch of stuff on my burgers so the bar is nice.  I have had couple of really dry burgers here in the past, so i recommend telling them to cook it medium or even medium rare to ensure a juicy burger.  I also like my fries extra crispy and they accommodated that request too.  Last night though i went on a limb and order the 1/4 Hot Dog, it was very tasty put they cooked it way too long.  I'm going to heed my own advice and mentioned to them not to cook the crap out of it next time.  Didn't think i had to do with the Hot Dog but evidently i needed too.  Overall not a bad place if your craving a quick burger and don't want fast food.  But to tell you the truth i think Rafferty's and Logan's both offer better alternatives in the burger department.

They even have uni here for you sea urchin lovers. Also their desserts are delicious too! Usually with seafood buffets, the desserts are mediocre at its best.

  "text": "The greatness of this place may be lost on you unless you are really into food from all aspects. If you are someone with a sophisticated palate and your bucket list does not go beyond Michelin 2 and 3 star establishments, you will likely disavow The Habit as a legitimate contender for a solid meal. It is a small, nondescript greasy hovel which most people would drive by if they didn't know any better. But if you are like me and look beyond fine dining for the real story behind great food, there is a lot to like here. \n\nThis particular location in Goleta is the original Habit burger stand established in 1969. It is a less well known but just as important institution in the So Cal burger genre along the lines of In-N-Out. And while In-N-Out is still my favorite burger, The Habit has better add ons so I can be happy eating at either and maybe even both in the same day!\n\nThe story here is a tasty charbroiled burger at a decent price. The chargrill taste does add another dimension to the burger which is a nice touch. Their fries are solid and crispy but the newly found show stopper for me on this visit were the Tempura Green Beans. Who knew? I also love that they have a condiment caddy at the window stacked with 3 free kinds of peppers: sliced jalapeños, whole pepperoncinis, and tiny whole mexihots that are full of heat and make you sweat. Those little addictive add-ons are awesome!\n\nThe menu is a bit more expanded than a typical burger chain too since they have a Santa Barbara Burger (Sourdough plus avocado...really fantastic!) and also things like chicken sandwiches, Ahi tuna sandwich, Tri-tip sandwich, and a veggie burger(!) which almost seems blasphemous at a burger joint. No one around me ordered those things so I can't really vouch for any of them. And seriously, if you come to The Habit and order a veggie burger you probably deserve to be choked out and put in the back dumpster while waiting for your order. \n\nDon't miss this little gem of a burger stand if you are in the area. There is a small parking lot in the rear which is a pro tip recommendation as parking is tough to find on the street. And don't miss those hot peppers. Nothing completes the foodie look more than to have rivulets of sweat and burger juice running down your face while seated under the awning of a 1969 original.",

  "text": "I want to preface this review that I lived here for two years, from 2010-2012. I only know of how Lenox was up until May 2012 & that things may have changed for the better, or for the worse. \n\nI lived in a two bedroom, two bath, patio unit that listed for \"$1,400\" but the new move-in special was $1,035. A great deal for a brand new unit. The unit itself had a stack washer & dryer, large kitchen appliances & huge closets. When I mean, huge, I mean HUGE. I'd almost wished the closets were a little smaller & the bedrooms themselves were larger. The master bath had a large, oval tub/shower. The laminate hard wood floor in the kitchen was nice but it showed foot prints very easily. Overall, I enjoyed the unit, even if the patio overlooked the parking garage. \n\nTo enter the residential part of the building, you must use a RFID card or use the phone directory to look up the resident & then call their number & they can buzz you in. I enjoyed this system & I always felt safe. Each entrance door had a camera on it. \n\nA few things I did not like about Lenox Village was the people with pets, mainly dogs. I love animals, I've got two cats myself. However, I don't like when people take their dog to the stairwell & let the animal pee all over the place. My last year at Lenox, there was an issue with people bring their dogs to the stairwell and letting them do their business. Management knew about it & put up signs that pretty much said whoever snitched on the culprit would get a gift card or something. \n\nI wanted to put a camera up in the stairwell but that would cost a lot & would require some effort, so instead, I would just bitch about it every time I'd use the stairs. Why not use the elevator, you ask? Well it usually was on the opposite floor & I was only going up or down two flights of stairs, \"Keep Moving\" as the First Lady says. \n\nThe trash room with the trash chute always was a mess & smelled. I don't know if people just carried their trash in their hands & threw it on the floor for a reason or what. I put my trash in a bag, tie the top & put it down the chute. \n\nEach apartment gets one (1) numbered, reserved parking spot. One (1), not two (2). This usually wasn't an issue, as there was two levels of \"two hour parking\" that was never monitored. I saw one car parked in the same \"two hour parking\" spot for months & nothing happened. \n\nAs you're probably aware, the apartments are over different businesses. Our unit was over top of a sports bar. The patrons of the bar weren't loud, it was the employees that, like clockwork, every night at 1am would LOUDLY dump glass beer bottles into a metal trash can. I think they did it one at a time. At least I knew when I woke up from a sound sleep that it was 1am. \n\nLastly, the reason we moved from Lenox was that every year the price would go up. Not by a few bucks but by a hundred. The first year was $1,035. The next year it raised to $1,125. The third year they wanted to raise it to $1,250. I understand that Lenox Village & RAM Partners (the company that owns Lenox) needs to make money, but I kind of feel that it's a slap in the face to keep charging more & more each year to people who are living in the unit, making you money. \n\nThey ask for 2 months notice of you're going to renew or not, we told them no & they didn't seem to care. I would think it would matter to them however, because in the months leading up to us moving out, they were running promotions that if you got someone to move in you would get a referral. I was in the area around 4 months after we moved & noticed the unit was empty through the windows visible from the parking garage. \n\nOverall, I give the Lenox Village town center apartments 4 stars. That 4 star rating is at the $1,035 price. I would give it a 3 if it was the $1,250 price & I probably wouldn't live there for $1,400 a month.",

  "text": "We had lunch on Fat Tuesday at Baileys' Range and were totally surprised. I have drug my feet coming here due to the mixed reviews and now regret that I didn't come sooner.  Not only did BR amaze us with burgers, but their wings, chili and fries were equally as good. \n\nOur feast at Bailey's begun with Smoked Pablano Chicken Wings and a Cup of Chili. We enjoyed the wings, they provided a different twist to the traditional \"hot\" wings and the chili was kick ass. The chili had a spice that provided a good kick that we could not name, but loved it just the same. It was topped with melted cheese and croutons. Croutons are a nice upgrade from oyster crackers and add an additional flavor. \n\nTo test a new burger restaurant, we figured it was best to try the \"basic\" burger. If they can not do a basic burger, how will they be able to do the \"specialty\" burgers. They nailed it! Our burgers were juicy, cooked to our specifications and served with all the toppings. Bailey's doesn't stop at a good burger, they put it on a house made bun, that can rival some bakery buns. \n\nWe shared a small order of fries and I can tell you a small is enough to satisfy two. Their fries are house cut, no frozen pre-cut fries at BR. As our sauce we choose \"crazy catsup\", which I wish could be bought to take home. I love the way they serve their catsup, in the small mason jars. I recently have become a big fan of places that provide catsup in small cups instead of nasty bottles. \n\nA visit to Bailey's Range would not be complete without having a shake. Again, we went with the a traditional shake instead of one their now famous \"boozy shakes\". \nI had my favorite flavor, strawberry and Brad got creative and mixed vanilla ice cream with blueberry sorbet. They said, they have not had anyone mix ice cream and sorbet before. His creation was fantastic, he joked that he is glad we do not live in a loft downtown, because he would have one everyday. The shakes were better then a specialty parlor down on Locust. \n\nOur waitress was friendly and provided great service. I will be honest, the reason they did not get a five is fault of the kitchen. All the food was excellent, but we had just received our wings and chili when another server approached with our burgers. Next time, we will hold back and not order burgers until we are finished enjoying our appetizers. However, they took ownership of the error and without complaining they made it right by treating us to our shakes and removing them from our bill. \n\nBailey's Range, I'll be back. You gave me good service, good food and I like that your carryout vessels are eco-friendly.",

  "text": "Five Guys is the chain that started my quest for the best burger in St. Louis.  It's not really a quest so much as a compulsive need to order burgers wherever I go to find one that could potentially beat the Five Guys burger experience.  \n\nMy first encounter with Five Guys was at their Town and Country location.  I fell in love and couldn't have been happier to find new locations in St. Charles and Florissant, which seem to be my stomping grounds between work and home.  \n\nJust a few tips for folks new to the Five Guys Experience:\n\nThe fries are cooked in peanut oil, so take your Epipen if you have allergies.  Note, I did not say avoid at all costs, just take the damn Epipen!  (it's worth it, I promise!)  \n\nThe menu isn't clear enough for some people.  If you order a regular burger, expect to get a huge burger with 2 patties and all your toppings.  If you are a light weight, order the Little Burger.  You will get one patty instead of two.\n\nLast but not least, order the regular fries.  A large fry here is ridiculous, and is more than enough for two or even three people.  The regular order will get you a cup of fries in your bag, and then another cup dumped on top of your order.  It's not a joke.  They dump them right in the bag once everything else is in there.\n\nThe last tip is to eat slowly.  Those fries will be hot!",

I like my goodies spicy!  \n\nSo I have my goods in a bowl, put it on the counter near the window so Mr. Chef can throw the ingredients onto his holy canvas.  He works his magic and voila!  I'm ready to go to town.  \n\nNever have I been disappointed with Mongolian BBQ.  I've tried their buffet items and they are disgusting.  Don't waste your time filling your plate with food that has been sitting under a heat lamp, find true love over on the Mongolian BBQ side.",

I met up with a small group of friends for lunch here.\n\nWe sat down, got our drinks and food ordered and we're chatting away and our nice waiter gives us each a shot of basil tomato soup to try!  They were so cute!  The soup was very good and we appreciated the taste.\n\nLet me tell you, the garlic, Parmesan french fries are simply perfect!  I love cheese fries in general but Boucherie takes these fries to another level.  I couldn't stop eating them.  We had ordered a small plate of them as an appetizer and I was ecstatic to know that my husband got the beef brisket which came with more fries as a side!\n\nI got the potato pierogies with greens and caramelized onions and they were really tasty.  Very nicely cooked and pierogies went really well with the onions.  \n\nI couldn't help but steal my husband's fries.  I traded him a pierogi for a piece of brisket and that was very nicely cooked as well!  Very tender and the sauce was brilliant.\n\nSo to be honest, I would come back here for the garlic, Parmesan fries and I would be perfectly happy.  OH!  I almost forgot to mention for dessert we got the bacon brownie!  That was also amazing.  Moist and soft chocolate brownie with a hint of bacon which also came a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  \n\nI highly recommend this place.",

Shot girls, over-priced drinks, bands combing the crowd for more tips and getting in your face when you refuse, shitty bartenders, and a sea of douchebags - if you love these things, this is your spot! I went here the other night for what was supposed to be a closing party for a comedy festival. We were supposed to get the upstairs blocked off for VIPs and we had assumed some drink specials had been worked out for us. Miscommunication..blah, blah, blah...this didn't happen. I don't really hold that against them. I hold $10 small well drinks against you. I hold $15 huge cups of well drinks where you pour booze on top so that your customers will smell it and think that there drink is not just a plastic cup of Coke against you. I hold the fact that your bartender refused to give me my change in the hopes that I would get frustrated and leave all of it as tip against you. But that's cool; if the kids from Sheboygan are willing to put up with that kind of nonsense, play on player. I'll be around the corner paying $5 for a real drink with no attitude or weird syringe things in my peripheral.  Oh but 2 for 1 beers (total=$7.00), except Bud Light, cuz that shit is like Cristal!",

She ate at Chipotle's a lot during her college days in S.C. where fast food is so much \"better\" than in NOLA. See Five Guys. So we met for lunch on a 90 degree day on that lovely stretch of Clearview Pkwy that was so much more scenic when it was a cow pasture, ie, Elmwood, the Concrete Jungle. She walked me through the Felipeesque process of making my \"bowl.\"  I was impressed by the fresh ingredients which is apparently the Chipotle food mission. You can make fast food that is healthy and tasty. And tasty it was. Not knock your socks off tasty, but tasty nonetheless. My \"bowl\" (which is a burrito with no tortilla) had something like brown rice (flavored with lime and cilantro), black beans, pulled pork, cheese and some sort of salsa. It was a pretty good and healthy dish and beats a double whopper with cheese on both the disgust and bloat factor. \n\nAs for the decor, I can't say I'm a fan. They are trying not to look fast food so basically have designed an interior with stainless steel bar seating which is somewhat communal, very trendy. See Mariza. It is an improvement over the orange and yellow formica at most FF places, but, frankly, I thought the tables would have been perfect for a morgue, easy to clean etc. \n\nBut regardless of the morbid decor, I will go back....and maybe get it to go.\n\nPS I'm not checking off \"Romantic\" on the additional tips section.",

  "text": "I feel a little guilty giving this place 3 stars when everyone seems to love it so much, but oh well!\n\nSo, to begin, we managed to find parking quite easily in the underground parking garage. We actually found a spot right next to the elevator that took us up to the entrance of the museum, so that was a good start to our visit! Parking would have been quite expensive for the garage, but the museum validated our ticket so that we could leave the garage for free - another plus :) On the negative side, I thought the admission tickets for the museum were kind of pricy: $15 for an adult ticket? Not outrageous, but a bit more than I expected for a pretty small museum.\n\nAnyway, we paid for our tickets and began our visit with the \"Reel West\" special exhibit. This could be a generational thing (I'm in my early 30s), but I thought this exhibit was super boring. It seems like this exhibit, which includes various mementos and outfits from old Westerns, would be interesting to older people that grew up watching the relevant TV shows and movies, but it was not interesting to me at all. Maybe just an issue of personal taste, though.\n\nOur next room contained some really nice paintings of Western landscapes and Native Americans as well as a few interesting sculptures, so that improved my mood quite a bit. Unfortunately, the neighboring room was under construction or something, so we likely missed out on some other good pieces.\n\nWe then went down to the lower level of the museum, but it didn't seem to contain anything interesting, so we journeyed up to the top (and final) floor of the museum. There was definitely a lot of content up there, so I'm glad we checked it out! First, there were at least a couple of rooms dedicated to one particular Native American artist - unfortunately, I was not a huge fan of his work. Some of it was pretty good (the abstract paintings, for example), but a lot of his work consisted of poorly drawn coyotes. I'm not trying to be a jerk, and it's possible that the true meaning of his work just flew right over my head, but that was my interpretation of what I saw :) So many pictures of coyotes!\n\nThe remaining part of the museum contained a lot of artifacts and objects created by different Native American tribes. That part was pretty interesting as well, although I tend to prefer paintings over artifacts/objects, so I wasn't super captivated. After finishing up with the actual exhibits, we checked out the gift shop, and while we didn't buy anything, it had a pretty good selection of stuff to purchase.\n\nOverall, I can't imagine I'd ever come back here. I am interested in Native American and old Western culture, but only as much as I'm interested in most other things, and there are lots of other museums to check out in the world. That being said, if you're particularly fascinated by the themes explored by the work in this museum, then I definitely recommend you go, as there's a good amount of content and some of it is pretty cool!",

Many a Phillies' game I have stopped by on the way home, and they didn't even get angry with my repeat attempts to steal their one-ton (must be the wieght if I can't lift it) cigar Indian statue; for some reason their beer always makes me feel powerful enough to throw it onto my shoulder and walk home up the hill.

Everyone's friendly there, bar dog included, even when I occasionally return to pay tabs I forgot the night before (and especially when I return to pay tabs I thought I forgot, but actually did not). Great bar to go chill in any night of the week, or at least to jump start your night on Main st.\n\n***they do 6 packs to go!***",

  "text": "I don't know what it is about Grille 39 but I think it is one of Carmel's best kept secrets.  Since discovering it when I was pregnant nearly 6 years ago, the consistency alone in it's above average food at good prices continues to bring me back!  \n\nMy girlfriends and I used to partake in martini Mondays here...since, we go back for a glass of wine and a salad or just for dessert (the apple crisp - don't miss it).  It's always very good and the service is also excellent.  It's NEVER busy it seems, even on weekends when the Renaissance is full!\n\nMost recently, however, we ended up here again b/c my sister was turning 30 and 17 of her closest friends came into town to share a meal with her.  Unfortunately Kona and Cooper's Hawk could not accommodate us (at all or if they could, there was a room fee - silly).  Grille 39 not only had no issue accommodating in a semi-private area, they offered us a VERY affordable menu to choose from.  For $25/pp we were able to choose a three course meal off a pre-set menu.  The choices were extremely appetizing and they assured us service would be smooth and stressfree.\n\nThey were 100% correct.  Everyone seemed to devour their meals and I especially LOVED my salmon. The portions were perfect, the food was cooked well and the service ran extremely smooth.  We had two wonderful servers who filled drinks, cleaned up one of my messes (spilled water glass) and were always around to clean up plates.  It went very well!  Then dessert came out and other than the brownie, which was hard and ....tasteless, everyone seemed very happy.  I was disappointed in the brownie that I tasted off someone else's plate, but honestly that is the ONLY complaint.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this place if you have a larger group and need space, want something more private and intimate for a date night and/or a quiet place to grab a drink and have a real conversation.  It never seems crowded and there is always good food/drinks to be had. For a restaurant in a hotel, it really could not be any better!",

  "text": "Another great meal at a Cunningham Restaurant. My husband and I went tonight for our 40th anniversary. After we were seated Ronda the manager came and explained the menu and suggested a few cocktails. I had the Mezcal with the ginger beer, it had a bit of a smoky  taste to it, loved it, hubby had Modelo beer. Next we  had the grilled artichokes it was so flavorful and tender.\nHubby had the Red Drum fish and he loved it. I had the corn empanadas which were good but next time I would get them as an appetizer and try the pork tamales.\nFor dessert we ordered the churros and Crystal also brought us a plate of dessert with \"Happy Anniversary \" on it, very nice presentation and delicious. \nIt was our waitress Crystal first day off training and you would never have known.\nShe did a fantastic job friendly, personable and a great smile.\nAfter we left the restaurant I found out one of my daughters that lives out of town wanted to pay for the dessert plate,  whoever she talked to said, \"absolutely not\". It was on the house....great experience and look forward in going back. Yes, the parking is $8 but worth it since parking is at a premium and my husband can't walk very far. Valet was so sweet and personable as well....",

Some of the local rescue groups and shelters smartly partner with pet stores to accommodate adoptions. While I got to meet and fall in love with Oscar at his foster home, the actual adoption took place here, where his foster mom volunteers on weekends.\n\nThe actual process took only a few minutes as we went through his paperwork. As we were doing that, Oliver was playing with buddies and looking quite adorable - other folks stopped by and expressed interest in him and I was happy to let them know he was going home with me.\n\nPetco provides new adopters some great coupons for immediate needs such as kitty litter, carriers, pet food and collars.

The food is a stand out 5 stars, absolutely outstanding- but our service was 2 star! \nWe had a reservation and arrived early so we planned to have a drink at the bar. They don't have bar to sit at other than one that overlooks the pizza oven. The staff at the pizza oven was so friendly. I was really disappointed they only serve beer and wine. They offer no liquor and no ciders, and their rosè or champagne is only sold by the bottle, which was really a bummer. A few of us only had cokes because there wasn't something we liked on the menu.\nOur server wasn't friendly at all. She cut off people asking questions, and repeatedly said she'd discuss the specials when the whole group arrived but she never did. Later, we realized that someone in the party would have ordered something from the specials menu. It was difficult to get her attention when people wanted to order another beer, or bottle of wine. She walked away from the table after two people put in appetizer orders, not giving others the chance to order. She also seemed outwardly annoyed if someone asked a question she already answered.\nI had the Pollo Valentino and it was absolutely amazing. I had called ahead and they confirmed that they can make any of the pasta dishes gluten free. I ordered this as gluten free and it was better than I could've imagined. The pasta was cooked to perfection and the sauce was a perfect balance of flavor and creaminess. The chicken was well seasoned and grilled perfectly. My husband tried this and agreed that it was absolutely amazing. He was jealous he hadn't ordered this.\nMy husband had the pizze formaggi, made fresh in the pizza oven. It was made to perfection and he loved every bite!\n-the salad that comes with the meals was very average.-\nOur party ordered a couple of desserts and the only one that I didn't care for was the crème brûlée because it was more like a pudding and the tip wasn't fired to be crispy.\nI will give it another try because as I said, the food was outstanding.",

My husband loves this place for their wings and pizza. Both are excellent. The deep dish pizza is fantastic and incredibly filling, so order less than you think you'll need. Great beer selection, pretty good service. The only thing that keeps us from going here more often is the lack of a host. The whole place is open seating like a bar usually would be, but this place is huge so it seems to me there should be some kind of organization. When we drive by, if the lot is full and we're really hungry, we usually go elsewhere. But if you have time to stare down fellow diners to steal their table when they're done, it's worth it.",

When I went to New Orleans in April, I knew I had to visit this sweet spot!\n\nIt's located on Magazine Street in the Garden District, alongside the other shops and cafes. Sucré has a lovely sign outside that reads, \"Life is uncertain. Eat dessert first.\" How true, how true?!\n\nSo many sweets, so little time. It's like being a kid in a candy shop... literally! The sweets are arranged in glass displays and they have a large menu with pricing. There's plenty of seating in the shop so you can enjoy a hot beverage with your dessert.\n\nI bought a box of macarons to bring back home and they were carefully wrapped to survive the walk, bus, and air plane ride home. Macarons are fragile, but these made it mostly intact to NJ.\n\nSucré is one of my favorite sweet spots in NOLA and when I'm back, I'll be heading there!",

I think because it blends in with so much on 4th Ave that it just sort of becomes a wash.\n\nToday, however, TTS was a standout success. I ventured out this morning for one thing and one thing only, a really ugly holiday sweater for Yelp Tucson's first Elite Event at the Abbey. http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-abbey-eat-drink-tucson. I struck out at a few places, and then knocked it out of the park here. There were two ginormous racks of holiday sweaters, literally jumping off hangers and into my arms! It was hard to choose, but I wound up with a delightful zip-up cardigan with snowmen and snowflakes that I would actually consider wearing in more normal circumstances. \n\nEven better than my sweater was the accessory I scored. I'd love to talk about it, but I'm afraid some Elites might read this review and I'll have spoiled my Ho Ho Ho surprise. I'll get a photo up of the ensemble so you can truly appreciate the joy I have for rediscovering a Tucson mainstay. Oh and the staff there is super friendly and really informative. When I was going back and forth between two picks, the cashier was helpful in leading me to a festive decision!",

I could tell some people were still being trained but even they were polite and speedy. This restaurant is adorable. The artwork on the back wall is cheery and very pretty. I love the gold chairs. I love the benches. It's a great look. You walk in, order and then find a seat which seems to keep things speedy. I ordered the hand pie and it was absolutely delicious. I devoured it. In about 2 minutes. I even wanted to finish the gravy with a spoon. Which leads me to the bad side . . . \n\nBad side: The portion was so small. They were so good but I finished lunch super quickly and was still hungry. For the price, I expected a little more food. I ended up getting a croissant on my way out because I was still so hungry. The croissant was flakey and delicious but that plus my lunch was kind of pricey. It was good but this is going to be more of a \"special occasion\" lunch spot rather than a quick everyday lunch spot.",

  "text": "Oh, the Longwood Gardens.\n\nI've been coming here every few years since I was a little girl, and I love it more and more every time, because I come to appreciate it more and more whenever I have the opportunity to visit.\n\nOf course, it's gorgeous. So much work was put into the design of the Gardens, and so much work is put into maintaining it every day. This year, they seemed to be kind of promoting that behind-the-scenes work in their introduction video when you first enter. The children's garden is so cute and fun, the water lilies are absolutely beautiful. I loved the entire room dedicated to the Victoria lily, which is an amazing flower. (It's also a great place to escape to find some air conditioning ;) )\n\nThe fountain shows are great. I think some people felt underwhelmed but honestly, I think that they have really high expectations as far as how in-sync the fountains go with the John Philip Sousa playing. The EVENING fountain show was seriously spectacular, though. It's a 30-minute show that starts at... 9:15 PM? The fountains are lit underneath, there are some amazing beautiful colors, and it's a really nice way to end a day at the Gardens. (Or you can come back if you arrived early in the day.)\n\nI also really liked visiting Pierre du Pont's house. I'm the kind of nerd who really loves learning about history, so getting to see his home, his vision, and what he physically did to even the house was really great. He had such a great vision for what he wanted the Gardens to be like, and he poured so much of himself into making that vision a reality that people still enjoy today.\n\nI wholeheartedly 100% recommend the Gardens to anyone who likes flowers, plants, horticulture, biology, the outdoors, people-watching, fountains, John Philip Sousa, topiary, and more.",

A tad hipsta but what great brunch place isn't nowadays?\n\nWe needed 3 things: carb items for my daughter, eggs and sausage for my son, area proximity due to party proceeding...ok maybe four...bloody marys...always a requirement.\n\nWe were greeted with smiles and the wait was nothing (5 mins) compared to other brunch places. Albeit this is a bar but the brunch game is strong my friends.\n\nI definitely recommend getting the Bloody Mary. It's spicy and garnished with homemade pickled veggies. Your choice of vodka.\n\nWe ordered a chocolate, caramel donut for the table to try because it was $2 and it was ridiculous. Hot out of the fryer made it crunchy on the outside with a cakey inside and whatever goodness they garnished with was off the plate and devoured within seconds.\n\nKiddos ordered the chocolate chip pancakes  as well as eggs and sausage. The portions are enormous. The toasted sourdough that comes with egg dishes is superb and you can order as a side. The pile of seasoned fries are a crispy nice addition instead of home fries.\n\nThe stunner is the chicken french toast with sunny eggs, kale and cabbage slaw, and peppered maple syrup. The combination of the crunchy kale and cabbage slaw and the saltiness of the fried chicken coupled with the gooey sunnies and peppery sweet maple syrup was insane. I will go back for that lovely dish.\n\nOverall I was really impressed and would recommend!!",

Best nachos I've had around this area, and I am a frequent flyer. Then I had the ceviche mixto, which was a 12 out of 10, dude. I've never had ceviche that had salmon in it (think like sushi-grade, very fresh) and it was a pleasant surprise. It comes with a huge bowl of tortilla chips which I couldn't finish--thanks to the nacho app--but I also paired it with a side of sweet plantains, which made my meal entirely too much. But the plantains were cooked to perfection, topped with crema and this delicious honey and chipotle-y sauce? phewwww man. I could've drank it, lemme tell ya. I will be back!",

First off, I must say, this is a case of a fine restaurant being located in a rather tired-looking strip mall.  Don't let the outside turn you away. It's a lovely little restaurant with a comfortable and relaxing atmosphere with friendly service.\n\nIf I may, I'd like to quote some of my friends on their first meal here for we ordered a nice variety of dishes. I might add the menu was very extensive and offered good vegetarian choices as well.\n\"The food was delicious and I found the service to be efficient and very friendly.  I also liked the tasteful decor and ambiance.  We tasted many items and I found them all to be very good.\"\n\"The restaurant was clean and pleasant, not crowded but well frequented. The food was plentiful and interesting.  My dish was more spicy than expected but had large pieces of chicken and rice that was aromatic and flavorful, although spicy.\"\nChefs Special Combination Mixed Grill: \"The service was excellent and very attentive. Though the dish had great flavor it was overcooked. The lamb was way over done and dry. I loved that they had real ice tea, and lots of lemon! The naan flat breads: we had onion, garlic and plain. They were tender, flavorful, and melt-in-the-mouth delicious. All the appetizers we tried were fantastic.\"\nI had the Vegetable Biryani with flavored basmati rice with veggies, nuts, and cashews. It was pretty bland as I ordered it. Should have spiced it up a bit more.\n\nHere's a link to their website with all the food they serve: http://sher-e-punjabtucson.com\n\nSeveral of us remarked upon leaving that it would wonderful to return for their famous lunch buffet. I look forward to that.",

  "text": "I guess the point of Groupon is to encourage you to try new places you haven't heard of before. And to make money, I guess. But that's how I discovered Judge's. I was skeptical at first, but according to the interwebs, it had won tons of BBQ awards. Due to its incredibly limited hours (how are they not open on the weekend?!), I could only make it there for the Friday buffet. But I was pleasantly surprised!\n\nIt's in a nondescript building on a nondescript street, but the inside is very nice! Comfortable and traditional. The buffet confused me at first - it looked like I was walking in on a church group's potluck. But maybe that's the charm of Judge's. My boyfriend and I tried everything. It all was amazing, but I went back for seconds (and maybe thirds....) of the rib tips - they were so tender and meaty. There were a few different desserts, but I loved the chocolate cake. I think it was just made from a box of cake mix, but it was so good! It seemed like someone at the restaurant had lovingly made it, like my mom would for my birthday.\n\nAnd wouldn't you know it, the Judge himself stopped by. Or at least, a guy who looked just like the logo. I'm kidding, it was him, and honestly, it felt pretty special to meet the Judge after we had enjoyed the awesome BBQ at his restaurant.",

  "text": "I shared three starters with my date. We had the pot roast cheese fries which was very good. The pot roast was very tender and the flavor gave the fries an extra kick. The cheese wasn't too heavy and that made my day. The buffalo chicken rolls were also very good and the blue cheese sauce was unexpectedly good, since I'm not a fan of dipping sauces very often. It tasted fresh and not like something you get out of a packaged container. Last were the stacked chicken quesadillas. They were really good and had a nice balance of chicken cheese and veggies. \n\nFor a meal I had the shrimp scampi which I grade a B. It was good but I wasn't too keen on taking the left overs home. The sauce was on the bottom, so I had to move the noodles around a lot to get to it. \n\nI had a Proseco which was nicely chilled and good on the palette. My date had a Grand Mimosa which was made with sparkling wine rather than champagne which she didn't like. She thought it would have been better with champagne because mimosas are typically done with champagne. I enjoyed the flavor because I love Grand Marnier, but I thought the drink could have been colder. It was somewhere in between cool and warm. \n\nService was professional and the waitress wasn't bothersome. Our food came out promptly and our orders were correct. The layout of the location was nice, good for a romantic evening or for a quick stop in and have a drink and go. All in all I had a great time and would recommend this Grand Lux. Will definitely go again for the bread pudding that we had for dessert.",

Since I don't identify as upper-class, I frequently forget to venture in even though they have some great sales and many of my favorite brands. it's easy to go elsewhere for Citizens of Humanity jeans, but no one else has quite the selection of Gucci bags (I own neither of these things, I'm just trying to appeal to a wider audience, you know?). I stop in here because they have a Tiffany & Co. store inside which is where I go to get my pieces repaired or polished. They also have a Louis Vuitton if you're into that sort of thing. My most recent tour in here I fell in love with one-thousand things I can't afford, and walked out empty handed. Maybe someday when I am a rich lady, Holt & I will become better acquainted.",

  "text": "I've always enjoyed the Nashville Farmer's Market, even as all the old interior businesses were torn down, and new ones (and some of the same, yet renovated ones) appeared.  I thought by moving from north of Nashville into town I'd do most of my regular shopping at the Farmer's Market.  Ehh, not so...\n\nSo I don't make it here too often, but it's great when I do.  Mostly because I LOVE the Indian (and general Asian) market.  Huge bags of lentils, other grains and spices, for so little $.  I can dig.  I'd like to adopt an entirely Indian diet just so I can shop here.  \n\nThe actual farmer's \"row\" is pretty good, too.  Sure, the bananas aren't Nashville grown... But the peaches are Georgia of South Carolina grown.  I've had great, very fresh experiences with the produce purchased here. (And a bad experience with the frozen goat meat purchased here.  Moving on...)\n\nJamaica Way inside is an awesome eating experience every time.  The Indian place is good too, if I recall.  I haven't had experience with any of the BBQ or southern cookin' places, because it's hard to drag me away from the previously mentioned...\n\nI'd save a lot of money and improve my health by a landslide if I shopped exclusively at the Nashville Farmer's Market, and purchased produce that was ONLY in season.",

We received a friendly greeting upon entering. Order at the counter and food is delivered. I ordered the falafel salad and asked for some Kalamata olives to be added. The falafel was good but far from the best I've had but I was disappointed that the lettuce was iceberg; I had anticipated romaine as I would expect on a Greek salad. The pita bread was warm but again, I have had better. Husband, however, enjoyed his lamb bowl. It sounded like there was a bit of a commotion in the kitchen; perhaps that is why there is a help wanted sign.",

  "text": "I'll admit it. We saw The Avengers movie, and Robert Downey Junior's quip and the post-credit scene gave us a craving for shawarma. So we searched high and low for pita-wrapped meaty goodness (specific rules: it had to specifically be called \"shawarma\" on the menu; no gyros nor kebabs here!)... and found the best shawarma of our lives.\n\nSeriously.\n\nThe only menu item specifically called shawarma is chicken shawarma... and it's beautifully flavored. The meat roasts on a spit in plain view, and is super juicy and tender. They give you the WHOLE pita here (as opposed to the half-pita sandwich you might find at other places), so it's super filling The distribution of layers of vegetables, sauce, and meat is perfectly arranged so you get a bit of each in each individual bite.\n\nOh man, we could rave about the self-serve sauce bar, but I'll try not to gush. It includes a variety of pickles, harissa, some kind of sweet tamarind sauce, a green somewhat spicy cilantro sauce, and a variety of olives. I can't believe all that is free! Make sure to give it a look, at least.\n\nI'd love to come back to Desert Rose to try their other offerings. The prices are decent, the portions are huge, and they also have a little shelf of Mediterranean groceries for purchase (check out their interesting salts!). It's obvious that the head chef and employees care deeply about this new business, and I hope that the rest of the community will, too.",

  "text": "My first attempt at St. Louis BBQ was more than two years ago when I went to Pappy's as an eager freshman and waited 1.5 hours for a pretty average pulled pork sandwich. Granted, maybe I did not order the best bbq item on the menu, but it pretty much deterred me from trying other St. Louis bbq since Pappy's is considered the \"best in STL\".\n\nA couple months ago I was introduced to Sugarfire when i went with a group of interns - it was a life-changing experience. The line was about 10x faster than Pappy's, and everyone serving me was friendly and helpful. I ordered the beef brisket sandwich with a side of veggies the first time, and it was so damn good. The beef brisket is so tender, and I enjoyed trying the different bbq sauces, but STL bbq sauce is my favorite by far. \n\nI have tried basically all the meats at Sugarfire after 2 visits to this location and 2 to the O'Fallon location. The beef brisket and smoked turkey are my favorite. They are both very tender, flavorful, and not too heavy. I am not a huge fan of pork, but I think the ribs and pulled pork are average. The sides tend to be on the salty side, especially if they are veggies, but they are pretty flavorful. I have also tried the salmon and its pretty good if you're looking for an alternative to meat! \n\nHowever, if you want a ton of meat, go for the meat daddy, which has generous portions of ribs, pulled pork, beef brisket, smoked turkey, and a sausage with two sides and a drink. I had the meat daddy the last time with baked beans and green beans and split it with my girlfriend. It was literally so much food, we definitely shouldn't have tried to finish it all. It's good though if you want to sample the meats and it's a lot of food for $23!\n\nI love Sugarfire, and I just keep coming back for that delicious STL BBQ.",

We just sat wherever we wanted.\n\nThere is a long staircase right by the entrance and I was very tempted to use it. It's also very dimly lit pass the dining room and the bar. I was almost reluctant to use the bathroom in the back. I love that feeling.\n\nThe waitress/bartender recommended these new drinks she was mixing up so four of us each had one. The other two were staying away from alcohol. Let me tell you something, their corn bread with syrup (probably family recipe) was the best thing I've ever had. We devoured it in 2 minutes. I love sweets before the meal.\n\nWe proceed to order our entrees. Everything was fried, it seems like; except the salads. The pork chop was pretty. Two of ordered the jambalaya with deep fried catfish strips. The rice was a bowl's worth but it was surrounded by fish. It was battered pretty thickly so it was a lot to eat. We stripped the fried crunchy stuff and ate most of the fish. \n\nDisappointed that this wasn't a vampire house, I left happy and full stomached.",

Ya know, to compare them all.\n\nSo far, of the three I've tried, I've liked Mia's the best\n\nWhy, you ask? Easy - 3 reasons.\n\nFirst and foremost, cleanliness. While I've only been there once, it was clear to see that Mia's sanitizes their tools regularly. In fact, I saw at least 4 sterilizers behind the manicure stations, and I saw my manicurist take the tools she'd be using straight out of her sterilizer and open the sealed package. \n\nSecond, their color selection for gel polish was excellent, and the manicurist was very patient as I struggled worth indecision! So many choices! Eek!\n\nThird, my manicurist, May, was so patient and gentle while also being very thorough. Unlike some manicurists at other salons I've visited, May did not attack my nails with a vengeance, stabbing and cutting like a mad lady. Rather, she worked efficiently and gently, paying close attention to detail. When I clumsily bumped my nails when putting them under the lights to cure the gel...not once but TWICE...she patiently and kindly fixed them without losing her patience or complaining. \n\nSuprise! I thought of a fourth reason I really liked Mia's - they did not rush their work on me to get to the next client.  It was lovely. \n\nIn short, I'll be back!",

For our main dishes, I went with the Mac and cheese topped with hot chicken (they had two options- their house which was a medium Buffalo or Nashville hot) & he went with the mushroom blue burger.

I have heard  good things about the Fried Egg BSRP which is what i ordered...minus the B (B is for bacon). I feel that you always take a gamble when ordering a dish sans ingredients because they were usually put there for a reason. But, that sandwich just seemed too good to pass up, so i threw caution to the wind and went with it! So glad i did, because it was SUPER. I got a side salad with it, which i didn't really eat. It was not bad, but i eat salad all the time and i was really just regretting not getting chips. Note to self - get chips fool!\n\nOkay, so now for the best part of my lunch. COCKTAILS! Nosh makes a mean one. Seriously, one of the best i have ever had. I had a cucumber martini and it was PERFECT. Refreshing, slightly sweet but not overly so. This would be the most amazing summer drink ever. My friend had a hard lemonade and it was equally delicious. \n\nI can't wait to go back and try Nosh again but first impression is good.

The unusual building structure seemed perfect for a public library. I would love to sit at one of the small tables and just get lost in a book. The whole place makes me feel very nostalgic, as if I've been here before. I love that feeling. \n\nNow, some negatives. The books are not easy to find. it seemed the selection was rather small, but it could well be because of their huge shelf areas. I also learned just now that they close two days a week (Fri/Sat? Really?) and close early in eve. I know I am spoiled locally in Marin, where the public libraries are just amazing, but that's a bit sad. \nAlso, no parking. We were able to just park on the street, but this would be inconvenient for families with little kids, disabled users, and in bad weathers.

I was so in love with the dish that I ordered it a second time.  That was a mistake.  It had to have been a different cheft that night.  There was wayyyyyy to much goat cheese in the risotto to the point that it had a grainy texture and caused you to pull strings of cheese.  The poor pork belly was so over cooked it was hard to cut with a knife and barely had flavor and the sea scallops while okay didn't have that great color developed.  This place can be great.

Our server just seemed busy and not the friendliest. Overall a solid pizza spot though.",

It led me to trying a bunch of different beers that I normally wouldn't try to do because I wouldn't want to try a normal sized pint.  The prices are by the ounce and are pretty decently priced. The manager was very nice and asked us what we liked me didn't like. They are really open to suggestions. \n\nPlus.. they had Abita on draft and the Nola girl in me fell in love with an Indy bar with Abita",

It has a great cozy upscale feel with wonderful food. \n\nWe both started with some tasty bubbly cocktails. If you love some bubbly than this is the place for you. They have plenty of options. We then split the grilled quail with wilted arugala and a sherry au jus and it was lovely. Yes, quail is always tough to eat because it's just so tiny but the flavors were really tasty. It was a very fall dish. My only wish was that the quail came with more of a grilled texture but all and all, great start. I should also mention that the bread and butter was awesome. I loooove a french baguette and they serve a great one!\n\nFor our entrees we went with the seared duck breast and the butter poached salmon. The duck was perfect. I love a seared duck breast and this dish had every component I love in a duck dish. Perfectly medium rare, sweet and savory with a creamy puree to pair. Great. Very rich but well worth the richness! The salmon was also a winner. It was more on the rare side which is fine by me with the perfect buttery flavor. The other components all paired well with the dish and didn't take anything away from the salmon. \n\nWith the cold winter months upon us, absolutely check this place out!",

  "text": "I have many memories of Plaza Bowl from my childhood - birthdays, school trips. I think my mom was even in a league there for a while. I've always thought of it fondly but hadn't been back in many, many years. The one time I did attempt to go recently, they were closed! I went for dinner nearby last night and actually parked right outside. After our meal, hoping there weren't leagues in there, we decided to head down and see if we could knock some pins over. \n\nI felt like I stepped through a time machine and came out in 1993. Absolutely nothing has changed and I love it. There are 12 lanes, but they're not all in a row like other bowling alleys. There are six on each side of the room. The wooden benches remind me of old church pews. The bowling alley is in a basement, yet there are curtains all along the walls. I swear the lady working at the front is the same one from way back when, too. \n\nThe price for a game is cheaper than other alleys - $4.50/game. Shoe rentals are $2.00. You can get a few snacks - chips and beer. The lady told me they usually close between 9:30-10pm.\n\nThere are leagues every night except Thursday night. We went on Wednesday shortly before 7pm and the teams started playing right around 7pm, although they were only using six of the lanes. Call ahead if you want to be sure. \n\nThey don't make 'em like this anymore.",

  "text": "So to start out on a positive note...my fiance got my engagement ring from here and it is absolutely gorgeous... He ordered online and it shipped very quickly. I couldn't be happier with it. However , when it came time to look for wedding bands we decided it just made sense to go back to Shane Co. Unfortunately the experience was not a good one... The gentleman that offered to help us when we walked in the door seemed almost annoyed that he had to help someone.. but I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he was nearing the end of his shift and just tired. However , we told him we were there to look for wedding bands and I was very excited. He didn't share the excitement ... Didn't ask when the big day was, no interest in us personally . I told him I wanted something Rose gold to match my ring and he started pulling some rings. I noticed the ones he was pulling were much more than we were hoping to spend, so I politely asked him if maybe we could look at something more in the $500-$600 range. I didn't think that was unreasonable based on some styles I had seen online during my research. He immediately said, \"well I can tell you that you aren't going to get a ring with any sort of stone in it in that price range...\"... Okay... So I ended up finding something at the top of that price range that had some small diamonds in it and felt like that was really my only option if I didn't want a plain metal band. He made it obvious he was tired of showing me rings and I felt like I needed to make a decision so next thing I knew I had purchased this ring that I probably wouldn't have originally even picked out. So fast forward a month or so and it was still bothering me that I wasn't completely happy with my ring and felt liked I had been rushed into a decision. So I decided to look elsewhere.  I ended up going to Jared Galleria of Jewelry, and what a stark difference from my experience at Shane. I was greeted immediately by a very bubbly kind woman who was more than happy to show me several options of rings in my price range that were gorgeous. She took her time with me and I felt like she would have spent however long I needed to find the perfect ring . I found a ring I really loved there and was set to buy it but I wanted to give Shane co. one last chance. I went in as soon as they opened today and was greeted by a young woman. I explained to her that I wanted to return a ring I had purchased because I really wasn't sure I liked it but that I was interested in looking at a couple of rings I had seen online. She asked me why I didn't like my ring and I just was honest and explained the prior situation and how I felt rushed into buying something that I wasn't crazy about. She didn't give an apology but jumped at the chance to show me more rings. She looked at my receipt from the original ring and said \"okay I see what your budget is based on this\". She then pulled out a ring and showed it to me. I tried it on and it was really pretty so I took a picture and said I wanted to show my fiance and discuss with him before making the purchase. However I then looked at the price tag and the ring was $1695! Wayyyyyy out of my budget. : ( Plus the ring looked very similar to the one I had found at Jared , but was nearly 3X the cost! I was polite and just told her I think I would just return my other ring today and think about the other ring purchase after discussing with my fiance. She then seemed irritated and lead me to the back to get my refund. Before she left me she said \"sorry about that !\" And then walked off. When I left the store after my return she did not acknowledge me at all... I was very shocked and displeased with both of my experiences ... Especially after hearing all of the commercials that boast about the excellent customer service and great prices from \"cutting out the middle man\". I will be returning to have my engagement ring checked regularly so I don't void my warranty but I don't think I would want to go through the process of looking for jewelry there in the future...",

  "text": "Holy crap. Total splurge, but I loved every dollar and minute of it. I love trying new things, so tapas is always a good bet. We got:\n\n- Chorizo Pamplona. Mmm...I didn't care for the three little side things that came with it; give me straight chorizo (and okay, the bread too) and I'm good!\n\n- Aged manchego cheese with truffled lavender honey-- my husband actually ordered this, and I ended up LOVING it more than he did. I wanted to order another one but I figured I needed to try more on the menu. However, I didn't want it to end and was quite sad when it did.\n\n- Oysters with cava gratina and grapefruit espuma-- I'm not a fan of grapefruit at all, but this was amazing. Perfectly balanced shot of oyster on a spoon (comes with three).\n\n- Almejas con chorizo (clams and chorizo)-- can't get enough of chorizo, and add clams to it, and I'm in heaven! The broth was so good; I was sad the bread was gone, and I thought briefly of drinking it, but alas, more dishes were waiting...\n\n- Piquillos rellenos (crab-stuffed peppers)-- #^%#$%#^& two of my favorite things, rolled together, on a hot sizzling plate with some kind of sauce. I almost swooned; it was SO good.\n\n- Revuelto (shrimp & wild mushroom shirred eggs)-- this came with truffle toast, whose smell catapulted me right back to Yard House, which threw me back home in California. It was like my kind of comfort food with a twist. Awesome, awesome dish.\n\n- Amada's Empanada (spinach, manchego cheese, and artichoke)-- kind of like the one at Alma de Cuba, meaning it was freakin' good and I loved it.\n\nWe ended the savory portion of our meal with the \"Entrecute a la Catalana\" (prime sirloin with catalan spinach, membrillo, and goat cheese). It was good, but was less shiny compared to the other dishes. If we had this earlier in our meal (say, one of the first dishes), it definitely would have stood out more. But because this was the last thing, my taste buds were on overload and the only thing that stood out was the goat cheese (which I don't particularly care for, btw). \n\nDessert was the leche frita (fried vanilla cream, chocolate hazelnut sauce, and hazelnut ice cream). Perfect pairing; it wasn't too sweet. There was this fried thing that went on as garnish, and I really appreciated it, as it provided a bit of salt to balance the sweetness of the rest of the dish.\n\nObviously, this is a crapload of food for only two people, but what can I say...my husband and I love good food and we were starving. ;) Next time, I'd like to try the chef's tasting menu. Aaaaand I'm so taking all my visiting friends to Amada!\n\nP.S. MAJOR bonus points for the bag hooks they have at the bar tables. It's little things like that make me happy.",

  "text": "This is not an easy place to get a table for dinner, but I think after you wait it out you'll see why it's so popular.  We lucked out and nabbed a bar table that had just opened up as we walked in the door.  Bar seating is first come/first served and they have some comfy booths with table service in there.  There was also a piano player providing live music.\n\nBest thing about this place though is definitely the menu.  Every entree is under 475 calories!  I love that you can order anything you want without inducing too much guilt.  We started out with a cherry tomato flatbread appetizer, which was tasty and a good size for a table of four to share.  I had the scallops for my main course and was pleasantly surprised by how large the portions were (all under 475 calories?!).  I didn't feel bad at all about polishing off the whole thing.  Happily, low calorie doesn't equate with low flavor - my dining companions had two specials, the Pacific halibut and buffalo steak, both of which they also polished off.  \n\nDessert was also a nice not-too-decadent treat.  They have a brilliant system for selling desserts:  instead of bringing you a dessert tray where you pick something and they bring it out a few minutes later, they actually bring fresh desserts to your table and immediately serve you whichever one you pick.  All the desserts are made in small glasses so that you get just enough for one person, but not so much that you feel guilty about finishing off every last crumb.  Perfect portion size.  I LOVED my chocolate cake with chocolate mousse - so delicious and rich, but just right for one person!\n\nThe prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food, and they have a decent wine/cocktail menu as well.  Service was excellent.  We left feeling full, happy, and wondering if maybe we'd found a new favorite restaurant.",

Dr. Liberman (sp??) is great, too.\n\nOur only complaint?  very limited (sometime none) Satruday or evening hours.  Kids need appointments after 3 PM and after 6 PM many days.\n\nIt is very hard to get my kid the coveted 5 PM cleaning and I book it months in advance.  (And then, life happens.)\n\nWish they had more weekend and evening hours.  (Maybe open at noon one day a week and work until 8 PM?) Yes, staff hates that - but patients love it!",

  "text": "I had this place come up as a recommendation for Mexican food. They were packed for dinner on a Saturday and for good reason. The food is delicious. I got a mojado burrito which came with rice, sour cream and pico de gallo. Orders come with free chips and you get access to a self serve salsa bar. I loved the black one and the light green salsa. Service was very fast and friendly. Despite the massive number of orders coming through in person, over the phone etc they seem to have a great method set up to get orders out. They do have alcohol here and plenty of seating both indoors and outside. Would definitely come back to try something else.",

I'm personally in love with their Power Salad.  it's delicious!  It's a spinach salad with eggs, bacon, onion rings pieces and almonds.  So good! AND actually ok for you too.  If you're watching calories, you can't go wrong here.  Plus, the ingredients will make sure you stay full for a good bit of time.\n\nI love that they've chosen to add calories to their menus.  i actually think it makes them feel more transparent.  Plus, it helps me to decide what fits into my plan for the day.  Let's face it, I love to eat but I certainly can't afford to eat with abandon and not be aware of calories.  I SO WISH I COULD!  \n\nAnyways, Panera Bread is a good choice for an easy, quick and delicious meal.  They have something for everyone!",

  "text": "If I could stand on top of the roof of this diner with an over sized banner that made people on Pyramid Highway turn up the road and come eat here I totally would.  \n\nThis location has been the home of many failed eateries in the past.  I really hope that this one sticks because they are truly an asset to the community as far as great food and great service goes.\n\nThe place looks a tad confusing from the outside, red and blue sticky lights boarder the door not signifying the american diner food they serve but rather it seems to pay homage to the Mexican place that was there before them.  It throws you off a little bit and I think they could re-brand that portion of the decor but once you walk inside everything goes back to what you might expect.  The walls are a bright yellow, which I loved but my husband had mixed feelings about.  The place is open and airy and really does remind you of a regular plain old diner.  Nothing super special about it but still nice and clean.\n\nThe food offerings are 100% american diner.  Burgers, sandwiches, soup, salad and super amazing great all day breakfast.  The staff was very pleasant and I get the feeling that everyone who works there is family.  Prices are low and the food portions are huge so it's a great value for your buck.  The food is great and my husbands eggs Benedict had the thickest ham slices this side of the east coast that you will ever see on an eggs Benedict order.  \n\nWe left super happy and excited to go back.  Go check it out and tell your friends.  Lets work as a community to give this place the support it needs to stay alive and successful for years to come!",

The veggies were fresh and the food came out uber fast.\n\nThe server was friendly and helpful. The ambiance was kind of whatever but it was clean. The spice level was LOW. I love spicy food and I ordered the highest level on the menu. Don't get me wrong, the food was good but it was not spicy. the bf doesn't like his food as spicy as I do and he said he could have handled the level of heat my curry was at. I chatted with the server a bit and next time we visit I will be ordering a level 10. \n\nI'm looking forward to our next trip out there.",

The patio has huge A/C units for summer and heaters for winter.  There is live music on weekends and trivia on Wednesdays, and other things going on during the week. \nThe bar is fully stocked with whatever you need to get your Guinness fix or hard liquor buzz. They have a great happy hour and I have enjoyed it many times. \nThe food is typical Irish Pub food and I really enjoy the Shepards pie, bangers and mash, and their burgers. It's a big menu with many different choices for the whole family. \nThe St Patricks day celebration is a huge event with all kinds of locals and regulars coming out of the woodwork to Party like the Irish. \nDo yourself a favor and give them a try, maybe you'll become a regular too.",

The place is small and the walls are full of notes hand written by the staff and customers. \n\nThey have a variety of po boy sandwiches and rice plate with your choice of gator, chicken, pork, catfish, shrimp and many others. I'm partial to the pork po boy, their pork is very tasty!\n\nThey don't have brand sodas, which was interesting. Aside from the Stevia soda (which I had never seen outside of vegan/vegetarian/ health food stores and I really like) you can order from a selection of sodas that are simply referenced by their flavor, as well as iced tea and lemonade. \n\nAfter you place your order you look for a place to sit, which can be a challenge during their peak times (make sure to avoid the lunch rush for a more pleasant experience). Once seated you'll have a card with a list of sides, and once you've picked two you can put the card up in the center piece and a server will come to take your side order. Sides are \"free\" and you can order as many as you like, but only two at a time. I was pleasantly surprised by this, as it allows you to try a little bit of everything, portions of sides are small, but again, you can have as many as you like. I am partial to the etouffe, it's a little spicy, but really good. \n\nI feel that they falter a little with the sides, for my taste I find that the cornbread is too sweet, and the garlic stew is too spicy. They experiment with the bread pudding and the two time I've tried it I was disappointed, once it had bacon and was really watery, more recently they had a boo berry variation for Halloween. Other items like French bread and apple sauce are basic enough to be consistently OK. \n\nThe servers are always very friendly, and it's a very high energy environment, they are usually yelling for orders, sides and stuff like napkins and silver ware.\n\nAll in all it's definitely worth checking out, if only for their great po boys.",

Surprisingly this is one of the few non-chain restaurants that are open on a Saturday at 2:30, which is when we showed up ravenously hungry.  So you can imagine that our waiter was a bit flustered at the amount of food we ordered.  Or maybe not, but he was friendly enough not to say anything.\n\nWhen it comes to my scallion pancakes, I'm pretty demanding; they have to be crisp and fluffy and thin -- which, thankfully, Han Dynasty did perfectly, accompanied with a soy dipping sauce that complimented the oniony of it all.  The dandan noodles were full of the kind of hot and spicy that made you want to chug gallons of water while stuffing your face at the same time -- simply put, flavourful and yum.  Pork belly and preserved vegetables were perfect compliments of fatty rich and salty, plus reminded me of home... not a bad thing, mind you!  Chicken with hot dry peppers were surprisingly addictive and delicious.\n\nInterior is pleasantly decorated and amazingly clean -- I'd suggest getting a table, since the booths tend to wiggle and wobble depending on the antics of your neighbours.",

Fast forward to the new menu offerings... \n\nIt was like deja vu. The new Indo-Chinese menu was perfection the first time I ordered. Or, well so I thought. Turns out they messed up the order and gave us the manchurian sauce with the paneer and the garlic sauce with the cauliflower. So the next time we ordered the garlic sauce/paneer combo we were not happy to see the oily weird sauce that had been with our cauliflower. MInd you this sauce is marked as \"hot\" on the menu. Nothing remotely hot about it. \n\nI was also super bummed to see that the green curry was WHITE, unlike the last time I ordered it when it was actually green and lit my mouth up in the most delicious way. This order was just bland and practically curry free.There was also something off about the Malai Kofta. \n\nThe food was so awful that I actually took it back to the restaurant (we'd picked it up) and asked for my money back. After standing there for fifteen minutes they finally acknowledged me. When I explained that the curry was non-existant, the garlic sauce  mishap and the eh Malai Kofta they focused on the Malai Kofta and asked their chef to taste it, then told me it was fine. Ok, great what about the white curry sauce? No acknowledgement, the mixup on the sauces the first time that led us to believe we were ordering one thing and not the other. Whatever. We placed an order at Ekta while waiting for the refund. Too bad, because when Tiffin is good they are amazing, but when they are bad they are beyond terrible. I won't be back, not worth the risk.",

I go to North Beach so I have seen some Italian bakeries but  this one truly had one of the most diverse and unusual selections I have seen.\nThe cannoli were awesome and beautifully presented. It took us forever to decide what to have as there were choices I had not seen before, like the lemon ricotta(?) pie my daughter selected, light and tangy and different. My other daughter choose a berry and cantaloupe sorbet which was also wonderful. I didn't try the clove cookies shaped like  bones or the spumoni cake but seriously wanted to. We bought some anise cookies to go and they were melt in your mouth wonderful later when we ate them. \nIt is probably good I don't live near here but I would recommend this place to anyone who likes pasties, cookies or ice cream and perhaps wants to try something they have never had before.",

  "text": "UPDATE: Review #2\n\nI can now leg press 500lbs. \n\nMy 12 weeks with Natali have ended. I am going to try things on my own for the next 12 weeks, and then hopefully start again (I am more than willing but she is becoming even busier with clients!)\n\nI have lost some pounds and definitely some inches. I have had some physical and emotional setbacks, so I may have been able to do better, but Natali never once even hinted that she was unhappy with me. She understands that her clients are doing the best they can for that given moment. She is ONLY full on encouragement, positivity and she is darn funny. \n\nI also improved beyond the numbers:\n\n1. I am a lot stronger physically. \n\n2. I am no longer even remotely intimidated by the gym. I'm right next to all the other serious lifters and they are awesome, inclusive people. No one cares about my work out if I am doing my own thing and not impeding someone else. I have the right to be in the gym just like everyone else.\n\n3. I WANT to go to the gym. I WANT to lift heavy (and I mean heavy). I have always loved it but Natali helped me cultivate it more by challenging me. \n\n4. Meal planning gets the job done.\n\n5. I am a beast in the gym. Natali knew it when she met me and she kept challenging me until I figured it out myself. And when I did it changed me.\n\n6. YOU are the deciding factor. Do the work and get the results. Figure out who you are. Natali has your back.\n\nI can now leg press 500lbs. With ease. I know I said it before but I went from lifting 175 to 500 in 12 weeks. \n\nI cannot wait to try it alone for 12 weeks and go back to the teacher after doing my homework.",

  "text": "I love Kumi!!\n\nHaving been around for almost a year now, Kumi has made quite the name for itself.  Their gel nails are amazing and very comparable in pricing.  All of their nail techs now are very professional and extremely talented.  I saw Chantelle and she gave me my best set of nails I've ever had.  She took her time to make sure all of them were even and perfect.  \n\nKumi also has guarantee that if your nails for any reason get messed up within a week, they will fix it for no charge.  (I'm pretty sure they still have this policy as far as I know) \n\nMy biggest problems when coming to Kumi is deciding on what colour or design I want  another thing is that because they are so wonderful, they do book up quite fast.  I would call as soon as you know your schedule and book in to make sure you can get the time you want.  It takes about 2 hrs give or take, so clear your schedule for it :) it's definitely worth it!\n\nI love that they have free parking, if they didn't I probably would not come here since it's right downtown.  Their space is modern and elegant and I love the art on the wall.  It keeps getting updated every time I go! \n\nIf you're looking for a great set of nails, try to get in with Kumi! You will not regret it!! And your nails will thank you!!",

  "text": "I love this zoo. It does get pretty busy though. I would highly recommend that you go during the week or in the late afternoon as everyone else is leaving. Everyone always thinks that the best time to go is in the morning. Don't go in the morning, everyone arrives in the morning. \n\nI highly recommend buying the membership. Parking ($16) is free and you pretty much pay for the membership if you go at least twice in a year. I like the idea of the membership because I don't feel like I'm wasting money by just going to the zoo for a couple hours vs the entire day. Most visits we only see about half or less of the animals and get outta there. We see the other half during the next visit. \n\nPACK YOUR OWN FOOD AND DRINKS!!!\n\nYou're allowed to bring food into the zoo. Don't be that person who spends $12 on a meal (I'm guilty of this every single time I visit the zoo). You can save so much money by bringing your own food. Pick up a small carry cooler from target and a couple of ice packs, you're good to go.",

  "text": "Been wanting to try this place since we moved to Westchase. Conveniently located next to Publix its a very quaint place. We decided to stop in before going to Publix. (Grocery shopping while starving is not good within our family)\n\nInside the decor is very laid back. I felt as if I was in Southern Cali on the beach for a moment. \n\nThe Chips and Salsa were delicious and we got the Volcano Shrimp to split. Let me preface by saying I LOVE Bang Bang Shrimp from Bonefish, but these top those. Less breading than Bonefish it had a light crunch with a topped with \"goodness \". I found out they can be placed on tacos which they have Taco Night on Thursdays. $2.50 Shrimp tacos? OMG....dine in or take out. What?\n\nSOLD! I'm already making my list for this upcoming Thursday! Yes, please!!!",

  "text": "Woohoo! Finally a great restaurant a few mins from where I live.\n\nSeeing that this place is new and there's been lots of great reviews already my sister and I decided to check it out. And I am so glad we did.\n\nWe came in for Lunch on a week day and it was busy. The hostess asked if we had made reservations, we had not but they had one table left (wow thank goodness).\n\nFirst impression of the building was it reminded me of a greenhouse/ mod workshop (hence the name). It was clean and bright with all the Windows. I immediately fell in love with the place.\n\nOur Server was extremely knowledgeable with the wine menu and made the decision on what wine we should drink. I can't remember the exact wine I had but needless to say it was delicious and went well with our lunch. Which we ordered for starters the beet salad. The salad looked beautiful like art on a plate, which also tasted amazing. For mains I had the Salmon which was cooked to perfection and my sister had the perogies (which she raved about). All the elements on our dishes were fresh, light, and vibrant.\n\nThe desserts were nice and compact in a mason jar type. Both were tasty and I would definitely have again.\n\nThis place is going to be on number one on my lists, I can't wait to try the brunch!",

  "text": "Came here for my Mom's birthday and was floored.  The place is small, gorgeous and family-run, with Chef John in the back and his lovely wife Liz treating us like we were dining in their home.  And the food was spectacular.\n\nThe following is what we had (descriptions are from their menu, because there's no way I'd remember everything).\n\nAppetizers:\n\n- Santa Rosa Island Crab Salad with Papaya & Fresh Ginger-Lime Dressing\n- Lobster & Angelhair Salad with Asparagus, Sundried Tomatoes, Olives & Basil\n- Artichoke Heart Salad with Fresh Herb Vinaigrette\n\nMy favorite appetizer was probably the lobster and angel hair salad.  But the flavors in every appetizer were so distinct and deliberate and never overpowering.  Chef John is just an incredible talent.\n\nEntrees:\n\n- Colorado Lamb Loin with Roasted Garlic, Tom Shepherd's Green Beans & Rosemary\n- Grilled Duck with Fresh Peach Chutney, Exotic Grains & Ginger Sauce\n\nLiz informed us these are the two dishes the restaurant is known for, and it's easy to see why.  I liked the lamb slightly more, but you can't go wrong with either.\n\nThe one hiccup of the night came when we were informed that they only had one more serving of the lamb and it was slightly overcooked.  We tried it and sadly had to send it back.  But to make up for it, Chef John had about 2/3 of an order of the duck (it didn't have the leg) and sent it out on the house.  Extremely gracious.\n\nDesserts:\n\nI wish I could remember what all the desserts were, but the unanimous favorite for us was the homemade peach ice cream with almond cookies.  It was stunningly good.\n\nIf you have a special night coming up and want to make a first class go of it, look no further.  This was flat-out one of the best meals I've had so far this year, if not the best.",

And great location, especially if you're staying at the Moonrise like we were.\n\nWe actually ate here twice in several days!  The first night was terrific.  We got the Brussels Sprouts appetizer, which is outstanding.  Piping hot, served in a skillet with sizzling onions, garlic, pancetta pieces and a few slices of cheese, this was a great appetizer.  And the pasta bolognese was one of the best bolognese dishes we've had at any Italian restaurant, not just in St. Louis.  Pasta was just the right texture, sauce was tasty, meaty, just a hint of sweetness, and nice and thick.  Just delicious.  Salad (Caesar) was also very good.\n\nAnd just outstanding service.  Our server, Lauren, said it was her first night.  You'd NEVER have known that.  She was just excellent, checking on us at the right times, refilling dishes, etc.   Even the young man hosting who seated us was great, a really personable guy who made us feel welcome the minute we entered the restaurant.  And it didn't end there, either.  Every single staff member acknowledged us, engaged us, and made us feel truly welcomed.\n\nThe second night we returned, the food wasn't quite as good as the first night but still more than solid, we just got different dishes is all.  Still got the great Brussels Sprouts appetizer, but this time got spaghetti and meatballs and chicken scalloping.  Both were very good but just not great like the bolognese was.  But we ate at the bar and Reagan, our bartender and server, did a wonderful job.  She even made us a drink she hadn't made before (French 75) and absolutely nailed it based on the recipe we found.  She was really personable, we had a great time talking to her and interacting with not only her but again other staff/managers.  They were all truly kind and generous and welcoming.  \n\nThis was one of very few Italian restaurants that satisfied on multiple levels. This was a fun restaurant to eat at and we will definitely return when in St. Louis.",

They do a great job of finding the appointment time that works for you. \n\nOur cat Grady has gone in twice for general check up and shots. The Doctors are very friendly and good with him. They are very careful to keep him calm and treat him with love. The doctors have helped us in understanding our cat's behavior and needs. I have been to vet's in the past where they tried to make you feel guilty about how you take care of your pet (Your CAT HAS LOST 10 pounds what the heck are you doing to him!) and this vet didn't do that at all! They were very good at making sure we knew we were doing a good job and they offered suggestions on how we can continue to keep our cat in good health. \n\nI love the fact that they will call you back after the appointment or surgery to see how everything is going. After we had our cat \"Fixed\" the called and I told the Doctor about how my cat loves to eat the household plants and we caught him with leaves in his cone. She laughed at how cute he was and was glad to hear Grady was doing well. \n\nGrady has received shots, boosters, exams, micro-chipped, and has been \"Fixed\" at this clinic and we have had zero complications. \n\nThey have been really good to us and our cat. I will continue to use this clinic while I live in the Edmonton area. (Also if it's a stressful event for a patient's owner the Keg and Cork liquor store is in the same plaza)",

  "text": "There is a lot of potential at Pearl Diver. The interior is gorgeous and well-themed and the outdoor space makes you feel that you are transported to an island. Plus I love the cabanas and the overall vibe is really cool and interesting. \nHowever, there were some pretty significant issues. First, you have to order at the bar or window connected to the outdoor space. I definitely had more luck at the bar, but just come here planning to wait to order. That alone isn't a dealbreaker though. I'm fine to wait if I'm getting some interesting drinks and delicious food. Unfortunately Pearl Diver didn't deliver there either. While the port to port cocktail was delicious, it only tasted like fruit juice and was very weak. If I'm paying $12 I want it to taste like an adult beverage. I tried the Paloma later and it was better but also very weak and mostly ice. I was excited about the food but bummed when the mushroom and shishito peppers came out with a laughable amount. There were seriously 5 of them on a skewer and the mushrooms were a huge let down and not worth $9 for these items. Luckily the dumplings and dipping sauce were good so it wasn't a total waste. \nAt the end of our night we enjoyed talking to the bartender and sampled a shot of the daiquiri which was delicious and what I should have ordered instead of the other fruit heavy beverages I sampled. The bottom line is that I paid $50 leaving hungry and completely sober which makes me grumpy. Luckily I was hanging out with an awesome group of ladies so it wasn't a total loss but I'm not rushing back, especially since it's the new place to be and super popular. Maybe they know something I don't?",

Like I want it EVERY NIGHT FOR ALWAYS AND FOREVER.\n\nRegardless, by the time I'm done with dinner, I want to get out and move about, which means finding ice cream places farther and farther from the domicile to explore.\n\nNow there are some lovely local chain-type places you can go, and there are also national chains to visit, but Ice Cream 504?  This one is unique.  This is the one to visit when you're feeling adventurous and really want to go out on your comfort game.\n\n1. The owner is amazing.  He's so much fun to chat with, brainstorm with, and find out about the different flavors from.  He's a great guy, and worth the stop just for his charm and wit.\n\n2. The flavors!  Go there and try something you wouldn't expect, like jalapeno ice cream!  We had a sampling of the unique flavors before settling on our palates with our favorites.  I won't even go into it, because they rotate and change, like any great local shop should.  What's in season?  Who knows -- go try it!\n\nIf you're looking for fun, either by the scoop, malt, shake, or sundae, head over here to try them out.  You'll be amazed at what you try and what you'll really like, for reals.",

There is a music shop attached to the market that a couple of my previous music groups used to perform at. They carry some great local and some international albums and instruments.

We started with shrimp spring rolls that were very yummy, I especially loved the peanut sauce that came with them! We also both ordered pho. The pho was delicious! I really like that they have small and large sizes of pho and that there are a variety of flavors to choose from! I had the shrimp pho with chicken broth instead of beef broth. The broth was very flavorful and the small was still a huge bowl! While I found myself comparing it to Lilly's spicy shrimp pho (my absolute favorite), I was able to add in the right amount of hoisin and sriracha to make my own version.\n\nThe prices were very reasonable (less than $10 for a bowl of pho) and the waitresses were friendly and quick to refill our drinks. Keep in mind that they close at 8:30 so don't try to come in and eat too late! They were nice to let us finish up even after their 8:30 closing time. I will definitely return for more pho!\n\nFood -- 4.5 stars\nPrice -- 4.5 stars\nService -- 4 stars\nAtmosphere -- 4 stars",

The flavor and base of the French onion tasted like wine or something. I ate it but wasnt a huge huge fan.",

The food is good quality as well. \n\nIt's within walking distance of my house and it's a great place to go during the day or at night. It DOES tend to get crowded on the nights they have musicians (which is often), but that's part of the fun. They also showcase local artists each month. \n\nOh and for those that are noise-adverse I know they opened a back building just for that purpose.",

A \"Revived historic inn with antique-industrial decor & American tavern.\"\nIt was cold and crappy-rainy when we were up there a few days ago and found this really nice comfortable, cozy, eclectic fun place. I had a Gran Marnier, to warm my bones, the \"Chipotle Shrimp Tacos\". Chipotle Marinated Shrimp, Black Bean Puree, Pickled Asian Slaw, Tropical Fruit Salsa, Avocado-YUM!! Not sure why I got the shrimp tacos because, gee! I can get those anytime I want here in West Palm Beach, lol! But they sounded good and were really were. I have to say that when I have gotten them here in Florida there's not much shrimp, but these?? There were a lot of shrimp and they were really good! My boyfriend had the \"Sout Side Beef Sangwitch\". A Sliced Steak, Giardiniera Relish, Gruyère, Au Jus Grilled Long Roll with fries. I would go back if I do go back into that area. But there are so many great places up there that I may never make it.\nThe waitress was very friendly and accommodating. I just loved the town and the whole ambiance of this place.\nHopefully this makes someone's choice of where to go to easier to choose.",

  "text": "Well, I noticed a fellow yelper that I definitely have had conversations about the local Korean food around here. I saw that they had kim-bab which is a classic Korean style sushi roll. We had to come. \n\nI mean yeah ok, I've made my own bibimbap before so when I saw that we were getting a new restaurant, I had to try it out and see if it really tasted like how it was when I was a kid. \n\nWell the kim-bab, uh-mazing! I love kim-bab. I hope they open up more ideas on what they put inside. My aunt would make me a spicy dried squid kim-bab that I love eating. I know a lot of people would like it. I wonder if I could give them that idea. Hmmmm \n\nWell, we got the spicy pork fresh bowl, the spicy pork Bowl, the marinated beef bowl, spicy wings, and the shrimp fried rice. The kids ate it all up. The miso soup that came with it complimented each bite of the spicy pork fresh bowl.\n\nIt reminded me of when I would eat at my aunts house and she would make a soybean soup, aka Korean miso style soup with the kimbab or bibimbap. It's really nice to see a lot of different Korean culture growing here in the reno sparks area. It reminds me of when I was growing up. \n\nWe couldn't get enough so we ordered more Togo. Spicy pork Bowl and the soft tofu vegetable rice, oh and the japchae. I tried the soft tofu soup bowl when I got home. Oh my wowza, ok ok if you know me my favorite Korean food is the soft tofu soup. I love that all day everyday. So when I tasted the bowl it tasted exactly like the soup, but just without it coming out piping hot and the broth. Oh my wow. I wish I would've gotten that in the beginning. I can't wait to eat it tomorrow.",

There is a reason why Tavern is listed among the best brunch places in Nashville. Their food is tasty and not the run of the mill brunch options. Tavern is definitely my favorite of the M street concepts (Virago, Whiskey Kitchen, etc.)\n\nI got their red sangria for both of my brunch drinks and my friend got the peach bellini both times as well. I got the Benedict Uno which has short rib and poached eggs on an English muffin with a Tabasco hollandaise. I wasn't sure if I would like the hollandaise so I ordered it on the side. I actually really loved the sauce but it was so rice that I am glad it was on the side. The short rib was tasty albeit just a tad dry but the hollandaise fixed that. My friend got the Benedict Dos. This has smoked salmon and poached eggs on an English muffin with a caper hollandaise. This was so yummy. I had a bite of hers and then I wanted more. \n\nI got to give a shoutout to our server, Tim. He was so nice and friendly and provided us with exceptional service. Two other staff members came around to check on us too, so I was just really impressed with the service all around. \n\nA great casual brunch spot with something for everyone.

  "text": "Such a good pizza and salad spot! Highly recommend when you are in Reno. The many different options they have here is what keeps me coming back. They have traditional pizzas with meat and pepperoni such as the Z carnivore pizza etc but they also have veggie pizza options and vegan pizza options which really impressed me being vegetarian.\n\nI personally love their Tuscan mushroom pizza and pear/Gorgonzola salad! The Tuscan mushroom pizza consists of house made roasted garlic sauce, mozzarella cremini, shittake, and button mushrooms with Carmelized onions feta and truffle oil!!! Such a flavorful combination and what's better it is vegetarian. Their crust is super fresh, and the right amount of crispy, all the ingredients and sauces mix well together...everything is standard perfection when it comes to the combo! The pear and Gorgonzola salad consists of mixed greens, pear slices, walnuts and their balsamic vinaigrette. Both the pizza and salad together is bomb. Another option you can do is also make any salad into a pizza so that's pretty cool.\n\nI haven't tried the other pizzas but my family has tried them and also recommends the Napoli and ZBQ. To be honest all of them sound good! They also serve chicken wings! \n\nShout out to the workers who helped us-Robert, Carlo, Chris and of course the owners Maria and Noel who introduced themselves to us as well. All are so helpful, professional, friendly, very efficient and overall just good people. It always helps when the workers are so kind and welcoming to their loyal customers. Definitely recommend this pizza place for sure!",

We've been there 6 or 8 times when my husband has business close by and it's excellent. \nYou are greeted when you enter, it's very clean, and white table cloths but casual.  The servers are very attentive.  -for me that means water refills without asking and being available for naan refills if needed.  When you're finished, you get up and go to the cashier who has your bill, so there's no waiting for the check.  (good system especially for the biz crowd)  The buffet has more selections than any other that I know.  The Naan comes out fresh and hot, and if you ask for a refill just wait a little because it's made fresh to order.  Everything on the buffet is very good.  I have prepared alot of Indian food at home and I like it a little spicier, but it still is very flavorful here.  I love the lamb (they don't always have it so sometimes I call ahead).  This is where I first tried goat.  (yeah goat)  It wasn't gamey or strong.  We raised goats for milk on the farm in the 60's (I've since learned more) & some meat (if goat is too old) & cheeses (if aged too long) taste like a goat smells.  (go figure,Yuk)\n \nDisclaimer **Take heed**  Don't come right before the lunch time closing.  They seem rude (western standards), and tell you to hurry & get your food because they are going to remove all food shortly.  -and they do remove it the minute they close.  They make their point and since that happened to us once, we make sure to go early.  I've watched it happen to others that came late when we were finishing.  They left, and I'm sure many do not come back.  (it's not our way to be rushed at a meal if we don't want to)\nGo early and enjoy!",

I ordered a steak sandwich, which was nice and juicy. The vegetables on it were fresh and the bread was pressed just right. The french fries were golden and cooked enough to be crispy, but still soft. I also tried their plantain chips, which were decent. I ordered a Mango shake, and although the waitress initially gave me the wrong order, she was really quick and kind about changing it back to the right one. The food wasn't too heavy, but still filling.\n\nI love the atmosphere in the restaurant though. It's like you're dining at home (the place looks like a house after all both on the inside and outside). It's a true Spanish diner in every sense of the name.

You start with salatim and hummus and let me explain that salatim involves eight (yes I said eight!) different salads. And you will want to try them all. With the fresh hot bread. Let the gluttony begin.\n\nThen get ready for two mezze, one skewer and dessert. And that's per person. Holy cow, you're gonna need some time to digest that. Woof.\n\nBut I don't want to mislead you by giving you the impression that this restaurant is all about the quantity...oh no. In fact I typically avoid any place that has reviews that say \"the servings were gigantic and we had enough for three days.\" No, this is not that kind of place.\n\nComplex flavors, tasty new things to try, lovely service. What are you waiting for?",

We find the best places to eat! \nI get to eat great treats in the presence of magnificence! \n\nWe stopped in to Kally K's for lunch, not sure what to expect. But, we left highly satisfied and will definitely be going back. \n\nAntonio, or Tony, took excellent care of us from the moment we entered. He was very polite and made us feel welcome. He immediately took our drink orders, and briefed us on the menu and the Salad Bar. \nHe REALLY got my attention when he said there were 2 soups on the bar and one was Clam Chowder! I couldn't wait to pick something off the menu and then get a cup of Chowdah! \n\nThe Clam Chowder was really, really good. Nice chunks of clam and potatoes in a creamy smooth base with lots of taste. Just like it should be!\nFunny thing! Up until recently, and I'm talking within the last year or so, I didn't even eat Clam Chowder. My beautiful Fab One convinced me to try some one night, and ever since then I've been on a Chowder Bender! \nI love that Mollusky Medley!\n\nAlong with the soup from the Salad Bar, I made myself a nice salad, and other goodies typical for a well stocked bar. Everything was fresh, flavorful and delicious. \n\nTo go with my soup & salad, I ordered the Gyro Sandwich, with fries. What I got was a huge handful of pita packed Wow! The meat was juicy and succulent with that peppery good lamb flavor note. \nAnd I raved about the Tzatziki sauce that was drizzled over my Gyro!!!! This white bite of dill-liciousness swept me off of my Happy Feet.....I asked, or insisted that Tony congratulate the person responsible for this Heavenly Greek gravy! He did, he did..\n\nFab one simply ordered the Salad Bar, and started out with a cup of Chowder as well. She smiled the entire time, and I KNOW the look of contentment on that loving face....\n\nGive Kally K's a try, and tell them John & Beth sent ya!",

  "text": "I was looking forward to trying the Welcome Diner. We had breakfast there 01/08/17, a Sunday. Our group of four arrived at 10 am and there was a 30 minute wait. \n\nI love the fact that Welcome Diner has stepped up and saved this mid-century diner. I'll be honest, I always admired the building but never ate in the previous businesses that occupied it. \n\nAfter the 30 minute wait, and it was a true 30 minute wait, our group was sat at a booth.\n\nOur waitress let us know they were out of two breakfast items, the Birria y tamal (goat) and the Housemade brioche. Because it was before 11am, only the breakfast menu was available. This left just 11 options to choose from, it seamed like a small list. These are not traditional breakfast items, I would recommend looking at a menu before you go. I asked the server about daily specials and there weren't any. I know our group would have been interested in the brioche and the goat but it wasn't meant to be. \n\nI ordered the simple omelette, $8, and our friend ordered the same. The guys order a breakfast sandwich (el birote) $9, and a bowl of \"pork posole rojo\" with eggs, $15. \n\nOur simple order took over 30 minutes to get to us. The server did bring us a bowl of granola to snack on because the food was taking so long. We never asked about the food, so this was a nice gesture on her part. The granola turned out to be my favorite part of the meal. \n\nMy omelet didn't come with a side, just toast, and no choice on the toast. The waitress said it also came with fruit but it turned out to be a fruit garnish not a side of fruit. My iced tea and the refill were so weak, maybe the weakest iced tea I have ever had. \n\nThe general food review was, everything was ok but not that great. Next time our group gets together we will choose a different breakfast spot.",

I recommend it to everyone, plates can be shared or not! Desserts were excellent! Great place for lunch, dinner or just drinks!\n\nThe service? Well, I do have to say this... there could be a little bit of improvement. On a couple of visits, our waiter/waitress-1. forgot our drink order, 2. didn't know what were in the cocktails, the last visit we were still eating and the waiter interrupted us twice, to ask if he could box up our food or take our plate - while we had food on it still. Another visit, our waitress sat down at our table, gave us our bill and complained about this being her 2nd job... a reason it being no big deal that she didn't ask if we wanted dessert. \n\nBut overall, the food and atmosphere are excellent!",

They have a gym and indoor pool and a spa right across from the gym.  I love the view from the gym (3rd floor) and they also have a pool and bar n grill on the roof top.  The only thing that's kind of a bummer is that they don't have a garage for self parking; only valet and I think it was $40 per day.  But it's pretty much nearby all the museums and close by Broadway that either you Uber it or you can walk it.

  "text": "I've had this place on my \"must try\" list for awhile. We finally stopped by to give it a whirl. We showed up on a Saturday shortly after opening, 11:30ish. We were the only patrons.\n\nI love the casual feel of the place, but was a little turned off but the \"order at the counter and take a number\" process. Mainly because it forces guests to excuse themselves from their tables and conversations to order another drink or more food, etc. I would imagine this greatly impacts their profitability as we didn't even bother with getting up to order a second drink and go through the payment/ordering process. But it's a strange model to have when there's a bar in the back corner which would suggest its easy to have a waiter/waitress model, especially judging by the number of employees that were present. It's not a deal breaker, just more of an inconvenience. But......be aware that the pours of wine are VERY stringy, less than a typical glass of wine for an above average price. \n\nOnto the food....\nWe started with the guac and Chips which was very bland and very disappointing. We both ordered 3 tacos each to explore the menu, a combination of: Chicken Tinga, the blackened Fish taco, bahn mi pork belly and Braised Short rib. Unfortunately the only tacos we really enjoyed were the Short rib and pork belly. The other tacos seemed very under seasoned. The chicken oddly tasted reheated/leftover taste and the fish taco was overtaken by a very floral/perfume tasting red hot sauce drizzled on top. BUT, I have the distinct feeling we caught them on an off day or were just the first guests to roll through on this particular Saturday- so will try again. Hopefully it's better on round 2.",

We got there 7:00 and the wait for two was about a little less than an hour. it's a cold wait on the pier because of the wind so don't forget to bring a jacket!! \n\nafter a long wait, we got seated right at the railing next to the water. what a beautiful view especially as the sun was setting over the water. the lights were reflected and it was truly a beautiful sight\n\nI ordered the cioppino and my friend ordered the abalone. It came out promptly - nice and hot. I've never had abalone but when I tried it I really enjoyed it. The cioppino comes in a bread bowl which got a bit soggy. I wish they would've used something that didn't get as soft or even toasted it a bit. It comes with crab, clams, mussels, shrimp, and scallop. As a seafood lover, I really appreciated this. The broth was nice and flavorful but there just wasn't enough of it (or perhaps the bread soaked it up...) Honestly I just don't think a bread bowl is the best vessel for cioppino... Large portion though - I couldn't finish and took it togo\n\nBTW they use paper straws here and I personally hate them - would rather just have no straw honestly. Good service and nice ambiance. Perhaps a bit pricy though. They have a takeout window which is much faster and they even have some picnic tables you can sit at right by the water",

  "text": "In town for a weekend getaway and having no knowledge of the local food scene, I came across Mood Cafe while searching. Good reviews, excellent photos and decent prices brought me in, and I couldn't have been happier with my choice. Thank you again, Yelp, for steering me to such a great find in the city of brotherly love.\n\nMood Café had some seriously high reviews.. a solid 5 star rating with close to 250 reviews, so they've got to be doing something right. They serve a dish called Chaat here.. something I've never heard of and something that I figured I might as well try. \n\nThis place is much smaller than I expected. No real sitting area, but they have a couple of makeshift tables and plastic stools for people who want to eat there. Plastic forks, knives and napkins sit by the door as a \"grab your own\" kind of thing. You place your order at the counter and they prepare it in plastic to go containers.\n\nHaving no clue what I wanted, I told the guy behind the counter that I was in town for the night, saw they had some great reviews on Yelp, and I wanted to see what it was all about. He explained one of the menus was yogurt based smoothies and the other was the chaat. He also helped steer me by asking if I wanted vegetarian or the type of protein I wanted. \n\nI think I should point out that I had no clue what chaat was and really still don't. I know it has a lot of tasty sauces.. some crunchy bits and fresh mango in it. Mine had the Chicken Tikka in it too, because that's what I ordered. There were some items in my dish that were cold and some that were hot. Some bits were crunchy and some bits were not. While I cannot tell you exactly what it was (or if it was authentic like some reviews claim it is not) I can tell you it was delicious and I ate every bite of it.\n\nI also ordered the blueberry lassi and was really happy with it. A friend ordered the mango and we were each given a full glass of what we ordered and a smaller cup with the other one so we could taste it. I thought this was a really nice gesture and was very appreciative of it.\n\nI'd love to tell all of my friends about Mood Café and haul them all to Philly to give it a try, but there wouldn't be enough room in the place for everyone. Instead, I can only share my experience and hope it steers you inside on some cold and rainy night as it did me.",

  "text": "For my 100th Review on Yelp, I waited for someplace that was really special. It was a serious tie between Welcome Diner and Cafe Poca Cosa, but I decided to make the later review #101.\n\nThis was my second time at Welcome Diner and I loved it just as much as the first visit. Actually, the first time I went here, my car had been broken into at the Gem Show that day. My friends and I were exhausted and traumatized and the Welcome Diner experience took the edge off the whole stressful day.\n\nOn my first visit, I had the jackfruit fries...much better than I expected. I'm actually not very adventurous with food and not a big fan of meat substitutes​, but the jackfruit was very good. \n\nThis visit I had the No Way Jose Burger, which was delicious. It was a cross between a good fast food burger (like In and Out, not Burger King) and a gourmet burger. Sometimes the gourmet burgers (like ZinBurger) are so rich, they're like eating dessert. The No Way Jose Burger had good balance. The greens in the side salad we nice and fresh, no icky, over-ripe leaves which can be a problem. \n\nMy friend got the Eggs Benedict which she said was really good. I should have tried the hollandaise sauce but didn't think of it. \n\nFor dessert, we had a Lemon Lavender cookie and a chocolate chip cookie. Both were tasty, not bakery quality but good. The coffee was good. I'm a coffee snob so I was pleased I didn't have the immediate \"yuck\" response to a generic-tasting coffee.\n\nThe building is classic Mid-Century Modern and there was a sign outside that said Pie with an arrow pointing to the door. To me, anytime you can go to a restaurant and it's an experience, even if it's not perfect, that's something.\n\nBoth times I was here the service was good. I read some other reviews that said the service was spotty. The thing is, this is the antithesis of a corporate restaurant experience so of course, there's going to be some​ inconsistencies. That's the reason why you'd go here, because it's real and authentic. \n\nMy friend that went with me has lived in Tucson for several years and didn't know about it. I'd highly recommend the Welcome Diner because it has that kind of cool factor that makes it memorable. \n\nAnd who doesn't love comfort food?",

The buzz is well deserved.  \n\nGrafitti/collage combined with dry ramen noodles being used as a wall decoration was just too flippin' adorable.\n\nPork was the dumpling special of the day and chicken was the Bahn Mi of the day.  So we ordered both of those and the ramen.\n\nTHESE ARE THE BEST DUMPLINGS I HAVE EVER HAD.  And I have eaten a lot of incarnations of dumplings at a lot of different places.  The texture was superb and it absolutely melted in my mouth.  So flavorful.  We asked for chili oil on the side (I was worried about Han Dynasty level heat) but it's relatively mild.\n\nThe ramen was brilliant as well.  It had such an interesting taste; it is a miso based broth but it had this flavor that was just so unique and worked so well.  Cheu poaches the egg instead of soft boiling and that was also a great touch and lets the egg mix infuse with the broth.\n\nThe Bahn Mi was also delicious and loved the spicy mayo as a condiment.  Unfortunately I have an aversion to cilantro and that ended up overpowering the dish.  If you love cilantro then you would probably love this.\n\nService was nice and attentive, the noodle bar overlooks the kitchen so you can see them preparing your dishes.  \n\nSeriously just a fab addition to Philly's noodle scene. A great, small casual dining spot.  Cannot wait to go back!",

And easy drive up and down Intercoastal for all the other beaches in the area, plus great nature parks.  Little nook areas with cool fancy art and clothing stores abound too, like Pass-a-Grille.

  "text": "I've been looking forward to trying Saki as I've heard good things from Rachel M. and Melinda M. And unlimited sushi?! Yes please!! I also had a coupon and thought now is a good time as any,and we'll save a few bucks!\n\nWe came early, as it was a Friday night, and I'm sure it can get packed. We got seated immediately. We wanted to order a drink, so we asked our waitress what beer did they have on tap. She wasn't sure, so she went to check and came back with the answer. Then we asked if they served sake, she wasn't sure, so she went to check and came back. I wish there was a list available so then she wouldn't have to go and check and then come back with the answer.\n\nI love the concept of ordering a la carte for a buffet. You know it's freshly made, and it hasn't been sitting under a heat lamp for who knows how long. I immediately order our limited 8 pieces of sashimi per person. Too bad sashimi wasn't' truly AYCE, I would've then given this place 5 stars! I ordered some of the hot food items as well as nigiri until I was stuffed.\n\nFor a Buffet it's good. Is it the best Sushi I've ever had? No. But again, let me iterate, it's a buffet, buffets aren't Michelin rated restaurants. I do love the concept of ordering a la carte but when it's busy it's a little bit slow getting to your table. Get there early and you can avoid that and make it to a movie afterwards!",

  "text": "East Beach Grill is a pleasant place to get breakfast by the beach. I came with Matt B. and his dad for some pancakes on a chilly Sunday morning, and it was pretty nice despite the brisk breeze. We had our dog with us on the patio, and he spent most of our meal getting petted by the most adorable nine-year-old twin boys. They vowed to distract him from our food, and they did an excellent job.\n\nThe place was busy but not quite full, and we had no problem seating ourselves. We ordered at the counter and the food was brought to our tables. Very easy.\n\nWe all ordered pancakes, which is apparently the thing to get at East Beach Grill. I got the banana wheat germ pancakes with sides of bacon and eggs. The pancakes were delicious, fluffy yet substantial, studded through with sweet morsels of banana. I got my eggs over easy and these were fine, nothing special, and the bacon was not as satisfying as bacon should be. Really, the pancakes are the main attraction.\n\nAll of us, dog included, enjoyed our visit to East Beach Grill. It's a great spot for a lovely scenic breakfast, and I'd recommend it if you want some oceanside pancakes.",

  "text": "Color me surprised, another new QT has opened up in the city. Quick Trip is becoming like Walgreens and Starbucks. It almost seems that there is one on every corner. Or at least every other block. This QT is a prime location - it has easy access on and off of 44 and is just a hop, skip and a jump from 64/40. \n\nI'm driving to work earlier then most people get up for work and a convenience market is important to me. It may be a gas station, but their selection and variety of coffee satisfies my need for caffeine. This new location is one that has the kitchen in the center, I can't wait to try it. However, for now I can tell you, if you need a quick breakfast their 99¢ Sausage Biscuit will hit the spot and fill the void. \n\nThe staff seems to be friendly and professional and if they can do that in the wee hours of the morning - they've got a good team. \n\nWill I return? Yes - I've fallen out of love with my current gas station and convenience store. \n\nWhen: March 25, 2017\nWhy: It's new and I needed coffee.",

The only downside for me, and the reason they don't get that 5th star, it's the crazy mark ups on the prices.  After finding a new red wine I really loved, I came home and looked it up on the PLCB website to see if I could buy a bottle nearby.  To my surprise, a bottle was priced at $13, and I had just paid $11 for a 5oz pour.  Boo.  \n\nBut, I'll support the local economy and keep on going.. it's a great way to try new things, and overall it's a nice chill spot to have in the neighborhood.\n\n...omg I can't believe I forgot to mention the mead.

I've been here at least 1/2 a dozen times over the last 10 years and I look forward to going back at some point. \n\nI recommend going any time of the year!  I actually love visiting during the holidays; their winter displays are breathtakingly beautiful and it's a nice treat when the days are shorter and we all long for a taste of spring/summer.  Between the indoor displays of flowers and plants from around the world.... the heavenly aromas....and the meticulously maintained grounds... my friends, you will not be disappointed!\n\nThis place is on the pricey side but it's so worth it!  It's about a 2.5 hour drive from the DC area (approx) so it's perfect for a day trip :-)  \n\nThis really is a wonderful place to come and take memorable photographs with your loved ones/friends.  I'd recommend this for couples interested in a romantic date idea or families/friends looking to get away for the day.",

The space is small, dark, and intimate- perfect for a date night, not so great for a group dinner.\n\nOur waitress was so sweet and accommodating, & happily gave us extra chips and salsa and tortillas when we ran out. She also expertly mixed the tequila we brought with their homemade margarita mix.\n\nTwo of us shared chorizo queso fundido, nachitos and steak fajitas. Loved it all. The queso fundido was SO good- just make sure to eat it all before it cools down. Love that the fajitas come with rice and beans, also. \n\nWe were able to use a Groupon and get out of there for under 20 bucks, including tip.

  "text": "I definitely enjoy eating here and appreciate the service I've gotten. I haven't tried too common items off their menu--my boyfriend and I love fish dishes and salt baked squid, so we usually only order that here. Their salt baked squid is definitely one of the best I've had in Chinatown. We also order the Sea Bass Filet with black bean and hot peppers. This dish is quite delicious--the fish is tasty and the peppers are crispy! We always ask for \"spicy\" and they definitely listen to us. \n\nI also want to rave about their service, specifically one younger male server. One Friday evening on our way out of town, we got a flat tire and had to call AAA. We decided to have dinner here while we waited assuming AAA would take forever. However, they showed up as soon as the food arrived, so my boyfriend left to attend to that. Our server was very thoughtful. He put our food back in the kitchen in warmers so it wouldn't get cold (I was obviously waiting for my boyfriend to come back before eating). He gave us fresh rice as soon as my boyfriend got back. We really appreciated his thoughtfulness! All other times, the service has been decent. It's a small place, so it can get filled up quickly. When it's really busy, we may have to wait some time to get our water glasses refilled, but they definitely do their best to keep up. I definitely recommend this place if you're in the area.",

Everyone gets along with each other even though you might not know them. The bar tenders are super friendly and fast at getting you what you want.

All the specials came with either french fries/salad/clam chowder. Our table decided to share and we ordered the hot sampler and the crab cakes and the calamari as well. The calamari was nice and fresh. The tartar sauce goes very well with the calamari. The hot sampler was okay. There was oysters and had cheese on top. I didn't enjoy that much since the cheese seem to cover most of the oyster to be honest. I enjoyed the garlic clams/mussels though. The clams were super big and delicious. The crab cakes were also another one that was good. \n\nOverall, we had a good time even though the wait was long.

It is never a wait, even when it's crowded.\n\nThe pizza is very very good--always with a lot of vegetarian options and veggie/pesto/fresh mozzarella/artichoke hearts loaded pizza-yum!.  They heat up whatever slices you want in the pizza oven (which at other places can make the crust too tough and the toppings too sloppy, but here it doesn't at all!)\n\nIt's always a good time; with affable staff, good food, and an enjoyable crowd.\n\nPS\nIt's all ages until 10pm (at which point it becomes 21+)",

  "text": "My homies and I did God's work ate four versions of Nashville Hot Chicken in one night (also using a double-blind study aka ate it at the same time on the trunk of a Toyota Prius) in order to determine the best one. \n\nJudges consisted of three men of different races, ethnicities, native languages, and styles of dance. Each person, though, has a strong passion for poultry. And no woman that night wanted to eat with us.\n\nTo control for as many variables as possible, we tried a mild flavored chicken breast at each one. This test did not take into account service, ambiance, and decor, or prices. It also did not factor into the overall ranking. \n\nBolton's sat at second in our ultimate power rankings. \n\nCriteria and corresponding scores below:\n\n*Spice (4/5): Fantastic spice with a lingering yo-this-stuff-sits-in-the-back-of-my-throat kick. Like many other Nashville Hot Chickens, they use a dry rub, but you know the folks in the kitchen let those breasts and legs marinate. \n\n*Meat Juiciness (4/5): Juicy and savory. Almost pornographic. \n\n*Skin (4/5): Crispy, but not the crispiest. It complimented the meat well, but I wouldn't say memorable.\n\nOverall Score: 4/5\n\nOther tidbits:\n- I asked a native-born construction worker ahead of me if Bolton's was his favorite place, for Nashville Hot Chicken. He said, no. However, he recommended their white fish.\n\n- I tasted their white fish, which is sandwiched in between two slices of white bread and mustard, and I would recommend this over their Nashville Hot Chicken.\n\n- The spice level is higher than what most people can endure. I ain't like most people, though. #asianfolkslovethemsomespice\n\n- The service is slow, but so is the rest of the South.\n\n- Feel free to watch NBA basketball on the TV in the corner.\n\n- The toilet paper roll sits super high up in the men's bathroom.",

  "text": "Oooh baby I like it raw! But sometimes a few cooked items are ok when it comes to sushi, and at Kei (pronounced KAY) the menu has that balance down to a science! After two visits, I'll be back many more times in the future! \n\nI've been here twice in the past few weeks, sharing some of Reno's signature AYCE sushi with two visitors to our great city. I'd never been here before, but Shelby B, a trusted Yelp confidant and friend, told me how great they were IRL and in her review, so I knew I had to check it out. \\\n\nOn my first visit I noticed a familiar face behind the bar, Jesus. No. Not that Jesus, but a sushi chef I'd had at another spot. I was excited because I knew he did things right, especially nigiri.\n\nNext I noticed a section of the menu dedicated to \"Specialty Nigiri\"! The salmon rooster and salmon lover were both fantastic. One of them is topped with crispy salmon skin, my favorite ingredient! The Kei Tuna is also no to be missed on this section! \n\nOf course, we ordered some of the standard nigiri, and all of these were perfect. Fresh fish, solid fish:rice ratio, and the rice was also nicely seasoned. The albacore was a little mushy on both visits, so I think I'd just skip that one in the future.\n\nOn the dinner menu they have some really special rolls. Tres Diablos, with pickled jalapenos, was wonderful. I think the biggest surprise though had to be the Great White, with escolar, macadamia nuts, and a sweet mayo sauce. Freaking fantastic. I thought I'd hate it but it has been my favorite thus far! \n\nBe sure not to miss the Alligator, salmon skin hand rolll, and Jason hand roll! Plus, ask your chef for their special! They also have a big section of vegetarian rolls! GREAT JOB! And if you like it spicy, ask for the habanero sauce. But beware! \n\nSo with all this love, why 4 stars? Consistency from chef to chef is of utmost importance to me when it comes to a sushi spot. On my second visit I wanted to wait for Jesus, but was encouraged to sit with another chef. While his maki and hand rolls were good, his nigiri was lacking, and just not as clean or composed as Jesus. \n\nI'm sure they're still getting the staff tuned up, so I bet this will fade over time. They've asked for some honest feedback on both occasions, offering a cool comment card at the end of the meal. \n\nA restaurant that appreciates feedback gets bonus points in my book. Kei, Welcome to Reno! I have a feeling you'll be here a long time!",

Staff as friendly and helpful with all the tech and more to boot! \n\nBathrooms were tidy, coffee was plentiful as were sodas and waters throughout the day, and it's walkable to the City Market which makes taking a tasty lunch break easy to do. \n\nNot just a work space either. I could see this place being the perfect location for a lovely cocktail party or catered gathering as well.",

  "text": "Meh these DQ's are just ok . Really more for the Custard lovers over Ice cream lovers for their Blizzards which they are known for. Location is outdoor seating only on hard wooden benches when available, or take out. Kinda wish this place had an indoor Air Conditioned place to sit and relax on a hot summer day or night but it is what it is. Mostly for families with kids that are fans of this stuff. They do offer hot pork sandwiches hot dogs and a couple other hot items which I hear are decent but why anyone would get a hot sandwich at an outdoors only DQ is beyond me ? For me, I'Il pass on this place and go to Bruster's or Cold stone for real ICE cream on a hot Summer day thanks, but again, I can see where some might be big fans of this place?",

Especially if you like sours. The staff is knowledgable on good beer and very attentive. Prices are responsible. I had a pint of Ballast Point Dorado for $5 tonight. They also had Funky Buddha Last Snow on tap this evening. There is a private parking lot, plenty of seating, music at all times and happy hour during the week. They serve great food especially the pizzas and sings. Watch for bbq specials that are amazing! Dive bar that is somewhat upscale. I love this place :)",

  "text": "Iris is located on a nondescript little stretch of Decatur but the decor is nice, service was outstanding, and the food & drink were very good.  We'll definitely be back.\n\nAmong other things Iris is a perfect place to dine if you're going to the House of Blues for a show, it's about a block away and I'm positive the food is much better than the HOB.  Dinner started with a nice little amuse bouche and then hot homemade bread was brought to the table along with perfectly room temperature salted butter.  Great start.  We then received our cocktails which were very nice and within the fairly large wine list found a great value 2010 Rex Hill Pinot Noir in half bottle format for only $26.  After living in Oregon I have to say 2010 is shaping up to be one of my favorite vintages and even Rex Hill made some pretty darn nice wine in 2010.  Anyway, in terms of the food we started with pasta including the gnocchi which were excellent including some nice spice from chorizo and the squash \"tortelloni\" which would be more accurately described as large ravioli but were house-made pasta with tasty filling in a nice (if overly generous) brown butter sauce.  I love places that make their own pasta & gnocchi in-house so this was a pretty good way to start the meal.\n\nFor main courses we ended up going with a duck confit salad - which was plenty large for an entree - in addition to a duck breast Main course so we ended up with duck 2 ways.  The salad was good on its own and had an entire large confit duck leg on top which might have been slightly too crispy on the outside for my taste but that's just nitpicking, both the duck confit and the accompanying salad were very tasty.  The duck breast was cooked well and very tender but for some reason the dish just didn't have quite as much flavor or textures as I thought it would.  Don't get me wrong, it was still a pretty good dish (which went perfectly with the Pinot Noir) but I was hoping for more of a wow factor on our only Main course.  All of the food was good, but the gnocchi was the only dish with much of a wow factor which is why I have to round down to 4 stars for the moment and see if future visits bump it up to 5.\n\nClearly Iris has a solid kitchen and great attention to detail including some of the better service I've had in NOLA recently.  It rarely seems to be packed so Iris appears to be a nice under-the-radar option in the Quarter for those who might be looking for a last minute restaurant reservation.  I would put it in the genre of Meauxbar and Cafe Amelie also located in the French Quarter which have nice upscale atmosphere and very good food.  That's pretty good company.",

  "text": "My family recently spent a long weekend here. We came in on Boxing Day and left three days later.  This is definitely a family favorite so I'm sure we will return simply based on the fact that we travel with an elementary school age child.  That being said, some things to take into consideration: \nWebsite/Phone registration: Abysmal. The website links don't work and/or take forever to open. I was NOT able to book  a room online.  I had to wait several minutes to get through to someone by phone.  She explained that now that Circus Circus has been bought out, supposedly they need to update their website. She urged me to keep my confirmation number even though she took my email address for confirmation. I never saw one so my trusty yellow Post-It stayed in my wallet until our room keys were received.  \n\nCheck-in: My Yelp Karma was in effect so we got to the front counter within 10 minutes. The bad news was our room was not ready.  In fact, it wasn't ready for three hours.  The woman who checked us in said we would be waiting from 30 minutes to an hour for cleaning to be done. Thank goodness the second clerk who helped us after our initial wait, a gentleman from Nepal, switched us into a different room so we could unpack and unwind.  \n\nBell Desk:  There's no bell but there needs to be one. Maybe I'll bring them one on my next visit. The clerks, able-bodied young men and a token woman, are responsible for manning the valet desk so they putter back and forth at whichever speed they deem it.  Sometimes they chitchat among themselves, oblivious to the stink-eye and side-eye they are receiving from those of us waiting to store our bags. \n\nRooms:  We had been moved into a clean room(see above) and it featured handicapped accommodations(lower racks, a chair in the tub). We were so exhausted we didn't care. The walls are beyond thin. Our first night we had to endure the tween and teen cousins on one side(why do my people always pack the whole extended family into a hotel room like it's a clown car?) of us.  The second night we called hotel security on the young couples talking loudly and drunkenly on the other side of us. \n\nHotel Security: You the men.  That is all.  That pounding on our neighbor's door was music to our tired ears.  \n\nFitness Center: Who is getting fit here?  Almost every cardio machine was out of order. I finally found an elliptical trainer and put the TV(these all work) on \"Ocean's Eleven.\"  There is one weight machine and one small area for abs work. There is a vending machine for water so I was parched(foolish of me to not bring my own.)  They do provide clean towels.  \n\nFood options:  We only checked out the Courtyard Buffet and the ice cream shop/deli. The line for ice cream was long and the battle for a booth/table was brutal.  \n\nMidway:  This is why you come to Circus Circus. Your little one will love the carnival games and all the new stuffed animals they will haul home.  The whole family will enjoy the families of acrobats and trapeze artists and the campy dog shows.  If you plan ahead by taking a photo of the show schedule,  you can grab bleacher seats or stake out a spot to stand in front.  This  is what makes Circus Circus unique. It will make the crowds and lines worthwhile.",

I'm more of an omelet guy, so I ordered the southwest omelet. It was piping hot, loved the cold sour cream and salsa on top. It was also slightly spicy -- it must've been the peppers and sausage inside.\n\nOur server was super fast an efficient, and aside from the home fries smashed into the carpet right next to my chair, the atmosphere was very clean, attractive -- kind of a subdued country home/french cafe feel.\nAlso, FYI, they don't do reservations -- they do \"call ahead seating.\" The only difference I could tell is they don't assign specific time for the reservations. They just make a note that you're coming in and (I guess) adjust accordingly.",

My family and I went to the Philadelphia location for my dad's birthday 1.) because he loves steakhouses 2.) he's a Morton's member and they gave him a $100 gift card.\n\nThe location is great, right off of Broad on Walnut Street, but the interior needs major renovation. I felt like I was back in the 90's in this place, and it just looked tired.\n\nI also don't like that they bring out that cart of raw meat and fish to explain their menu and the specials. First, the whole demonstration took about 10 minutes and we were thirsty and starving. I also don't like looking at raw meat covered in plastic wrap that has been sitting out for a while. NOT appetizing.\n\nMy strip steak was good, but I have to say that the $8 one I purchased at reading terminal and broiled at home was just as satisfying.\n\nThe creamed spinach was excellent compared to other steakhouses like The Palm, and my cucumber drink with St. Germain was absolutely delicious. The breaded shrimp in beurre blanc appetizer was forgettable, as was the chopped salad and asparagus with bernaise.\n\nThey gave us a free molten chocolate cake for dessert and it was terrible. Very commercial tasting. I've had better with a Duncan Hines mix.\n\nGo here if you're on an expense account or have a gift card. Otherwise, patronize local places like Union Trust or Butcher and Singer.",

I ordered 2 crepes; the Batman and Robin which featured fresh fruit and ricotta cheese spread and the Romeo and Juliet which had strawberries and Nutella.  Both were to die for!  I didn't have their frozen yogurt that day, but I will go back to try it.  The crepes are very inexpensive, but they are small, so order a few.  This place has a bit of everything.  You wouldn't think it'd work, but it does.  Crepes and frozen yogurt? Yes, please!  If you're there in the morning, it's pretty quiet, but a load of business men and women come down for coffee, yogurt, and hot cereal.  It was snowing pretty hard when I went, so things were pretty slow that day.  \n\nWhat I really love about this place is the local vibe it has.  You'll notice a lot of pictures on the wall that were taken by the main guy and features all kinds of attractions, monuments, and unique finds right here in Indy.  \n\nThe place is insanely clean and well decorated.

The café's atmosphere is colorful yet calming with ample seating and tables in the front and back with various reading materials (magazines, newspapers, etc.) available for patrons to peruse.

In fact, I ate majority of the ribs without adding any sauce because it was so good just by itself!  Of course, I had to compare it to Pappy's since I think Pappy's has the best ribs, and I gotta say, it's pretty damn close.  It's not as tender as Pappy's but I think flavor-wise it might edge Pappy's just a bit!\n\nAlso a huge fan of the wings here.  It's smokey, juicy, and straight up addicting.  Since we were sharing the wings, I was so tempted to go back and order some more, but the long got really long :P\n\nAs for the sides, everything we tried were great!  The deviled egg potato salad is very unique.  First time I've had both potato and egg salad together.  The baked beans are smokey and sweet, and the BBQ pork skins was like eating crack.  For the pork skins, aka pork rinds, one of the guys working there told us to use the vinegar-based sauce with it and holy, it is good.  The pork skins are seasoned with seasoned salt so it's like eating pork-flavored salt & vinegar chips!  Awesome combo.\n\nI think I still like Pappy's ribs more just because I like fattier cuts of ribs, but BBQ restaurant as a whole, Bogart definitely beats Pappy's any day.  Pappy's sides can't even compare to Bogart's and Bogart's menu is just more fun and adventurous!  No wonder it was rated the #1 BBQ spot in the US by Zagat!",

They were all really well balanced, but I'm also an IPA lover. There were beers on tap that were not IPAs and they also had wine for the winos our there.\n\nWe went into the main area where you can see the beer being brewed and they had added a lot more games and picnic benches since they had first opened. They had board games, air hockey, corn hole, you name it. We played corn hole for the majority of the time we were there.\n\nWhile they do not serve food, you can always have it delivered to you there, which is a nice touch.

I drove by this building for several months and saw the \"Opening in May\" sign; I wondered if it would possibly be another antique store and wondered why anyone would want to open ANOTHER vintage store around here, but alas...I came in today and was proven wrong!\n\nIt's a cute little soda shop--okay, it's more of a sweet tooth shop, but they do have a variety of 'vintage' sodas/pop/coke. They have lots of yummy sugary sweets for those who like to indulge. They have cookies, ice cream, and of COURSE candy! One cookie that caught my eye was their 'Root Beer Float' cookie. WHOA. Unfortunately, I did not indulge in any of the sugary goodness as they are all dairy products (trying to be as dairy-free as I can here). I did have one of their old-fashioned Coca-Cola's though, hah.\n\nIt's definitely worth stopping in and looking around. They have lots of little goodies to buy, so if you need a pick-me-up or you need to buy someone an 'I'm sorry, please forgive me' candy bag, go here.\n\nAs for the decor, the walls are a lovely robin's egg blue! They have vintage chairs (acquired from the Franklin Theatre) that have been re-upholstered and vintage-inspired tables, as well as lots of other vintage-looking furniture. The music is pretty diverse too; just while writing this review, I've heard Buddy Holly, Grease, and now Cobra Starship. Whoa. Oh yeah, and they played 'I Want Candy'. HAH.",

  "text": "I am a huge fan of deconstructed salads. The traditional \"chop everything up and put it in a bowl\" is great, but when fresh ingredients are laid out you have the option of creating your own bites. So my salad dreams came true at Muriel's during a recent brunch over the Salad Midi. Huge juicy tomato slices, avocado slices, and a tangy pile of frisee topped with the best champagne salad dressing I've ever had. I wish I had one right now!\n\nI combined the Midi with a tasty cheese porky torte, and the combination was a lovely light lunch. And the bread, dang. I could have eaten the whole bowl, but luckily I have some self restraint :)\n\nThe decor here is really nice as well. The front rooms remind me of a classic home-dressed up but still inviting. As you head toward the back by the bar and the bathrooms, the lighting gets softer and the decor gets more ethnic, and its gorgeous. And the service was amazing--we dined with a six month old, and the waiters treated even him like a little king. I've had some really fantastic meals in New Orleans over the years, and this was definitely among the best. I can't wait to go back.",

  "text": "If smoke is your thing, you'll find just the right BLEND here.\n(See what I did there? :-} )\n\nBlend is a lovely space located between Keystone at the Crossing and Castleton in the Clearwater Crossing area of North East Indy.  I actually didn't expect the space to be as large as it is.  Upon entry, I was surprised by how non-smoky the atmospheric air was inside of Blend.  \n\nFor the record, I'm not a smoker, and did not partake at Blend.  It was great to see that the space was as warm and welcoming to a non-smoker such as myself in addition to all of the cigar afficionados present.  If I had to put a label on Blend, I'd call it:  Giant Man Cave - But Classy.  Leather furniture and dark wood dominate the decor at Blend, and a gentleman wearing a red velvet smoking jacket wouldn't look out of place at all.\n\nI was only able to give three stars, as I found the service at Blend a bit lacking.  The waitstaff did not seem as efficient as I would like, and there was a considerable time lag between placing orders and receiving them.  \n\nMy only regret is that I didn't get to explore the humidor; I hear it's grand.  If you're looking for a cultivated smoke, or just a quite place to catch the game, Blend might be just the place for you.",

  "text": "This is a lovely space for a spa.  I booked a massage here and the prices are very reasonable.  They have a nice repertoire of massages, and a bamboo massage that is unique to this spa, I believe.\n\nWhen you enter it is a full salon atmosphere, so it seems a bit loud for a spa.  The spa seems like an add on upstairs, but thankfully it is a more serene environment.  I love the library of books and magazines here.  They also have a nice selection of product lines and special prices.\n\nI like the upstairs, which is a bit quieter and has two nice lounge chairs to wait for your treatment.  The locker room is a bit small and when I was there, the steam shower was not working.  I enjoyed my massage with Lauren.  This is a nice spa to book treatments but I wouldn't consider it a day spa where you can lounge the whole day.",

  "text": "My visit here was my first time ever eating at Bob Evans. All of my friends love it there so one morning I finally had the opportunity to go. The experience was pretty average. Not over the top fantastic, but definitely not the worst dining experience I've ever had either. I LOVE breakfast and I was super hungry, so I wanted something that would offer a lot of bang for my buck. Unfortunately, we had to wait longer than normal for a waitress, but she came she was prepared to answer all of our questions and made good recommendations so that we could have everything we wanted for the cheapest price. She was also very friendly, almost to the point where it did not seem authentic, but I won't complain. At least she wasn't rude, right?  Anyway, I opted for the Homestead Breakfast which included two eggs, choice of meat, choice of potatoes, two biscuits and gravy. I also chose to have my potatoes loaded. The meal was very filling and tasted pretty good. Again ,not the best breakfast I've ever had but definitely good and at a decent price for everything included. I also had coffee (of course), and it's always a plus when a restaurant offers flavored creamers. Way to go BOB! All in all it was a pleasant experience and can see myself visiting here again.",

Service remains at top notch and food is phenomenal. My favorite remains the lobster escargot dish. This place used to super upscale but now its a perfect mixture of upscale with an out doors sports feel. It's the best of both worlds. \n\nI recently took my son here for his 12 birthday and he absolutely loved it. We got to sit in the inside area with the window view an enjoyed half of the yummy sushi menu. \n\nYelp check in hooks you up with a free domestic beer.

  "text": "We just left after getting to the restaurant 40 minutes before closing. Food was great, as usual, but I will NEVER return. When the clock struck 9pm there were still several tables eating, as per usual in ANY restaurant. So here is how they handled it...\n1. They started bleaching tables next to EVERYONE while wearing blue rubber gloves. \n2.  When finished with each table they stacked the chairs on top. \n3.  This one is PRICELESS: They started a gas operated pressure washer INSIDE and when we asked WTH? we're told it was 'cleaning night'!? \n\nThe fact that they couldn't wait for ANYONE to finish a meal. Literally 10-15 mins, is ridiculous and I hope they close. I am SO tired of being treated like the customer no longer matters in SO many places. Really, really sad.\n\nOLD REVIEW:\n\nI am SO happy Yummy House South opened!! Not only can we get great quality Chinese food during the week (including my favorite salt & pepper seafood!) but on Saturday and Sunday we get push carts of dim sum! Really the best thing that's happened north of Kennedy in a long time! ;-D\n\nWhen we arrived, we were 20 mins early and worried that we were wrong about the time - not a car in the lot??? Then, within 10 mins, there wasn't a spot available! We were seated and almost right away the carts started coming out. The only thing I can say is I was in heaven! \n\nAt first, the steam cart only had about 8 items, but within 30 mins it had many more. Anything we felt we were missing, however, we just asked our server and he brought it out straightaway from the kitchen! Service was impeccable!\n\nDon't miss a weekend of dim sum for something different! It's the best! If you go in the evening and the parking lot is full, the bank next door isn't towing...at least they weren't when we parked",

  "text": "Rode's is an interesting little roadhouse (no pun intended) just north of the small New Jersey town of Swedesboro.  I was just looking for a quick bite to eat before turning in for the night and the place looked pretty inviting.\n\nThe interior of the restaurant is dominated by a large bar filled with patrons having drinks and a bit of something to eat.  Off to one side there are about a dozen or so small tables.   We were promptly seated and presented with an impressive looking menu,  a variety of appetizers, salads, sandwiches, and entree's made up of beef, poultry and seafood.  Very impressive menu for what appears to be a roadside restaurant.  I ordered the roasted tomato  bruschetta, a cup of french onion soup and a salad wedge, my companion ordered a seafood platter which which was made up of breaded shrimp and a crabcake.  I initially ordered a Yeungling beer and then tried a Port Road Pumpkin Spice Ale (A Budweiser product).  The roasted tomato bruschetta was very good, there was a strong taste of garlic and the tomato added a nice sweet taste to the appetizer.  The baked french onion soup was flavorful and rich, although a bit heavy on the cheese, which made it kind of difficult to eat.  The wedge salad was loaded with bleu cheese and bacon bits.  My companion loved her breaded shrimp but she thought the crab cake was a bit undercooked.  Not sure how that could happen.\n\nThe Yeungling beer was fresh and smooth, the Pumpkin Spice beer was crap to put it bluntly.  Should have stuck with a good thing.  For two people the tab was about forty dollars.  One thing I noticed, even though the place was three quarters full, the noise was at a level where you could hold a normal conversation, not loud and noisy like some places.\n\nAlthough there is nothing on the menu that could be considered exotic, I found Rode's Fireside a fine place to eat and would gladly go back.",

We went here a couple of months ago, and I've been jonesing to go back.  \n\nWe went on a Sunday for brunch...certainly not recommended if you're in a hurry, but we knew we would have to wait.  There were 5 of us, and it was difficult to huddle together and chat while we waited.  This shouldn't be a problem in better weather as there's a nice outdoor area, but it was freezing the day we went.  The result was that we paired off a bit until we got to our table, but there were yummy baked goods to ogle while sipping cocktails to placate us in the interim.  \n\nThe vibe here is hipster haven.  I found the staffs' many handlebar mustaches charming considering the restaurant is in a repurposed bike repair shop.  Everyone was very helpful and courteous especially considering it was standing room only.  Everything on the menu sounded amazing.  My initial order was a bust as they had run out of it, so I opted for the grilled cheese (walnut bread with cranberries).  Gourmet comfort food!  My husband had pork cheeks or pork belly and loved it.  Clean plates and happy faces all around!",

Medium still had a lot of heat, although I'd be interested in trying the hot. All 4 of our sides were delicious. The mac n cheese and greens were my favorite!

My favorite Italian dish is eggplant parmigiana, and these guys prepare it exactly the way I like it.  A lot of restaurants in the area are Creole Italian.  Typically those restaurants have a red sauce with some spicy heat, so if that is what you prefer you might find the sauce bland or uneventful.  I love it, it's very tomatoey.  The eggplant is melt in your mouth tender, bursting with flavor without a hint of bitterness that you find at lesser establishments.  Prices are reasonable for what you get.  Expect bread with your entree, some delicious olive oil and balsamic vinegar are set on the table to enjoy.  Come hungry and these guys will take care of you for special occasions.",

  "text": "My quest for the best roast beef poor boy in the world finally led me to Domilise. I had been wanting to visit for some time now, but the universe always conspired against me. Once I was heading there for a poor boy when work called and I had to turn around. Another time I pulled up and saw a line outside the door. The last time I tried they were closed. This time I was lucky and found them open, and not very crowded.\n\nAs Shannon so accurately described the interior, the place is a dive. To me, that is a great thing. Even the men's room is a dive where you have to stand on a wooden pallet to use the urinal. The run down, old look adds to the ambiance and lets you know you're in a neighborhood joint, not some purpose built fancy building.\n\nThe roast beef poor boy comes with creole mustard when you order it \"dressed\". This is different than most other poor boy shops and they made sure to let me know in advance. The poor boy was good, but didn't wow me. It was far superior to some I have tried, but fell short when compared to others. The sandwich used the correct bread (there are giant Leidenheimer bags on the wall when you enter), had a good gravy/meat ratio, but I think the creole mustard may have detracted from the sandwich. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love creole mustard, but I may have found one thing that I don't particularly like it on. Even if I had ordered it without the mustard, I don't think my rating would have changed. It was good, but for my tastes, I've had better.\n\nIn summary, Domilise has a good roast beef poor boy. While not the best I have had, if you're in the neighborhood and want a roast beef, give them a try.",

  "text": "Exquisite! Artistic!!\n\nI have been planning to visit this place for a while now. Yesterday, I finally got chance to check out the place with my boyfriend. I am so excited to share my views on this place. There is so much to say!! :D\n\nAttractions: \n\n- First thing you will immediately notice is the interior designing of this place. It is just beautiful and so welcoming. The owner took so much time to make every corner of the place feel like home, that you would want to come back here over and over, just so you can enjoy every part of this place :) \n\n- The 'giving wall' : This is a family owned business of Laura and Scott Burton. They have 8 children, who selected 8 charities for donations. Whenever anyone purchases a bottle of wine from here, 50% of the proceedings go to one of the charity. The buyer can select which charity in particular would they like to donate. \n\nWine: \n\n- You can pay 10$ for 5 tastings of your choice of wine.\n- You can just go ahead and buy the bottle.\n- You can join the Peace Posse and get free tastings.\n\n\nI went for the 10$ tasting, since this was my first time. I am a big time red wine lover!!! I chose two reds, namely, Sublime (2014 Pinot Noir) and Passion (2014 Cabernet Sauvignon); one ' a rose by any other name..' namely, Inspire (2014 Dry Rose) and finally two whites, namely, Bliss (2014 Sauvignon Blanc) and Soulful (2012 Oaked Chardonnay). \n\nWOW! My top favorite was Passion, followed by Bliss and then, Sublime. I didn't know I could love white wine too, until I found Bliss!! Hahahahaa!! Amazing. The service was so good. Our server gave us detailed information about each wine we picked.\n\nOh how much I love this place!! Can't wait to come back and purchase the Passion bottle and enjoy the place :)\n\nPEACE OUT!! :D",

  "text": "First trip* So happy to have this place in our neighborhood.  A bit hard to find at first glance, it located right next to community center.  Small inside, but clean, bright and jamming to fun tunes.  Friendly staff.  The food- so yummy!  The chickpea tuna salad was flavorful, and I really liked the dill dressing.  For the \"crab\" Mac and cheese, they use heart of palm instead of crab and lots of other veggies cooked in too.  Big Easy bowl was generous portion.  And to top it off, bc of wait, they served us a free portion of their special- spinach and artichoke dip.  It was awesome!  Lots of spinach and I think the sauce was made with coconut.  Yum!   \n\nWent back for more* update!  Now serving on normal plates instead of disposable and I've got nothing but love for this place now!  Started with drink of the day: Activated charcoal lemonade, aka black and gold lemonade.  (Who dat!)  It tasted like normal lemonade, perfectly sweetened (I'm picky, don't like super sweet stuff) and reportedly healthy way to remove toxins from gut.  She's not playing here;) I also had mushroom poboy and it was so good.  Sadly I didn't have my phone to take pic, but trust that this thing is massive. Loved that it was served on leidenheimer bread which is a fave of many locals, myself included.  Warning if you are trying to be healthy, the mushrooms fried.  For those that like fried food- know that the chef does them right: lots of crispy flavorful golden battered oyster mushrooms. The spread/dressing and spring mix bring it all together for perfect lunch.  I was again impressed with their super friendly service and good music.  Also like that there are two main community dining tables, so eating there feels a bit like shared family style meal. Thanks y'all!",

  "text": "I found out about this awesome seafood shop from a few friends! They usually rave about the Hot Sausage or Fried Shrimp Po Boys, so I just had to check them out. It's a small corner store on S Broad and you will have to find street parking around the area, but it is definitely worth it! When you walk in, there are two tables on the left side, a register in the middle, and a line of glass door fridges with beverages on the right. When it came to order, the lady was really friendly and treated everyone with utmost respect! I really feel like it's hard to mess up a Hot Sausage Po Boy, so I opted for their Fried Shrimp Po Boy for my first visit. I wanted to see how they made their Po Boys and what made them so special. When the food was ready, the order was announced through an overhead speaker and you can pick up through a window right out the kitchen. \n\nThe food came out fast and hot! I unwrapped my Fried Shrimp Po Boy and instantly took a bite, something I never do because I always feel the need to take pictures of my food. I got excited because I saw that they used Hi Do French bread, my favorite French bread for Po Boys! The shrimps were average sized, not too small or too big. They were lightly battered, so I could taste the shrimp. There was the perfect amount of lettuce and mayo, so everything really went well with each other. I enjoyed every single bite I took out of the Po Boy and I understood why my friends were raving about it! \n\nI came here a second time to try out their boiled food items and wanted to show a friend the amazing Po Boy I had last time. The lady helped me out again for this visit and was nice as ever! I ordered a pound of boiled crawfish and their combo bag, which included two cut potatoes, a spicy sausage link, a boiled corn, a pig's foot, and long turkey neck. It was a really good deal for around 6-7 dollars! The boiled crawfish was delicious and had a good spicy kick to it. The potatoes and corn were the usual that you usually get at other places, but the corn wasn't boiled with the crawfish pot. I loved their pig feet, it was cooked perfected and had great flavor! The turkey neck was huge and I had to get a to go box to take home to eat later!\n\nOverall, this place is awesome and I definitely recommend everybody to make their way here to eat some good crawfish and Po Boys! The service is always friendly and prices are very affordable!",

If you drive around the back, they have a small lot and you can go in through the back door.\n\nThe owner was working at the counter. He was very friendly and informative.  He gave us a sample of their Venetian Cream drink that is his specialty. It was very good. I love when places let you sample the drinks first.\n\nThey have plenty of tables indoors, as well as a small back patio. Beyond the patio, there is even a backyard with chaise lounges and a hammock between the shade trees!\n\nGreat place! I'm sure I will visit again.",

Our food came out quickly and I could tell it was good because the only people talking in the entire restaurant were those people who were finished eating. \n\nThe burgers were delicious and the garlic fries were amazing.

I kept telling my girlfriend and a friend of mine how one if these days I'm going to try this place. Well, last night was one of those days as I was in the area and decided to stop. \n\nHave to say, I really loved it there. My girlfriend and I split a cheesesteak and fried pickles. The cheesesteak was very high quality and had very good taste. I felt the steak on the sandwich was a higher quality than the other notable Philadelphia cheesesteak spots. The roll was also very good which overall made the sandwich a home run. It was also cheaper than the other places as well. \n\nThe fried pickles were very very good. The pickles were the chip type and they had a lot of breading on them. They were bigger than usual and very crispy. I have been thinking about them all day.  \n\nThey have a very big menu so next time I stop we are going to try more stuff!\n\nTip: They don't have a bathroom, so don't come on a full bladder. They also accept credit cards, which I found quite convenient.",

  "text": "My wife and I went here for our First wedding anniversary dinner, and it did not disappoint. We had never been here and quickly learned that people will travel a long way to eat here. We also realized that this is not a place to go eat on the regular as it is very pricey, but we knew this going in and were not too worried about it because of the occasion. I made reservations on OpenTable and mentioned it was our anniversary. When we were seated we were given a small card wishing us a happy anniversary, signed by the staff. We thought this was a nice touch for our experience.\n\nWe began our 4 course meal (they explain Melting Pot is typically enjoyed as a 4-course experience) with our cheese fondue, we chose to make our own with a local 4Hands City Wide. We thought the beer we selected actually reduced our enjoyment of the cheese and we probably would have been fine taking the 'classic' option. When you make your own, they use a small amount of the beer when melting the cheese and the table then gets to enjoy the rest of the bottle/can. \n\nSIDE NOTE- Since there was only one cooking station at our table, we had to agree on the style of cheese as well as the style for the entree phase of your meal.\n\nWe also ordered from their special wine offering, a 3-pour sampling of wines with a complimentary cheese board. This came out with our cheese fondue and it was quite enjoyable.\n\nThe caesar salad we both got for our 2nd phase was very good. We felt the portion size was appropriate related to the amount of food we were getting in full.\n\nOn to the main entree. This comes out raw and the cooking style you selected (we chose Mojo) goes into a new melting pot, from there you are given some tips on how long each should be cooked in the pot. This ranges from 1-3 minutes. You are given a variety of sauces as well, and all of those are fantastic. After your server leaves, you are left to drop your food and fish it out after it's done. All-in-all it ends up being a fun part of the meal. We were incredibly full at this point but we were assured we would find room for dessert.\n\nFor our chocolate fondue, we decided on the milk chocolate, with caramel and toffee. WOW, this was surely the best part of the meal. We absolutely loved our choice and actually discussed the possibility someday of coming back just for dessert it was that good. The fruits were fresh and the other sweet treats tasted great with the melted chocolate. I checked in on Yelp and received a free premium dipper. You can choose to get this for an appetizer, or dessert. We obviously chose to get the dessert version.\n\nWhen we were all done, our bill ended up being the largest we have ever seen for the two of us. But we expected this so it was not a problem. This is not for a casual night out and you could tell by the way the servers were asking every table if something was being celebrated.\n\nWe did have one problem at the beginning where we waited almost 25 minutes to be seen by our server after being seated. I am not sure what got mixed up but after I let someone know, they were there right away. The GM also came out and apologized for our wait, and we actually got our wine tastings comped for the inconvenience. The delay gave us some time for check and recheck the menu before ordering so it wasn't really a big deal. But I know that would really bother some people. I am confident that does not happen often, and I really think there was just missed communication when our table was handed off from the host to the server. \n\nI would give this place a recommendation if you are celebrating something special for sure, or if you have money to blow on a fun dinner out.",

Cheap lamps, picture frames, mirrors, you name it. Their downstairs marketplace is where it's at! Though I admit I do spend too much money on junk, at least it's fun to do. \n\nI vastly prefer this one to the Conshohocken one. It's surprisingly usually less crowded. Also it honestly is more nicely laid out, and you can even see a rapidly rusting ship on the river from the cafeteria window. Food is alright, not gourmet but at least an experience. Their food market though has a lot of prepackaged interesting stuff. Those damn Swedes certainly know how to make pastries.\n\nTime and time again I find myself here, and usually it's a pleasant experience. Just avoid the weekend crowds and you'll be golden. Sometimes I hate admitting I love Ikea.",

It is only 5 dollars ( es you read that right, even the fish over rice is only 5 dollars)! Cash only :(\n2. The fish is actually some of my favorite fried fish I have ever had. Perfectly seasoned and crispy on the outside without being dry on the inside. \n3. Chicken and lamb are also dope, but not as good as the fish\n4. Sauces are a perfect balance of flavor. I just get everything when I go there.\n5. Service is fast and portions are large, it comes with the drink.\n\nWhat are you waiting for?

Every dessert is done well here from their insanely good cookies to this Ny crumb cake. The ny crumb cake has a slightly crunchy crumb crust with a sour cream infused cake . You don't really taste the sour cream and it's their to provide moisture. The cookies are among the top 5 I've had in Clearwater and a must try.

  "text": "Nita's place has firmly landed in my current top 3 places to eat in the Clearwater area.   Wow.....Nita is an incredible cook!\n\nNita used to be the cook at Nearly/Really Famous Tampa Style Cubans just down the road, and in fact their menu still features the \"Nita's Sloppy Mojo Pork\" sandwich in her honor.  I'm not sure I've ever seen such a tip of the hat at any restaurant to a cook that has gone into competition.   While the menu at Nita's is very close to the current one at Tampa Style Cubans, I've found her flavors a good notch higher.  \n\nLooking at Nita's menu, you can read the history of her restaurant/family background.  In conversations with her, there's hardly a cuisine she hasn't cooked....Cuban, cajun/creole, Italian, Mexican, Chinese, on and on with lots of red-blooded American, good ol' home cooking fare for good measure.  She's always happy to bring you a sample of anything on the menu to check out...very cool.  And make sure to ask her if she's cooking anything off menu (as she often does).   Last visit I forgot to ask before I ordered, and when I finished eating, she brought out a tray of stuffed green peppers to try out after already stuffing myself with a platter of jambalaya.  They looked fantastic, but I was about to pop already, so I'll have to catch them another time.\n\nNita's is a one-woman show, she cooks, runs the register, and serves customers...quite the juggling act but she pulls it off well.  Even though there are only about 20 seats, it may mean there's a bit of delay in checking out, but at the end of such a great meal, you won't likely mind.  Note this:  Nita's is a very simple diner...very utilitarian and nothing fancy.  I'm not inclined to call it a dive because it's cleaner than my favorite dives.\n;-)\nI've tried a good number of items on the menu, and so far my favorites are:\n\n-  Cuban sandwiches - great!\n-  rice and beans - delicious\n-  moho pork - outstanding\nand finally\n-  jambalaya - a must try!  Outstanding, best I've had in Tampa hands down, available as a plate or bowl\n\nI haven't been able to get there for breakfast but the biscuits and gravy are on my list next time I'm in the neighborhood.  Prices are reasonable, with daily specials from $4-7, entrees $5-7, and three sizes of sandwiches (4-8-10\") from $3-7.25. Soups, salads, and sides round out the menu and make sure to ask what cake/pie she's made fresh for dessert.  Takeout is also available.\n\nAfter my first meal, Nita asked if I liked it and I told her I would sleep in the booth if it meant I could eat there every day.  My second time the food was so great I asked her if I could hug her (she gladly obliged, grinning from ear to ear).  Last visit I took my Mom there and she fell in love with her and her cooking, too.  I told my Mom I'd adopt Nita if I didn't have a Mom already.  I think she knows I'm kidding, but hey, Mom is getting up there in age...Ha!\n:-)\n\nAtmosphere:   3\nService:   5\nFood:   5\nValue:   5",

We waited a bit for a table and when we got seated we got the ditziest waiter imaginable. Fortunately there we were still near the bar and near where waiters went in and out so we could catch someone to help refill our glasses etc. as other reviews have stated it. Gets really loud in here. I didn't notice it at the bar but when we we were seated it was tough to hear. \n\nAfter thoroughly reading the Yelp reviews I ordered the goat tacos to share as an appetizer and they were good but kinda small. I ordered the mussels which were good but nothing to write home about. Sadly the best food I tried there was a friend's side of grits, damned they were good! My friends were disappointed in the small portions of food. \n\nSo I would definitely recommend this joint to grab a nice strong drink at the bar and to hang out there. Not so much for the food.\n\nHappy drinking!",

I just ordered a holiday special \"Snowball Mocha \" (I think).  Marshmallow melted on to of the hot coffee, it is rich but the bitterness of the coffee underneath it just make the coffee perfect (although I am not a big fan of marshmallow, I think this combo makes them perfect together).\n\nI had a chance to stepped inside and it is such a cozy welcoming coffee shop.\n\nGive this little place a try.

After merging onto I-75 north bound I quickly got up to speed, it was a little before 9:00 PM and traffic was moving a little over 80 mph and all three lanes were still congested from rush hour. This highway is a good example of what I dislike about this side of the state, I guess if I was retired and didn't have to venture out during the morning and even rush hours I may consider moving here being I love the gulf waters over the Atlantic side.\n\nJust as I settled in for the ride I realized I needed to fuel up before crossing the state so I exited once I saw the sign for this station. The exit is not lit and with pouring rain it can be a little difficult to maneuver when exiting at a high rate of speed. The first curve forced me to scrub most of my speed but I had to immediately get back in it to cross the (3) lanes while merging to get all the way left to turn into the station - note to file this seems to be a popular spot for the \"Road Ranger\" (sponsored by State Farm) I'm not sure what the attraction is but I did notice (2) during my short visit maybe \"donuts\"?\n\nI don't know how old this Racetrac is but it's very clean and the fuel prices were competitive. Getting in and out is very easy and the parking lot and fuel Islands are well lit. It's doubtful I'll ever become a regular here but I'd stop in if the opportunity presented itself again...",

  "text": "Milk House is one of my go-tos for delivery. They are fast and affordable, even when you consider delivery fees/charges. My usual is the caesar salad with rosemary grilled chicken. It's a huge salad with tons of chicken and it fills me for the entire day. The dressing is delicious and there is always a nice amount of parmesan. \n\nI have occasionally ordered some of the other salads and they are always very fresh and tasty. I did have a botched order once when I ordered the signature salad and it arrived without bacon. How did they forget the bacon?! \n\nI'd love to try the grilled cheese sometime but that would require a planned splurge - they sound amazing and also amazingly fattening! I'm so glad Milk House sees all of its customers and provides quality food for everyone at an affordable price!",

A few kinds of infused vodkas and several different juices offered and lots of garnishes including some fresh large shrimp!  \n\nService was fantastic- truly - without a doubt- even our waiter told us how much he loved working there- you can feel that vibe.  Comfy outside couches and tables, intimate private room next to a glass enclosed wine vault.  Gorgeous décor - cosmopolitan yet casual.\n\nThe food we tried was really delicious.  I highly recommend the shrimp - even for a nonseafood lover like myself I would go back and order it again!!!  The crème brulees were great- but try their churros with a trio of sauces!!!  The prime rib was cooked perfectly - definitely a winner!!!",

So we get on yelp and see what's nearby.\nI would have never picked this place because it is just off the main road and in a strip plaza with an auto tire shop and a music center.  \nLooks are deceiving.\nThis place is a gem!!!  \nItalian and Greek came together and had a baby and it's called Romanos Restaurant.\nThe palm ceviche was chunky bits of hearts of palm, grilled shrimp...so so good...radish, grilled pineapple...o.m.g. it was good.\nI then had the bruschwtta and salmon and honestly it was very different bruschetta but I'm down for new things....so so good...the salmon was cooked perfectly...the chicken parm was to die for good...the sauce was perfect and it had grilled tomatoes in it that I fell in love with.\nThe Baklava was probably the best I have ever had.  My guy had never had it before and the ice cream with what I think was crushed pistachios was the best compliment to it.  They also had a Ukrainian layered cake but there was no way we could have gotten two desserts.  I was full when I left.\nDanyelle was our waitress and I'd like to give a shout out to her!!

  "text": "The Bar Louie girls -- the high school group of six -- decided to celebrate our second anniversary of getting together by going back to Bar Louie -- where it all started!\n\nThree of us got there 30 minutes \"early,\" so we speared a lovely rounded booth facing all the TVs. Got water, reviewed the imbibement list and took a little minute to decide.\n\nOur server (We kept calling her Susie, but then explained to her why we called her Susie, and she got a hoot out of it.) was just spot-on with the leisure and flavor of our table! I wish I could remember her name, but she was absolutely delightful and extremely attentive.\n\nTuesday is $1 burger night. Well, you gotta know the $1 burger is lettuce and a bun -- it says so explicitly on the menu. No arguments from us readers!! You want cheese, bacon, mayo, grilled onions, raw onions, tomatoes --  anything else -- it costs extra!! For the most part, additions are 50 cents extra. Mayo is 25 cents extra.\n\nThe dollar burger menu encourages you to order a basket of fries or tots. Ask how much that costs -- 'cause it ain't $1. We asked. And we asked how many that basket would serve.\n\nOK, here's the rundown: one basket of fries or tots costs $4, and it serves 2-3. BINGO! You got the picture.\n\nWe started out with a cone basket of calamari with its lucious ketchup-horseradish sauce. It was wonderful. I wish we'd ordered two.\n\nThen we were on to the burgers. Everybody got exactly what they ordered, brought out by the \"kitchen\"? Not sure, but he was fabulous. And we got a basket of tots.\n\nBy this time our sixth attendee had arrived, and she was giving her burger order to the kitchen guy. He was taking it all in, but then Susie was there, so she took over. Great service!!\n\nAnd we ordered another basket of tots. There's just something about tots that reminds me of childhood. And, yes, tater tots were already invented when I was a child. (So was fire.)\n\nThe burgers just hit the spot! Great buns, a good-sized patty with nice beef flavor and a reasonable amount of lettuce. Add a little ketchup and a lot of mustard (both free), dig into the tots, and you gotta a great meal! I added Cheddar to my burger, so it was a $1.50 burger. There were four cheese options: Cheddar, Pepper Jack, American and Provel (I think).\n\nThat second basket of tots was HOT-HOT -- fresh out of the tot-maker!! Yum!! The six of us did not finish that second basket.\n\nA fabulous evening with good friends, good food, good service!",

  "text": "For my 1100th review, I review the iconic Muriel's Jackson Square, one of the loveliest restaurant/event spaces in New Orleans. I first attended a wedding here on Halloween 2010. My two fabulous friends pulled out all the stops and had an amazing horror movie-themed wedding where Jason and Leatherface got things started with a bang (er, a chainsaw). Sure seems like the folks behind Muriels worked well with my friends and the wedding was an occasion to remember. We were upstairs, where private events are held, and took breaks from the main room in the bordello-like seance room. One of my favorite things about this night included hanging out with cocktails on huge balcony overlooking Jackson Square. \n\nBy the way, if you're dining here and there isn't an event going on, you're free to go upstairs and check all that out. You can even have a drink and bring it up to the Seance Room (and I strongly recommend that you do, if you like rooms dripping in red, chandeliers, velvet and brocade. It makes me want to decorate my entire apartment in a similar fashion). \n\nRecently I came to realize that besides the gorgeous environs, the restaurant serves up some really great food and drink. My friends and I had lunch here recently. We were seated in the room where they open the huge glass doors to the sidewalk so you can watch passersby and listen to music being played out in Jackson Square. \n\nAt lunchtime, they offer $4 Bloody Marys, wines and martinis. I indulged in a Bloody Mary, as I am often wont to do, and found it to be quite satisfactory (garnished with olives, pickled green beans and citrus and served in a pint glass. No skimping here just cuz it's a mere 4 bucks). \n\nI ordered the modestly-named Vegetable Plate. I'll be honest and say I wasn't expecting much because I've had many a pedestrian veg plate where they barely even marinate the vegetables before skewering them and grilling. Booooring. \n\nI'm thrilled to report that Muriel's Vegetable Plate belongs in the Vegetable Plate Hall of Fame. First of all, it contains braised kale. Almost 'nuff said there, but I'll go on to say its flavor is just so so so very good. The other star of the plate is that compact square of polenta flavored with herbs and Parm cheese. Everything is so delicately placed, which I love, and nothing overwhelmed with oils or heavy sauces to \"make up for\" the fact that you're eating a plate of vegetables. There's a delightful little bit of everything from beets to parsnips to tender shittake mushrooms. A healthy, hearty plate. Thank you, Muriels! I seriously could not stop thinking about it all day.\n\nThey also have a gluten-free menu.\n\nI think I'll be dining here on the regular when I have visitors in town. It's just the perfect place to take them when they want the quintessential French Quarter dining experience.",

The only possible drawback is not actually a drawback - it's too popular with both Mexican and non-Mexican Philadelphians.  But the service stays always super friendly no matter how many people are trying to crowd into its small space.\n\nThe tortas here are in my opinion the best in Philadelphia.  The accompanying sauces are awesome and all are homemade from the Chipotle to the Salsa Verde to the eponymous Mole Poblano.

A friend pointed out the fact that the ice was handled by a young man wearing no gloves and pushing the ice into the 'sno' machine. He was sweaty and itchy which resulted in him scratching himself all over and wiping off his sweat with his bare hands followed by handling the ice and pushing it in the machine. The counter was a mess and seemed like there was no real order. The staff had to run back and forth between the rooms to grab different flavors. I guess they are trying to change little but it seems that things would run more efficiently if small changes were made. I have been to other sno cone shops in the area which are cleaner and more sanitary. I guess people down here are so fond of their childhood memories of this place that they fail to notice these small details. If you don't care about hygiene then you will love Hansens.",

The interior features brightly colored walls and lots of windows that fill the space with natural light during the daytime.\n\nThe interior can quickly become noisy during prime dining times so keep that in mind when deciding whether to dine indoors or outside.\n\nSome of the chairs had seat cushions but not all. Not sure what the rationale is behind that but your behind may appreciate a little extra cush beneath the tush so select your seat wisely.\n\nThe menu, true to its backstory, focuses on foods featuring citrus, seafood and smoke. The prices seemed a tad on the high side but the dishes served were definitely well prepared and well presented.\n\nThere was a bit of confusion regarding my order but what I was served in its place was definitely tasty and worth a ordering again if, and when, I visit again. \n\nThis would be a great spot to meet for a drink and have an appetizer while watching the sunset but not sure it would be a regular stop for lunch. \n\nDefinitely would recommend to anyone who has not yet tried it, especially to guests of the hotel as well as others visiting the area for fun or for business.",

I settled on splitting a order of disco fries which was essentially fries covered in gravy and cheese. It was pretty OK but to be honest, I would've much rather had my fries drenched in gravy and cheese because I love heart attacks on a plate.\n\nThough I didn't order any beer, the selection here was sweet so I'm definitely looking forward to a round 2.\n\nI really liked the lighting and set-up of the place- overall, a great atmosphere for food and drinks.",

I got the BBQ pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw and mac& cheese for the sides... HOLY MOTHER OF PEARL. SO GOOD. \n\nPRO TIP: You better wear some stretchy pants to this place or just unbutton your jeans! The portions are huge and the food is so good you will NOT want to stop eating lol. To be honest I didn't LOVE the coleslaw (but I'm a coleslaw snob). The BBQ pulled pork and mac & cheese were mouthwatering, I wish I could've gotten seconds because it was THAT GOOOOD. This is a must if you're ever in Nashville. And it's on a side street away from the crazy crowds so you're not jam packed next to people. The entire staff is super friendly and there's unlimited seating inside + outside. Check it out, you won't be disappointed!!!!",

But in this case, I don't think it's unhealthy, and I believe I'm right to covet that which I am denied on many occasions. \n\nI love Cuban cigars. And Cuban rum for that matter. And because of some age-old grudge, which really no longer f*cking applies, I can't get them in the U-S-of-A. And it annoys the ever-loving shit out of me. \n\nSo every time I travel outside of the US, I find my way to a tobacconist and score (not with my money, if the US government is reading this) myself some of the finest hand-rolled tobacco to grace the face of this earth. On a recent trip to Canada, I found my beloved brown beauties at Burlington-on-Whyte, which stocks an impressive collection of vintage, regional and specialty selections. \n\nThe staff at Burlington are incredibly friendly and helpful, willing to provide suggestions for those of us who don't know the whole Cuban portfolio, since our stupid and outdated governmental policies won't allow. Of course you'll pay a pretty penny for this selection and knowledge - prices much higher than I'm used to forking over for similar product. But these babies are well-kept and cared for, and sublimely curated, so that probably does add some value.  \n\nThere's nothing quite like the buttery deliciousness of some fine, island-grown hand-rolled cigars.

They have a private nook in back that was perfect. I really appreciated their attention to detail. \nWe started with the bread & butter. The 2 butters were full of flavor & the fire grilled bread made for a good beginning. \nNext we shared the Duck Pastrami Salad. Almost went for the Beers but my wife is a sucker for Brussels Sprouts & we were both thrilled. The individual components were varied & each quite tasty but gathering a single bite containing all was exquisite. On a side note - neither of us are duck lovers but the pastrami was a revelation. \nThe main took a very non-traditional detour (for us) in that we opted for Beijing Chicken & Big Night Pie (a vegetarian dish) setting them between us to share. \nI'm convinced some voodoo magic was employed to get chicken that crispy & cooked through while remaining light & juicy. The marriage of sauces was fantastic & I could've eaten a plateful of the dim sum.\nThe cheese in your first bite of pie bursts forth in your mouth evoking the very best memories of every time you've eaten cheese. As an Aussie I appreciate savory pies more than most & will gladly eat this again. \nI can't forget to tell you that YOU MUST get the Vegetable Potato Salad for a side. If you've never had warm crispy potatoes in a salad you'll thank me. If you've had this, or it's very near kin at Etch, then you know exactly what I'm talking about.",

This was exactly the relaxed vibe I was looking for as a way to start my week. Although I spent most of my time sitting and eating outside, I was invited in by the owner and Manager who collected my info for seating. He was immediately able to sit me outside! Drew, Gage and the Manager truly made this a great and welcoming experience for me. They each checked in on me frequently but not in an overbearing way. I absolutely love a staff who has an awareness of customer needs all while they are working so hard to meet the needs of other customers. Additionally, the food here did not disappoint. I order the fried chicken sandwich that came with collard greens on top. Flavorful would be a complete understatement. That sandwich was SO good that I ordered a side of greens after I was finished with my meal. I mean, does it get any better than this? I'm so happy to have found a location that is well kept, that follows covid-19 safety regulations with seating customers, has impeccable customer service with food that keeps me coming back for more. See y'all soon and thanks for a great experience!",

  "text": "Chicken pot pie.  It's an All-American comfort food that just screams your name (\"Allie!  Allie!  Allie!\") on a cold winter afternoon.  We'd just finished up a movie at the Riverside theater and I popped over here to get something warm and filling.  For $11, I got the chicken and mushroom pot pie which was just the perfect size (not too big, not too small) AND a very generously sized salad that came with Gorgonzola cheese, walnuts and sliced apples.  The decor was simple but inviting. Loved the music - a little bit of Michael Franti, a little bit of Bob Marley, a little of the Nappy Roots (hey, give me credit that I even KNOW who the Nappy Roots are).\n\nThe only downside was the service, which is provided by kids who are coming out of the foster care system.  After waiting for at least 10 minutes, no one came by to bring water or take an order.  Finally got up and went to the  cash register. No one there. Peeked my head into the kitchen and finally got someone's attention.  So perhaps a bit more training and a suggestion to be a bit friendlier and warmer to customers might be helpful.  Maybe the kid was just shy and new.\n\nPRO TIP #1:  Only saw the sign as I was walking out, but if you like them on Facebook, you get a free beverage.\n\nPRO TIP #2:  Parking on the street is free on Sundays.\n\nPRO TIP #3: Validated parking in the garage on First St. by Silver Peak. \n\nPRO TIP #4: They sell their Pies Take and Bake for those nights when you just need a little comfort!",

  "text": "It is seldom that I am underwhelmed by a tiki bar. But I have to say, overall, I was not that impressed with this one. My bf and I stopped in one night and ordered a drink to share, as we were already getting a little soused. The bartender looked disinterested and bored, and did not crack a smile or engage us in any way. He had the personality of a piece of cardboard, which is not typical of a tiki bar at all. I have yet to go to one and find such a surly welcoming committee. \n\nThe bar itself is actually very lovely, and HUGE. I think it has a bit too much space, given how empty it was when we walked in. But who knows? Maybe it gets busier over the weekend. I am not really sure. It is, however, well-decorated, and about as tiki-fied as you can get. Bonus points for the decor and seating. They also have an interesting spin-the-wheel game, for those who can't decide what to drink. \n\nThe next night, I visited once again, and the bartender that night was much more engaging and friendly, cracking jokes and bantering with the patrons sitting at the bar. The only downside? They were out of the liquor gummies I wanted to try, and they were also out of their house-aged rum they use to make their strong Mai Tais. Oh, well. The drinks he made for us were good, though. Made up for the experience the night before, anyway!",

However, that didn't stop me from eating some, and DOSC was the best introduction to the Albertan beef culinary scene I could've hoped for. \n\nLocated right in downtown Edmonton, DOSC has got that classy but unpretentious vibe that I really dig. Beautiful open space with rustic furniture, wood beam ceilings, slightly steampunk feels. I love it. Fantastic place to grab a craft cocktail or a great steak, which is exactly what I did. \n\nVisiting from Toronto, I cannot get over how much steak I can get for my money. A beautiful 10 oz dry-aged ribeye for $42...that's better value than the Keg! And obviously so much tastier. The juicy steak was perfectly medium rare, sitting on a fluffy cushion of garlicky pomme puree. Also go the Oxtail Poutine which was great with fresh fries and savoury oxtail meat but the real star of the show was the Brussel Sprouts. The large size was big enough to share between 4 and the sprouts were perfectly crispy, a little citrusy and a little sweet. We added pancetta to it and it was absolute perfection. Great recommendation from our server, who was also superb! \n\nIf you're looking for a great place for a date, or just craving some good meat, DOSC is the place to go!",

You can tell this place is a favorite because there was a line before they even opened, and everyone was ordering food for dining in plus more food to go. The man in front of us ordered something like 30 tacos plus another couple for himself to enjoy in the dining area. I wanted to crash whatever gathering he was catering! Or steal his lunch for the next five days. \n\nI give four stars because I personally loved Lilly's more. Don't get me wrong... the flavor of the food was excellent. I know why there is a line now. It's personal preference. I did appreciate the condiment bar at Lilly's. The one at La Super was more limited in options. The dining area isn't large enough to accommodate the crowd that comes to this place, but maybe that helps keep courteous people making their seating available as soon as they've finished. \n\nI encourage you to give this spot a try though!

  "text": "When in Nashville for a holiday weekend, I had originally intended to trek over to Marche for a leisurely Saturday brunch. At the last minute, I recalled that I had driven by Thistle Farms a couple of days prior and my dining companion had said how much she wanted to try it out post-renovation. After checking out some Yelp reviews, I suggested that we forego the longer drive to (and inevitably longer wait at) Marche and give Thistle a go.\n\nGREAT decision.  It was easy to find a parking spot in the lot behind the restaurant, and it was so inviting stepping into the bright, spacious, sunny space.  When you visit, look up.  Above you is a seriously cool teacup installation, which is a cool contrast with the somewhat sleek and un-fussy decor.  In front of you there is a sign directing you to grab a menu and then proceed to the register to order in this fast casual establishment.  Menu was enticing with a lot of tasty sounding salads, sandwiches, sides, and staple brunch dishes like quiche and a breakfast bowl.  At the register, we were engaged in friendly conversation, affirmation of our good choices, and then we took our number and proceeded past a tasty-looking pastry display to find a good table.  \n\nA few minutes after finding our way to a very comfortable communal table (there are private tables and booths, too - in more than one dining room), our server brought along our order.  I had the Bombay Avocado Tartine which was honestly the best avocado toast I have ever had.  And, let's be real, I live in NYC and I'm not afraid to admit that I'm a little basic and I've had a LOT of avocado toast. It was the perfect blend of spice with fresh herbaceous microgreens and cucumber and a very flavorful drizzle. It was great with my little pot of tea, and was supremely fresh.  My dining companion had the farm-fresh breakfast bowl with eggs, potatoes, some greens that she said tasted as though they had just been plucked from the earth, etc.  She also had the London Fog and said it was a very good take.\n\nNearby, there was what seemed to be a bridal or baby shower, and we commented that this would be a good place for a party, a ladies who lunch date, an actual date, or even to come do work - a welcome break from the Nashville coffee house scene. Everyone who worked there was so friendly, stopping to say goodbye before we headed out, and it's really a wonderful mission that I was happy to support.\n\nDefinitely stop by the shop on your way out - I left with some lovely citrus body butter and some other cool odds and ends.  I hope that Thistle Farms Cafe gets the traffic that it very well deserves!",

The decor is not really my style either. But I have two words for you: TUNA DUMPLING. I would seriously walk to New Jersey to order the TUNA DUMPLING.\n\nUh, so best thing to do is look at my picture, but it's basically a faux dumpling that looks like a soup dumpling but instead of a dumpling skin, the outside of the dumpling is made out of tuna. The inside is a combo of creamy crab and something crunchy... panko maybe, I don't know. It is served on a plate with two sauces -- a sweet hoisin type sauce and a creamy wasabi sauce. Combined with the tuna and crab it is deeelicious. It's something I truly crave. Like I seriously could just come here and eat two of these and call it a day.\n\nOtherwise, we generally like the sushi. Loved the Halloween roll this last time. The Cha Cha Roll was OK, my hubby really liked it. Also like the New York handroll, with slices of green apple. Sunday and Monday sushi is 30% off. TUNA DUMPLING.",

Otherwise there are plenty of hiking trails throughout (watch out for the bikers-they come in fast but always announce themselves). \n\nThe area is super dog-friendly and has great views. I love coming in the Fall to see all of the leaves change. Tons of great places to go eat/drink nearby after (I love going to wissahickon brewery!). \n\nThe only drawback is the lack of parking.",

Brought my bike with me from California and my first ride was to ride the 6-mile loop around Forest Park. Love that there is both a gravel and paved trail to accommodate wheels and feet. I've cycled this park in snow, rain and sunshine and always come away feeling peaceful. This park has a special place in my heart.",

If you are a male or female, young kid or teenager, there is something for you.  Even the wonderful pets in your life have a place to shop.  All the jewelry and purses that girls love and the make up and all that good stuff, it's there.  Lastly, all that stuff that you buy at the touristy places, souvenirs, etc, yep all here.\n\nI am excited to have gone here. I feel like it's one of the biggest flea markets with everything in it, not just the same ol stuff at each stand. My favorite was the tiki guy who makes tiki bars. They have so much detail, of course they cost and arm and a leg, and I don't know if people actually spend an arm, leg, and whatever at a flea market, but hey it was really cool!\n\nCheck it out! I think it's good for one of those rainy days when you want to do something but don't want to stay home. I always feel like when it rains, I have no idea what to do since it's always sunny in FL. \n\nP.S. You can bring your doggie!",

  "text": "Why 5 stars? Because it successfully helped with me severe case of missing-Hawaii-itis.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nAfter getting married in Hawaii a month prior to this writing, we've been visiting every Hawaiian restaurant that we can find in Tampa Bay. The Honu is definitely one of my favorites so far! I ordered the Manu Kea & Keck I & II, which is a long way of saying beef, spinach and rice. The beef had a phenomenal flavor to it, and despite its basic nature, I really loved it and could eat it every day.\n\nFor dessert we shared a couple of things: the macademia nut ice cream and this cookie crumble thing that was served inside a glass. I was really glad we ordered these two things together because they complimented each other nicely. If I had to pick a favorite, I'd have to go with the ice cream.\n\nAs for the vibe of the Honu, they definitely did a great job of making you feel like you're actually in Hawaii. If only we could add some mountains in Dunedin, we'd be all set. We sat outside with our dog, and they even brought him a meal of chicken and sweet potatoes for $3. If Moose could type, I'm certain he'd be offering a 5-star review as well.",

  "text": "I really wanted to give this Chili's a higher rating, because it really was a mixed bag of good and bad.  Unlike many other reviewers, we had no problems with the service.  Our waitress was friendly, helpful, and efficient.  And our Southwest Eggroll appetizer was great.  But they always are.\n\nThen we got the drinks.  The Margaritas were very good, but my wife's Cosmopolitan was not well made at all.  She thinks it had way too much Triple-Sec, but she didn't like it.  And as I've mentioned before, she tends to judge a restaurant by its Cosmos.\n\nWe went to Chili's because I was in the mood for Fajitas.  I had the Chicken/Carnitas combo, and they were very, very good.  I love the way it looks, the sound of the sizzle, and the aroma coming off the pan.  But I was the only one happy with my dinner.  My wife's tacos were stone cold by the time she got them.  My son's steak was very underdone for him.  I like a very rare stake, but he's more civilized than I am. \n\nMy daughter was very disappointed with her Margherita Flatbread.  It was downright soggy.  Seriously, why would they do that?  She is a vegetarian, and Chili's does not have many vegetarian-friendly menu items.  The Margherita Flatbread has always been her go-to at Chili's, and this experience may just guarantee that we'll never be back.  \n\nAnd I will sure miss those fajitas.",

Our server gave us a warm greeting and tried to upsell us on some mimosas (it was just too early for us to start drinking)... took us a minute to make a decision, but our server was more than patient in our indecisiveness. \n\nMy boyfriend and I both ordered omelettes. They were ok. I wasn't feeling the carbs, but my bf said the potatoes were good! When the food runner brought our food he asked if he could get us anything else, and then immediately brought it to the table, then asked one more time - I loved that & SOOOO appreciated it! This way we weren't waiting for additional condiments while the food got cold.\n\nHonestly, the food was ok. But the service is really what made it a good experience for us.

Its more of a one stop casino, resort, spa and dinning desination. \nWe love to come and take advantage of the beautiful pool area in the warmer months. They have two large pools, plenty of deck area with loungers and seats. And great poolside service.\nThe restaurants are all fabulous with great food that is plentiful. They offer fresh baked  pasteries and desserts, gelato and specialty coffees.  Most times my husband and I split plates. They have an outstanding prime rib french dip in Biscotti's.  Bimini is a top notch steakhouse with really unparalleled service. And huge martini drinks that they fill to the tippy top. Over by the Sports Book they have a deli with a new york style ruben and pastrami on rye. Even the sauerkraut is fresh made with hints of sauted bacon. \nThe rooms are spacious and well appointed. I love the smell of the bath products. \nWhen we stay at Peppermill we actually never need to leave. I love all of the screens and photos from all over the world. Its fun to sit in a quite spot and literally watch the world go by.",

In New Orleans, this would be called \"Creole-style\" and \"Cajun-style\"-- order a variety of what they offer and you'll find that much of it tastes the same, and the seasoning and depth of flavor is just MIA.

However, what makes this beach so awesome is how accommodating it is for dog owners. Yes, it's a dog beach! But how many dog beaches have designated dog-leash and off-leash sides? And a dog washing station? (It's not free though)\n\nIt's great for dog owners and dog lovers (just cause you don't have a pet dog doesn't mean you can't love them am I right). The beach is also clean, although there was a little too much seaweed for my liking. Overall, it's a good beach to check out!",

The cheese actually STAYS on the pizza and doesn't rip everything off when you bite it although it still stays nice and stretchy. The breadsticks are very nice, chewy just like I like them.\n\nBefore I get into specifics, the only reason this place is a four star because of the price. Being a middle class citizen with a humble income, the prices are a bit high, so I only come here on special occasions. Starting off with the pesto, very zesty, and right amount of herbs. Meatlovers is the best, no other words.\n\nJOCKAMOS IS THE BEST! Friendly services, good food, but a little bit of a high price.",

The staff provides a fun and friendly attitude which adds to the charm. Food service here is limited to popcorn, however you can order from the Frankly Sausages food truck which is located outside Thursday-Saturday evening. I highly recommend the Mary's Little Lamb, you can thank me later.\n\nAs far as the beers go I was pleased with everything on the menu. My recommendation is to not try just one of two of their delicious brews but try the flight, that way you can sample them all. Personally I preferred the Irish Red with Honey, it was perfectly balanced and satisfying beer. However much to my surprise I really enjoyed the Irish Stout, and that says a lot considering I am usually not a fan of stouts in general, it had the perfect balance of flavor and a slight hint of chocolate.  Kudos to their brew master for introducing me to a stout that I finally love! Other two beers were the Session IPA and the Bavarian Hefeweizen, both were very refreshing.\n\nSix Mile Bridge is a great new addition to the St. Louis Craft Beer scene, I recommend stopping in and trying a flight!",

Now if you come hungry get a full plate yourself but if you're just looking for a snack you can share with another person. I love the scenery it's legit rock and roll. The menu looks like a record and they play rock and roll on the TVs in there. They've been low on staff so they may move slowly but as quickly as they can. You'll probably get your food faster ordering to go. You'll be parking behind or on the side street prior to getting to rocknroll, I usually find a park so it's not really something to stress about. If you like sushi you'll enjoy it, if you don't like it, go give it a try. I'm not a fan of sushi, wouldn't be my first choice but I loved this and I've been back plenty of times!",

The food was okay - not mind blowing, not bad, okay.  Neither of my kids like the beans which is weird because that's usually they're favourite. \n\nWe came on a Tuesday... but no Taco Tuesday specials in sight.  The special of the day was mojitos and I most definitely enjoyed a cold one of those made with love.\n\nOur server was friendly and knowledgeable. \n\nthe kiddo special (quesadilla) was a hit with mom and dad but not the kids.  My kids must be broken. \n\nOverall, we left satisfied but not really wanting to come back for the food.  As mentioned by other reviewers the decor is awesome and the ambience perfect.  Unfortunately, the food just didn't hit the spot with any of us.  \n\nIf you're looking for authentic delicious fresh Mexican, I'd highly recommend Calle Mexico on the North Side just a hop and a skip out of downtown.",

  "text": "Ice cream in December? When it's OwowCow, the answer is always a resounding YES. \n\nThis place prides themselves on their locally sourced product. Everything is made or procured locally, and it really makes a difference. Sure, you're going to pay a little more for a cone here, but you're supporting multiple local business and getting a delicious, organic treat that's free of the extra garbage corporations will add in. It is SO.WORTH.IT. \n\nThey are always trying new flavors, so you can easily try something different every visit if you'd like. The kids behind the counter here are super friendly and will happily give you a tasting of any flavor before you get stuck ordering something and don't like it. \nThey are peanut free here, which is cool for all the peanut allergy folks out there. \n\nLet's just say, I don't think you can go wrong here. The house vanilla is still my favorite, but I also have not been disappointed in any other flavor they offer. They have a ton of topping choices as well- my fav being the chocolate \"chips\". I don't know what planet these hunks of shaved chocolate would be considered chips, but they are the perfect pairing for the vanilla. \n\nBunch of fun cone options here too. Waffle cones with fancy dipped treat edges- from cookie pieces to candy bits. I usually just go with a cup because I can't finish the regular size on my own, but if you want a challenge, go for the waffle. \n\nThe fridge at the counter is also full of local drinks, pints of their ice cream, and various to go treats depending on the day. They offered ice cream pies and ice cream sandwiches on my most recent visit before Christmas. \n\nOwowcow, I love you. I wish I could pack you up and take you home to South Carolina with me!

I enjoyed coming here way more than our first night at Felix. The oysters were bigger and better (you can see them shucking away in the corner). It was here that my husband felt that the chargrilled should be a bit more done, but I thought it was perfect. Maybe because of my love for raw ones, so hey no harm done. \n\nWhat helped me decide on going to Desire instead of other restaurants that night was their offering of crab mac and cheese. It looked so good and the photos and lives up to the hype! I can also see why it's an appetizer instead of an entree - it's a lot of bites of the same creaminess that you might want to share with others instead of eating it over and over. My husband got the fried oyster and shrimp poboys - pretty good too. \n\nOne star lost since they were out of a lot of ingredients for their signature drinks. I guess with the Clemson/Alabama fans and NYE, visitors depleted the city.",

The kitchen was slow with preparing our food to come out simultaneously but we entertained ourselves with toasts & speeches to the bride & groom. \nThe glazed chicken wings & Caesar salad were good. Those who ordered the Alaskan salmon all agreed including myself that is was a bit dry & lacked seasoning, but the kale & quinoa was tasty. However those who ordered the pasta dishes stated that they were delicious (cajun pasta & lobster & shrimp mac n' cheese) & will order it again. For dessert we all had the triple chocolate brownie topped with vanilla ice cream & we all loved it. \n\nThanks Gordon Biersch for making this a memorable event for my brother, new sister-in-law, & family.

But for an all you can order/eat type establishment I was very impressed. But unlike places like CiCi's and other pig trough buffet lines where pizza primarily bakes under lamps until it gets refilled, the concept here is more fun and unique. Order a pie or two, or three... etc. And they will bring it by your table and ask how many slices you want. You can take as many or as little as you want. But the fun part is that pizza keeps rolling by your table from other tables orders hot and fresh, so you really never need to leave your table to try different varieties of pies. What goes through the dining room uneaten gets put on the buffet line for people to graze if they wish. They have an eclectic assortment of pies with funky ingredients and they also let you create your own. And the best part. The dessert pies are simply sinful! If you leave this place with an empty unsatisfied belly, you're just not doing it right!",

  "text": "As a Cuban American born and raised in Miami I have been searching for an authentic Cuban \"cafeteria\" style restaurant since I moved to Tampa 7 years ago. \n\n7 years. That's how long it took for me to find Maikel's Kitchen. Since I stumbled upon Maikel's Kitchen two weeks ago I must have eaten here about 10 times, and each time I have dragged a friend or friends to eat this God-sent food that has been cooked with abuela (grandmother) like-love. \n\nI have had all the types of rice, the ropa Vieja (pulled beef), the bbq pork ribs, picadillo (ground beef), the Cuban sandwich, media noche (midnight) sandwich, pulled pork sandwich, steak sandwich, smoothies, and their Cuban style pastries. \n\n\nLet me be the first, and most bold, to say that Maikel's Kitchen has the VERY BEST Cuban Sandwich in ALL of Tampa Bay (yes, better than West Tampa Sandwich and Bodega). The folks claiming the Cuban was not good, also described a Cuban sandwich that was not authentic. Therefore, what they were looking for is not a Cuban sandwich. \n\nEverything about Maikel's Kitchen is authentic. From the moment you walk in to the moment you walk out. \n\nNot only is the food AMAZING, but the prices are unbeatable. A Cuban sandwich goes for $4 and change, and a full meal will not run you more than $15 and will be enough to split with someone else or save for later (I can EAT, and I can't ever finish the meal on my own.) \n\n\n\nAnyway, I'm so excited they are here and hope they are here to stay. They are now running with the best Cuban Food Crown. \n\nPictures to come. \n\n\n- an excited Cuban Kid from Miami.",

  "text": "Amazing attention to detail and customer service!\nAttended a private event here recently and felt right at home. We were able to hang decorations, confirm dietary preferences and set up a dessert station all before the guest of honor arrived. From the moment we were seated, we were offered beverages, given fresh baked garlic knots and dishes flooded with olive oil and roasted garlic gloves that melt in your mouth like butter.\nThe food just kept coming and only after I thought I may have to roll myself home did I stop to breathe.\nRound one began with heaping bowls of spinach salad, then juicy meatballs covered in gravy with extra side dishes of gravy, and handmade arrancini balls, with.... you guessed it, more gravy!!!\nWe elected to choose our individual entrees and a friend and I swapped plates to share  the mushroom ravioli and chicken over mashed potatoes with asparagus.\nThose raviolis though! Just when I thought I couldn't get one more mouthful  down, in anticipation of dessert (we provided -and I was determined to eat) I'd take a bite of the ravioli and a chunk of perfectly cooked mushroom rich and early would explode out.\nLucky for me I only had a 2 hr meter so I had 2 mini breaks to run and re up the meter and digest.\n\nCute, quaint, delicious and byob- go try it!",

  "text": "I don't get people to go here enough -- the rooftop area is phenomenal, and probably unbeatable in Old City, and the whole menu and bar is very classy. I've been here for some drinkery and brunch. \n\nFor happy hour, loved it. Doesn't get crowded, and at least in the early spring, we were able to bring a large group to the roof deck. Quite a treat! For food, the one meal I had there was brunch (no drink specials for brunch, by the way. Scandalous!) and the quinoa salad was quite good.\n\nI was a bit disappointed in the lack of vegan options ... but I was mostly put off by a clueless server. When I asked what was available that would fit a vegan diet, I swear she looked at me like I had three heads and basically betrayed that I might have been the first vegan she'd met in her life (as a server in Philadelphia? this I find hard to believe). I'm happy to explain \"vegan\" after 11 years, but the treatment was quite odd. This coupled with an incorrect bill the last time I came for happy hour ... I have my doubts ... \n\nStill, it hasn't put me off ... I'd probably come back for a happy hour that turns into \"maybe\" dinner to try the menu again, and maybe have better luck. One of those places where even when it disappoints me, I'll probably keep coming back.",

  "text": "This place was a pleasant surprise. From outside it looks like a cute little restaurant, but it's much bigger inside. We came for a holiday dinner party. We were seated in a side room that had a TV, a larger party like ours, and two smaller parties. The room was pretty spacious. \n\nThe spot:\nGreat vibes. As soon as you walk-in, you're immediately greeted by the host. Welcoming and friendly. It was a Friday night at 5pm, the place was already busy for happy hour. This would be a great spot for happy hour, one of the few spots that has a Monday-Friday happy hour from 4pm-6pm. This is a fun bar for groups, an intimate dinner, or cocktails with friends. I would recommend this spot to anyone looking for an overall good time. \n\nService was excellent. Our server (forgot her name) was attentive, helpful, and very friendly. \n\nThey offer private dining rooms for larger parties, such a great option for a holiday dinner party! \n\nThe food:\nYou had me at gluten-free pizza crust. I'm always in search for the best gluten-free pizza crust in town. And I thought I found my favorite, but I have now found the winner! There is no comparison! The dough texture is very similar to regular crust, soft just not as fluffy. The taste is spot on and doesn't taste like some of the sad bland gluten-free pizza crusts you'll find at other local spots. Gotta love a pizza straight out of a wood fired pizza oven. It is literally the BEST! This is exactly what I want in a pizza crust, since I can't have gluten. Local pizza joints should take note of Liberty's pizza crust! Just WOW! It's that good! It was a $3 up charge, but it was definitely worth it. \n\nOkay, I'll stop drooling over the pizza crust and move on! I got the Fun Guy Pizza, it was exactly that, a fun pizza full of tasty flavors. The Pesto Cream is to die for, the mushrooms added a subtle salty flavor, the pine nuts added a great crunchy texture, and the truffle oil brought all of the flavors together. I added potatoes to the pizza, they were thinly sliced and added a little crunch. Hands down, one of the best pizzas I've ever had! \n\nThe other two popular pizzas at my table were the Bee Sting and the Apple Pie. Both equally delicious! If you're looking for a sweet, salty, spicy pizza....both of these options are the jam! What sets these pizzas apart is the 72 hour fermented organic dough, fire! \n\nWe ordered some appetizers and we were so glad we did. The Cauliflower was magical, basically melted in your mouth with the garlic and chili oil. We also ordered the Meatballs, these were a huge hit at the table, they couldn't be consumed fast enough. The sauce, the flavors, the texture, all tasted homemade. Wood roasted beets were delicious...honey thyme goat cheese, pistachio oat streusel (gluten free), and a smoked orange sauce. Just amazing! \n\nThey have a really great menu and offer something for every palate. They have some great gluten-free options, just be sure to ask your server before making your final selection. \n\nThe drinks: \nHello spicy Margarita! It was perfect! There was a poblano spice to it which made the cocktail so addicting. I would highly recommend it. They crafted some really fantastic cocktails, definitely a bar that creates innovative and delicious cocktails. \n\nSadly, I didn't get to take too many photos. I was so overwhelmed with all of the delicious food and drinks. All you really need to see is how great the pizza looks. Haha! And you'll just have to visit this spot to experience all of the amazing eats and drinks. Don't sleep on Liberty Food & Wine Exchange, it's that good!",

  "text": "Cajun Seafood was one of the only places that I hear you can get decent crawfish during the off season. For those that don't know crawfish season is during spring. Most places in the French quarter do not sell any crawfish after the season ends. I was pretty disappointed for my trip because I do love crawfish. So when two uber drivers told me to come here we made the journey. \n\nBeware this is definitely not in the tourist part of the city and I would not come in the evening nor would I do anything over than take out. This is just based on me evaluating my surroundings and taking a warning from my uber driver. But on to the food. The crawfish was $5 a pound and u could add potatoes and corn for 50 cents a piece. I got 2 pounds which was not hardly enough. I read things that said crawfish are much smaller in the summer so maybe during the spring 2 pounds would have been plenty. Be prepared for the spice because they were pretty hot. The corn was too hot that I couldn't eat and the potato was hot but not overbearing. \n\nThis place also acts as a seafood market you can get crabs and shrimp as well as some varieties of fish. They also sell beer, juice and soda. All in all I can say if I ever came back to NO during non crawfish season I would definitely return",

  "text": "We've been seeing Dr. Hadley for almost a year now. He's a great dentist and very personable, but the wait time for an appointment is atrocious. Just for a regular cleaning, I had to wait 3 months for an appointment. I was sent an email, as well as told by staff, that they were hiring another dentist and hygienist to help accommodate clients, which made me quite happy since I was considering leaving. Well I just had an appointment yesterday with the new dentist, who was real friendly, but when I went to make an appointment for my kids I was told their soonest would be over 2 months out. That's kind of ridiculous. Also I've had problems with staff submitting paperwork to my insurance company. I had asked for specific charges instead of estimates and was told that wouldn't be a problem but it would take a month to hear back. I've NEVER had to wait that long at another office but didn't make a big deal about it because I figured we had plenty of time before our appointments. Fast forward to the week before our appointment and I still hadn't received a phone call. I called their office and turns out they never submitted my paperwork and my husband's was in pending limbo. The staff would not call my insurance and my insurance said they couldn't approve charges until they heard back from the staff. Luckily my insurance company was willing to call them while I was on the line and push it through quickly seeing as how our appointments were coming up soon. That was a headache and a half! Sorry, Dr. Hadley, but your office needs to get it together. I'd love to stay but I think my family and I will be looking for another dentist soon. Shorter wait times for an appointment might fix this as well as competent staff.",

The most important thing in my book? He was honest - one of our carpets was just not going to be able to be saved - he told us this upfront because he did not want to charge us for a job that wouldn't work - he enabled us to make a decision as the homeowners and really seemed to value our hard earned money.

  "text": "Sometimes you're staying in an Airbnb in New Orleans that's a little less comfortable than you'd like (read: a broken water heater and a bachelorette party next door). Sometimes you find yourself craving the sweet, sweet predicability of a good hotel room (read: temperature control of the air and water sort, housekeeping, etc etc). Sometimes you book yourself that good hotel room and fall into a state of vacation bliss (read: Ace Hotel New Orleans). \n\nI've been to the Ace in Los Angeles and Palm Springs, but only as a lady who drinks next to the pool and never as an actual hotel guest. I love each Aces I've been to and how they're designed with regional decor. The NOLA location features many nods to the city itself, with lots of lush plants, a classy Southern bar, and cool antique glass bottles. The staff here is incredibly friendly--hey were flexible with us and offered late check out, plus watched our bags for a bit after we checked out and explored the neighborhood. \n\nThe rooms themselves are truly wonderful--comfy, stylish, and equipped with anything you might need. I absolutely loved the SMEG refrigerator and amazing assortment of snacks and drinks. While I don't usually indulge in the minibar, having my favorite wine + Zapp's chips within arms distance was too much to pass up. Make sure to try on the comfy bathrobes--you'll never want to take it off. \n\nMake sure to grab a drink or bite in their restaurant, Josephine Estelle (awesome cocktail list) or lobby bar. The rooftop pool is a must stop--grab your aforementioned bathrobe and head upstairs for a dip and a drink. There's a beautiful Stumptown coffee shop attached to the lobby for your morning caffeine fix (their almond milk latte was fabulous), plus lots of awesome restaurants in the area (we loved Willa Jean for brunch at Seaworthy for dinner). If you're in the mood for shopping, check out Freda, Friend, and Defend New Orleans, three awesome shops on Ace's block. \n\nWhether you're a hotel snob or just looking for a rad place to crash, Ace Hotel New Orleans is THE place to do it. We will absolutely be back soon!",

I picked to create the teardrop or raindrop shape.\nYou get to select your very own colors for your design, which was great! They make sure it's all cleaned up for you to pickup next day or to be shipped.

  "text": "After an afternoon cafe con leche or dinner in nearby historic Ybor city, I highly recommend a visit to the Tampa Theatre. This historical landmark brings you back in time to days long gone, but believe me, this place will leave a lasting impression on you. This place is hands down the coolest and most romantic old theaters in the U.S. \n\nThis is a magical place that I always loved as a kid, and so did my parents about forty years before me. As you make your way to the Theatre the first thing you notice is the old-time sign in lights atop the entrance. Then, as you make your way pass the ticket booth your eyes begin to take in the interior, which reminds me of an old Spanish hacienda. Then the main room is something to behold - continues the Spanish hacienda or Mediterranean theme, but the audience feels like they are sitting in the courtyard of this estate. You look up to the ceiling and there it is, the night sky with stars, some of which flicker in the distance. Highly recommend to sit in the first row in the balcony to take in the scenery and the movie. \n\nIf you happen to be in town when a good movie is playing here, take the time to visit this place, you will not be disappointed. Please note that this Theatre was built in 1926, so the seats are not the most comfortable and the sound system is a little behind the times, but who cares, you will still enjoy the experience.",

I was pretty happy that Latitude 29 opened in the Bienville - I like having options and while I like Tiki Tolteca (practically next door) a lot, I dig Latitude 29 in a whole different way.\n\nFirst of all - the tiki drink recipes are classic and meticulously researched by Beachbum Berry, who is probably one of the world's experts in tiki drinks. (No kidding.) This means that these cocktails are strong, have amazing ingredients and taste even more amazing.\n\nSecond, the food menu has something for everyone. The apps price point is perfect ($5-11) and the options are great for someone wanting a small nosh with your cocktail. I love the pineapple bread and the dumpling burger. For the mains, the loco moco is a great option, as is the burger or the steak frites.\n\nSpeaking of the steak frites - it is only $15 during happy hour! What a deal! (There's also drink specials and I am partial to the Odin's punch.)\n\nThe bartenders here are pretty cool - not snooty and actually pay attention to you at the bar.

It's available in like a dozen flavors, and I love having the variety to choose from. \n\nIf you can't come up with 4+ people who want to go here and drink Belgian beers and eat mollusks and frites, get the large frites and be exciting with the 3 sauces you get to choose. I prefer the roasted garlic aioli (you'll dream about it), the pesto, and I'm trying to make my way through the rest of the list one at a time. \n\nBrugge brews their own Belgian-style beers and also serves other craft beers on draft and in bottles, including sours and lambics which can be hard to find. They offer bottled small-batch sodas too and a pretty decent wine list. \n\nWait here can be long, and I'd say the menu definitely lacks that \"something for everyone\" quality. If you're not into crepes, swiss-ish cheese, sausage, or mussels, you may find yourself out of luck. There is nary a burger to be found. \n\nKids are allowed downstairs and on the patios. Upstairs, in the bar area with common seating, expect to be sharing your table with strangers and keep in mind you order from the bar. No kids allowed upstairs. There is a TV both bars and they're usually showing soccer.",

  "text": "Being the person who lives in Philly and loves to try new restaurants, I waited WAY TOO long to come to Zahav. Well, mostly because you can barely get reservations there. \nTrick to get reservations there is to CALL IN. Don't try to search for reservations on opentable as it's always booked. This time, I decided not to be lazy and I called in and asked for same day reservations and I got it. :) \n\nAmbience is nice. Service is top notch. I have never had any place with great service like Zahav. They are constantly filling up your glass of water, cleaning the tables after each course and always checking up on you without being super annoying. And the food comes out really fast \nThe only negative thing I'll say is that, the music gets a little loud and I could barely have a conversation in there. \n\nThey have a bar section where you can walk in and dine, but you usually end up waiting 1-2 hours if you come during busy times. They also have few seats near the kitchen where you can watch the chefs cook (but it's blocked with glass, so it's not that great). \n\nLet's talk about FOOD. \n- I ended up loving some vegetables that I thought I would never eat. Their salads were great, but my favorite were the cabbage, beet, and string beans. The one I really didn't like was eggplant. It just had a little too mushy in texture. \n- HUMMUS!!!!! Hands down the creamiest hummus I ever had. I got the Tehina with tomatoes and peas as toppings, but I wish I got the plain Tehina because the toppings didn't make any difference to the flavor. I wish they served the hummus with the original pita bread instead of naan looking bread. It was good while it was warm, but then it started to get crunchy and hard. \n- Mezze: Fried cauliflower was ok but their Pastilla was absolutely delicious. It comes in a Pastry form filled with apricot and cheese. The best was their Haloumi cheese, and I loved how they paired it with some type of liquid jelly base. It was odd but best pairing ever. \n- Al Háesh: The chef recommended us to try the chicken and I am so glad I did. The flavor wasn't strong, but it was light and perfect. THE TEXTURE WAS AMAZING. I have never had chicken that just melts into your mouth like that. As a mushroom lover, I had to try their Crimini mushrooms, and they were so juicy and flavorful. \n- Dessert: If you're a coffee fan, don't miss out on trying their coffee custard. \n\nP.S - Go there with an appetite and get their Tayim ($45 meal course. It comes with hummus and salad to share for the table, 2 small plates per person, 1 grilled vegetable/meat per person, and dessert per person.",

  "text": "I love Ikea. For the furniture, and the food.\n\nI've furnished my whole house with Ikea stuff. The trick is to NOT buy the cheap stuff because you get what you pay for. The cheap stuff will eventually come unhinged or become uneven. Drawers will become slanted, kitchen chairs will start to fall apart. But the more expensive stuff really does hold up. I guess because they make it out of *real* wood. I also got a sectional from Ikea because I like the idea of being able to change the slip cover if I want to change my decor. It's also nice because my cat's a spiteful vomiter, so I'll need to take the slip cover to get cleaned at some point.\n\nAnyway, as for the Ikea food...you can't go wrong. I've had the .50 cent hot dogs. They're A-OK. I've had the meatballs, chicken fingers, french fries, and macaroni and cheese. It's all GOOD! And cheap. Seriously, sometimes I go here just to eat. There's no shame in it!!\n\nIf you're going to come here, be prepared to spend more than you planned. There are so many cool things you can't leave without picking up something you don't really need. Also, plan to spend a whole day. Or half day, maybe. Leave time to see everything.",

The meat is from Porter Road, so you can feel all righteous about eating locally right down to the patty. \n\nThe sheer deliciousness of this place has been written about over and over by us Yelpers, so the only thing I can tell you is: Everyone's right. We're not always right (I've eaten in some pretty terrible places, thanks to mistaken Yelpers) but we've hit the nail on the head with Riverside Grillshack. \n\nYou'll love it. I love it.

We wanted to grab a nice breakfast before the drive back home. \n\nHonestly, Fiona C has perfectly worded EVERYTHING I would want to say about this place. Everything on the menu looked amazing and it took forever for me to decide what to get. The food was prepared beautifully and the servings were enormous, I should have shared! My favorite part though was probably my salted caramel latte. Unlike snobby coffee shops that charge for syrup/soy, this place includes it! Super nice for those who are lactose intolerant because hey, having to pay extra to avoid being gassy sucks!\n\nMy reasons for not giving 5 stars are more of personal preference, I'm just not a huge American breakfast lover! Definitely a great brunch spot though!",

I have been wanting to go to Ella's for months - it is a bit off the beaten path of my normal restaurant choices, so I never think about it. My friend recommended that we go there, and I'm so glad she did! We shared a southern spring salad, and split a Eggs & Bacon pizza. The pizza was absolutely delicious! I loved every bite. The salad was a bit on the sweet side though. I think next time, I will go with a different dressing that is a bit more savory to balance out the sweet ingredients. I had a sangria as my drink, and I will say it was not that great - a bit too sweet for my liking. Next time, I'll just go with a glass of wine. Overall, an awesome experience!

I was also very intrigued by the association and history between Peruvian and Cantonese cuisines so I wanted to try. I had the spring roll and tried my friends' pho and house green salad. All were good but left me wondering where the Peruvian influence would present itself in each of the dishes. I mean, compared to the dinner menu, the lunch menu is more heavily Asian inspired than it is Latin American, so I hope that maybe soon the lunch menu can be updated to reflect that. \n\nService was great and the food and cocktails are too. However, the drinks were a a bit high ($9 for a well gin & tonic?) and the portion sizes are small. I was disappointed in leaving Chifa still hungry but what was also starved were my pockets so I grabbed a snack at home :-/ \n\nLike I said earlier, I'm looking forward to coming back because I still want to try the dinner menu and see if I'd like that better.",

Lots of fresh veggies, some oil and vinegar on it and a big chunk of feta cheese with it.  The gyros were really good as well.  Both went together perfect and the sauce for the gyro was fresh and homemade, loved it.

  "text": "The Lodge at Grant's Trail was truly an awesome experience. A friend and I were looking for a cool place to stay for our trip to St. Louis. She just happened to find this awesome place while we were looking for hotels in the downtown area. The great thing was that it's about the same price or cheaper as the hotels and was a much cooler experience. We were very skeptical at first about staying in a B&B as neither of us had been to one. We were coming from 8hrs away and knew we would get there without any staff being there so that concerned us. We decided to call and get information before booking reservations. The man we spoke to on the phone was incredibly friendly and reassured us that everything would be fine and our keys would be securely waiting for us when we arrived. We loved the idea of the themed rooms and really wanted the Alaska room, but someone had booked it right in the middle of our 3 day stay for one night so we decided to do 2 nights in the Christmas room and 1 night in the Alaska room. Prior to arriving on the day of, we were contacted by the staff to go through all the check-in procedures, determine what time we wanted breakfast, and to verify we were happy with our rooms selections. We confirmed and they sent over an email with the code to the front door and how to pick up our keys. We were all set and super excited to arrive. We got there just before 8pm and our code got us in the door and then our keys were available for us. We went straight to our room and everything was exactly how we expected it. We had a note waiting for us on the bed describing some of the amenities such as drinks downstairs, ice in the kitchen, WiFi, etc. We were very pleasantly surprised by how cozy and awesome the Christmas room is. We were warned it might be too Christmasy, but we didn't feel that way at all. It was very nice with TV, a nice bed, a Christmas town that lit up above the fireplace and an AC that worked very well. The bathroom was HUGE which was nice also. The next morning we woke up and went down to breakfast. Clark was who took care of us over the duration of our stay and he was AMAZING! He brought us an awesome warm breakfast of waffles, bacon, and sausage with fresh squeezed OJ. There was also toast, bagels, pastries, muffins, and cereal available each day. As well as coffee, water, and teas. The next morning we had a quiche that was absolutely incredible! Then, the final morning we had breakfast strata. We were pleasantly surprised with all of our breakfast items. Clark provides great service and truly makes sure you have everything you need. We only shared a table once at breakfast and it was with 2 very friendly people. The atmosphere here is truly wonderful. There's a nice area downstairs with the kitchen to sit, there's a game room area which we took advantage of, then there's a big outdoor space with picnic tables and some trails with a green grassy area. We saw dear and a beaver once we made it to the Alaska room since it has a balcony. We enjoyed this room, but the Christmas room was still our favorite. Clark let us walk around and see all the other rooms that weren't occupied while we were there and we believe that Christmas is the best. The bed in the Christmas room was a lot more comfortable than the Alaska room although the Alaska bed is bigger, it squeaks A LOT. The details in the Alaska room were very unique which made it cool, but it had some decorations we weren't a fan of. The Christmas room felt like you were sleeping in a room in someone's house with a big homey feel. The Alaska room made you feel like you were somewhere strange and a lot more noise was heard from this room than the other. The bathroom in the Alaska room was small, but it wasn't a problem for us. One thing we noticed was how clean everything at the lodge was. I'm not sure I've ever seen showers and bathrooms as clean as they were, they were immaculate! Clark does a wonderful job and made our stay that much better! We loved talking to him and learning more about the history of the lodge. We were there during the week so luckily there weren't any events going on, but we did see a few people coming in to plan their events and do walk throughs of the property. If you are looking for a unique place to stay less than 15mins from downtown this is it! We were able to go to the zoo, brewery, cardinals game, the arch, and all the famous food places with no trouble from here. I highly recommend giving them a try!",

  "text": "I love a good greasy american chinese food experience as much as the next person, so I know there's a difference between \"bad\" chinese food and bad chinese food. This was the latter. \n\nI got the broccoli in garlic sauce and an order of hot and sour soup. The garlic sauce was a surprising mix of cloyingly sweet and runny, and somehow the hot and sour soup tasted both vinegary and stale. The veggies were very sad - the advertised carrots, bamboo shoots, and wood ears turned out to be some unidetifiable melange of soggy vegetable shreds. \n\nThey do delivery, which is why I chose them in the first place, and the second star is for fast and friendly delivery service. The food, though, deserves a hard pass. Next time I'll suck it up and do takeout.",

  "text": "Located just steps from the Society Hill Towers, Zahav is a fantastic Israel-Mediterranean restaurant that sets the bar for fine dining in Philadelphia.  Not only did all my friends who ate there love it, but it lived up to all of my expectations.  A recent pick for a date night with the BF, the atmosphere was warm and inviting, with great views of the surrounding neighborhood.\n\nThe menu is a little overwhelming at first as it's served \"tapas style\" with many little plates, but I highly recommend ordering the Tayim tasting menu, which allows you to try their amazing selection of salads (salatim), hummus, and house-baked laffa bread, along with two mezze, one grilled meat plate, and dessert (so if you're dining with a partner, you get to try a large chunk of the menu).  The hummus and salads tasted so fresh and perfect, a great way to start off the meal.  For the mezze, we tried the fried cauliflower, kibbe naya (their take on a lamb tartare), crispy halloumi cheese (my favorite dish of the night), and the stuffed grape leaves.  I'm not one for stuffed grape leaves personally, but the way they created it with the ground veal and raisins made it taste that much better and more elegant than standard Greek fare.  Our main plates, the duck kebabs and beef cheeks, were also cooked to perfection.  And dessert, which we barely had room for, was also incredible: sweet enough to signify the end of the meal, but not too sweet.  I really enjoyed the warm valrhona chocolate inside the crisp Kataifi, as well as the homemade Turkish Delight in the Roasted Apricot dessert.\n\nThe service was impeccable and was able to not only make good recommendations, but provide an easy way to read and decipher the menu. Zahav also has an expansive and terrific cocktail list, and the two of us ended up splitting a pitcher of their signature cocktail, the Lemonnana (essentially, lemonade blended with herbs and bourbon).  Overall, I greatly enjoyed my experience here and it truly deserves to be among one of the best restaurants in the city.  Definitely worth it for a special occasion or for elevated Middle Eastern cuisine.",

Parking is expensive and we didn't want to valet everyday for an additional $40/not so we opted to self-park for $27/nt.  Okay now to return to how massive this place is, it has atriums, upon atriums, with hidden atriums, pools, etc.  In the words of Al Green, \"Simply beautiful!\" Very romantic-esque for our anniversary celebration.  There was a small mix up with the room due to them being completely sold out so we had to get a double based on availability at check in, but the next day we were able to get the king as promised.  Although not happy about it, it wasn't enough to ruin the experience.  The tower rooms are so nice. I love that each individual room has it's own character.  I read so many reviews mentioning lack of service and water pressure - neither of these were our experience. The light and fire show were amazing.  Take home message: If you're into history and you like to find ways to sneak exercise in without knowing it, while having a modernized room, this is the place to be!",

  "text": "Hello Martini!\n\nWednesday was my Birthday and it had to start off with a cocktail or two or three.  The hubby and I use to frequent this place a lot when we were dating, it's a great low key place with awesome martini's.  The names of some of the martini's are enough to break the ice especially on a first date =)  \n\nWe had a dinner reservation was for later in the evening so we took full advantage of their half priced happy hour app's from 4-7pm.  The hummus platter was $4 and was a nice sized portion, not too big and not too small...just enough to tied us over till dinner.\n\nThe martinis here are exceptional!  Their happy hour specials have changed a bit since we were last in and the Wednesday special was faculty night, 20% off for teachers, professors, etc, so no happy hour drinks specials for me.  But that didn't stop me from ordering more than one.  \n\nI started with the Peachy Keen, think chocolate covered peaches and cranberries.  A mix of Cranberri Vodka, peach Schnapps and White Creme de Cacao served in a chocolate rimmed glass.  So sweet and smooth!  My second martini was their Dixie Normous.  Try ordering that without blushing!  A creamy chocolate and banana liquor treat.  It is seriously one I could slam like a milkshake.  My final martini was their Coffee and Doughnuts.  A caramel-y coffee cocktail rimmed with caramel sauce.  Another sweet treat.  I almost had to be carried out to dinner.  \n\nI love this place.  I have never order a martini I didn't like, but I love martini's a lot...so I think that makes me bias, especially when under the influence of one or two or three.",

All the new Chinese restaurants are doing this instead of looking like a pagoda exploded. I like it!Love the Soup dumpling & steamer wall mural on the west wall. You order at the counter and then go choose a seat to wait for your food. I ordered the pork soup dumplings and the Shrimp & Cheese dumplings. Yes this is too much food for one person. I like to eat and try everything! I did not finish it all. These each come with a cup of soup. I believe the only Xiaolongbao I've had in St. Louis has been at Mandarin House during weekend dim sum. This was so much better! \n\nThe Good:\nThe skin was tender, smooth, and almost translucent. The \"soup\" at the top was perfectly hot and liquid and the pork filling was nice and tender. The shrimp was delicious but the pork was better! Lots of flavor!\n\nThe Bad:\nLots of opening day confusion. Food not coming out of the kitchen fast enough or at all. I waited 1 hour and 30 minutes for my dumplings. That's about 1 hour and 15 minutes too long in my opinion. Some tables got up and left long before their food would have been ready. Some people who had just gotten there ended up getting served food made for people who left and getting out very quickly. EVERYONE who walked in after me got served before me to the tune of 15+ people. At some point the entire restaurant started complaining that someone other than me was getting served. \n\nIt was delicious and I will go back but I'll wait (quite a while) until after they have a little time to work out the kinks!\n\nMy review should obviously be less than 4 stars but the food was good, I want local businesses to succeed and I'm here because I love food and the local restaurant scene. I'm not here to trash a brand new local business.",

  "text": "A new restaurant on the scene from Starr Restaurants, The Love is in the heart of Rittenhouse Square and provides a nice ambiance and dining atmosphere. There is a bar adjacent to the host area with limited seating and the general dining area is inviting but not pretentious. The restaurant isn't overly spacious and though our table was a bit small it was nicely located near a window. \n\nThe service was attentive and the pace was good. \nThe menu features a variety of appetizers, pasta, entrees, and vegetable sides, many of which seem to be comfort food or southern inspired dishes. \n\nWe enjoyed the Parker House Rolls, served in a cast iron skillet and accompanied with chive butter. They were tasty and a nice starter.\n\nThe caramelle pasta was probably the least inspired. Although it was nicely presented the portion was minimal and though the butter sauce was warm, the pasta twists themselves were cold which was somewhat off putting. \n\nThe highlight of the meal was actually the seasonal chicken. I'm not a huge fan of chicken but this chicken was fried in buttermilk, boneless, and was soft and flavorful. The accompanying grits were a bit heavy on the butter, but okay. The collard greens were fine, the comeback sauce was well prepared. \n\nFor a side vegetable we tried the torched broccoli with hot sauce. The presentation was a little unsightly, it was more like broccoli tossed haphazardly in sauce, but it was tasty. \n\nOur drinks were good, the restaurant has a good enough variety of cocktails, wine and other libations to get along with, though I wouldn't characterize the pours as particularly generous for some of the prices. \n\nOur dessert consisted of the Dirt Sundae, of chocolate mousse and topped with crushed cookies/fruit. The presentation was nice and the mousse was well flavored and a good way to conclude the meal. \n\nAll in all, I think the ambiance and service were where the restaurant excelled. We enjoyed most of the fare, with the exceptions noted above. I would be curious to try some additional entrée dishes or return for brunch.",

For an app we got the calamari but it was legit like eating little tiny raw octopuses because they didn't fry it so it was chewy and rubbery in my opinion. I wasn't such a fan. But I get the concept they're going for with the unique take on normal calamari & I can appreciate that. On the flip side the sauce it came in made up for it and was awesome. \n\nThe service was pretty good and as usual I always love the ambiance that this place has to offer. Very cool new Mexican vibe within the decor selections. We came on a Saturday night (they were busy) and were pleased to be seated immediately! \n\nPrice range is a little higher but with an upper scale mexican restaurant, I'd say that's to be expected. They do have some reasonably priced dishes though. I had the margarita and my date had the sangria both of which were very tasty in my opinion. I think I liked the marg a little better but then again I'm 100% a margarita girl. The cocktails range from around $8-$11ish they're good tho and i was pleasantly surprised with the size of my margarita. \n\nWith that being said, All in all a very good experience!",

We couldn't decide on if we wanted regular potatoes or sweet potatoes, so we just got both and shared. I personally liked the regular potatoes more, but it's just because I cannot eat a large amount of sweet potatoes at once. However, if you love sweet potatoes, get it with sweet potatoes! It's so unique to see it as a hash option at breakfast places. The sweetness of the sweet potato with all the yummy savory veggies, runny egg yolk, and sauce is so DELICIOUS! Out of both sauces, the hollandaise was tasty, but I enjoyed the tang of the salsa more! \n\nWe also got the Madagascar vanilla bean latte & the dark chocolate latte. Both were superb! Also, please don't forget to put jam on your toast, it is so good!! \n\nAs for customer service, it was also amazing! They continuously checked up on us when needed and were super chatty/ helpful! We came on a Monday afternoon and it was packed, so I would be ready for the weekend if you choose to come. \n\nI will definitely be coming back to get another make your own hash & try to the french toast! \n\nFun fact: they make their bread, chocolate sauce, and jam in house! \n\nRecommendation: \n- Madagascar vanilla bean latte\n- Make your own hash: sweet potatoes, salsa, over easy egg, mushroom, spinach, pepper jack cheese and corn",

  "text": "This location has been open since 2014. It is located just a few businesses down from Publix. It is open 10 AM to 9 PM Mon thru Fri; Sat 9 AM to 9 PM; & 10 AM to 8 PM on Sundays. This is a chain store that buys and sells gently used clothing for teens, misses, women, men, & plus sized individuals, as well as footwear; handbags; & accessories. Its webpage advertises Plato's Closet as a business whose clients are in their \"teens and twenties;\" however, many of the clothing styles represented today could be worn by women & men of any age. \n\nShoppers can save up to 70% off retail prices. Overall, prices were lower than I expected, but I did find some items of clothing that were definitely overpriced considering they were pre-owned. This is a BAGLESS store, so come prepared! Customers have 7 days to return any items, but the tags must still be intact & accompany the original store receipt. \n\nShould you wish to earn extra money by selling your gently worn clothing, etc, BUYING HOURS are 10 AM to 8 PM Mon thru Fri; Sat 9 AM to 8 PM; & Sun 10 AM to 7 PM. Plato's Closet buys & sells Women's tops in size XS to 6x & bottoms size 00 to 30. For men, staff will buy size XS to 4x in tops & size 28 to 40 in bottoms. On each rack, there are LIMITED options available for those who are Plus size. Currently, if you wish to sell your \"trendy\" clothing, it should be Spring & Summer fabric/style. (I brought in a large bag that contained New w/ Tag winter clothing; I was sent packing. Lol.) At this time, MEN'S CLOTHING & ALL SHOES (especially shoes) are in HIGH DEMAND. Plato's does NOT buy underwear and/or PJs.\n\nWish to save even more? Once you sign up for the Rewards Program, you'll \"forever have access to exclusive discounts, promotions, & events. More points. More fun.\" Sign up online or sign up by texting PLATOSWC to 578-277.\n\nThis is a decent-sized store. It is clean, well-organized & brightly lit-- SEE PICS. The aisles are comfortably large, but too many racks were packed so tight that it was somewhat difficult to examine clothing without struggling to pull the hanger from the rack. (I had to retrieve at least 3 tops from the floor.) There are approximately 7 dressing rooms. Just outside each are metal folding chairs, a clothing return rack, & a bin for shoe returns-- SEE PICS.\n\nDuring today's visit, one young staff member was very friendly & wore a huge smile. The shift leader, though, never smiled & lacked a warm & fuzzy personality that often helps attract return visits. According to Plato's website, the company is hiring for full-time & part-time positions. Upload your resume online.\n\nBefore I drove off to donate my big bag of clothing to Salvation Army, I left the store w/ 3 never worn items of clothing priced $3 to $10 that this 50-yr-old (non-teen & non-twenty-something) plans to Rock! Lol. I LOVE fashion & I love deals, so it only makes sense for me to return once the fall/winter line hits the racks.",

  "text": "Gorgeous and delicious are understatements. La Colombe's first location to serve actual food (not just pastries and biscotti) gives me hope that they will open up other locations in other cities. (*hint hint* San Francisco please!) Speaking with one of the food runners, this is apparently La Colombe's new flagship and headquarters (since they're based in Philly). Hence why this is a behemoth of a location (and I say that in a good way). As soon as you walk in, you'll notice incredibly high ceilings, cute vintage lighting, and a bounty of pastries, bread (you can order half or full orders of bread), and display sandwiches. They also freshly prepare salads, tartines, boards, and skillets (which looked amazing, but seemed a bit too heavy for a weekday meal). Basically, this is more like a restaurant -- you order food up front, they give you a number, and they bring it to you.\n\nOf course, their star attraction is the coffee. La Colombe's single origins and blends are mighty tasty. I ordered an early grey tea to be iced and that was incredibly smooth yet still herbaceous and heady. It was naturally sweet in some ways... so delicious on its own I didn't even add sugar (which I usually do!). \n\nNow, I took the subway from Center City so I could EAT. And eat, I did! I ordered the porchetta sandwich. And, my gawd, I wanted to delay my flight back home so I could return here for dinner. Sigh. Oh well. It was delicious while it lasted. Piled onto a fresh piece of baguette was the meat covered in roasted peppers (so Philly!) and sharp provolone. That was probably the wisest $10 I've spent on the entire trip. I especially loved every bite where I could taste the fat from the meat and the natural roasting oils absorbed in the bread. It was so heavenly. \n\nAs mentioned, this location is their flagship so you can imagine this store to be incredibly handsome in regards to its interior. It is \"industrial chic\" (if you wanna call it that): modern, sleek, simple, and romantically urban. There is plenty of seating. I will say, however, that like all (I believe) La Colombe locations, there is no wifi and limited electrical outlets. They probably think it's distasteful to stay in a store all day working on something and not clearing up room for patrons (which I get to a certain extent). That said, come here to read a book/magazine or catch up with a friend. Don't plan to study for your final or finish up that complicated report for work. I suspect the no wifi and limited electrical outlets is intentional so one can engage with the world and not just zone out on the computer.\n\nI used to be somewhat wary of La Colombe because their stores often felt uncomfortable and uninviting (I'm thinking especially of the locations in Chicago), but this Philly location changes my opinion. La Colombe: if you continue to build stores like this (with attention to comfort AND with the ability to serve quality food [not just coffee]), you'll probably have even more loyal followers.",

  "text": "Definitely a nice Texas meat place. \n\nFirst off, the service here was amazing. Everyone was very friendly, knowledgeable and cheerful. The rolls they bake fresh are very delicious (although I didn't particularly care for the cinnamon flavored butter). They also have roasted peanuts at every table (and also two very large barrel-fulls of the roasted peanuts at the entrance/waiting area). My parents really loved the peanuts and couldn't stop eating them.\n\nThe price was really quite reasonable since most of the dishes come with two sides. We ordered a full rack of ribs and side orders of mashed potatoes and steak fries.  The ribs were literally falling-off-the-bone  delicious. The flavor and texture of the meat and BBQ sauce was among the best I've had in a while. The quantity of the mashed potatoes was a bit disappointing since the size was the equivalent of a large spoonful in a small dish. Also, the steak fries were only average, although they were well seasoned. It would have been much better if it little was a little more crispy on the outside. \n\nWe also ordered the grilled salmon with a side of Caesar salad and a sweet potato. The salad was very fresh and well flavored. The croutons were super yummy, although it didn't feel like they gave us enough (either that or they were just that good). The sweet potato was also very well steamed and flavorful. The only complaint is that the salmon smelled... well... fishy (not in a good way). The taste was also a little off... and definitely did not mix well with the ribs. We ended up eating only a few bits of the salmon, and thought we'd let the manager know about the potential problem with the freshness of the fish.\n\nWe asked the server if we could speak to the manager (and she immediately went to get him for us). We explained the problem and the manager immediately offered to get us another dish or to take the grilled salmon off our bill. I was very impressed with the professionalism of his manner and actions and would definitely go back (although I would probably still avoid ordering the salmon).\n\nI strongly recommend going to this place for the ribs (and the freshly cut steaks seemed yummy too!).",

  "text": "I got to say Crescent city is amazing!  The food here is delicious and homemade!  The Mac n cheese is excellent!  A huge bowl of creamy Mac n cheese for $9...you can eat it as a meal or share it with the table as a side.  Definitely one of the best Mac n cheese I have had,, rich and creamy loaded with plenty of cheese!\n\nI also loved the jambalaya, my friend and I agreed that it was the best jambalaya in town!  The jambalaya has plenty of sausage and meat, beans, spices, and tons of flavors!  A plate of jambalaya is like $9, cheap and satisfying!  I ordered the mixed grill plate, which is a combination of daily house made sausages.   My favorite was the beef sausage; served with a sweet bbq sauce...it was sooo good!  Just think of little smokies, except these are a tad bigger and homemade, so good served with their bbq sauce!  The other sausages were good, but I felt they were too lean.  The lamb sausage wasn't bad, slightly sweet, served with a mustard based sauce.  You can only eat so much sausage, and for $15, it could feed two people.  A slice of house cured pastrami was served on my mixed grill plate; I didn't like the pastrami, it was too salty for my liking.  The house pickles were excellent!  All in all, the house made sausage was a winner, and they feature different sausages every day! \n\nI would definitely come back here, the food was all excellent and the prices are cheap!  The service here is also excellent.  I would recommend this restaurant for anyone would wants good jambalaya or sausage...I have not had their other entrees, but I heard the pizza is excellent!",

You're in luck though if you go at an odd time such as a weekday afternoon or any evening.\n\nThe food is spectacular, with probably the most creative breakfast options I've ever seen. There's no shortage of huevos rancheros and other Mexican-inspired dishes, heck there's pretty much an amalgamation of some of the dishes you could think of- standard American, Southern, Jewish. The menu is just miles long with breakfast, lunch and dinner options for everyone. And as busy as the place is- the service is pretty on-point.\n\nAs a spicy food lover I must also indicate that there's not one but THREE different bottles of hot sauce on every table: Frank's, Tabasco & Sriracha.\n\nBest part: breakfast served all day.\nWorst part: their wait is notorious as I'd mentioned and the place is CASH ONLY\n\nHonestly, I need to go here more often to try again and again. It's worth the wait.",

We had a great time, and the environment is posh and fun. But the server was asleep at the wheel - as in, he forgot to bring our entrees and just handed us the check. When we asked for our food, he stared at us blankly. The manager was apologetic, but I do think they could generally do better at polishing service. That said: standout dishes were beef tartare, shrimp entree and mushroom sides. Wine list was lovely, but server was clueless about it.",

  "text": "I had plans with my nearly 90 year old grandmother to go to a matinee of The Wizard of Oz at Touhill on a Sunday and I was looking for somewhere nice to go to lunch prior. I chose Hendel's Restarant. We arrived at about 12:15pm on Sunday and they said the wait would be about 10-15 minutes. Roughly 15 minutes later they sat us at a table for 2 on the patio under a heater which was fine. We had to flag a server down who walked by us 3 times and ask if she was our server. She said she didn't know but she'd be happy to take care of us. We explained we were in a hurry and ordered drinks and lunch right then. I ordered the gyro sandwich with French fries and my grandmother ordered the Portobello mushroom sandwich with French fries. The food arrived promptly which gave us about 20 minutes to eat. She loved her Portobello mushroom sandwich and we both loved the French fries which turned out to be large potato wedges with an orange seasoning on them. My gyro sandwich was sad. I was expecting pre-made strips and knew that somewhere like this they weren't carving the meat off a spit or anything but when I took the pita off the taco stand it came on and looked inside there were only 3 or 4 strips of the gyro meat. I was hungry all afternoon! The place is cute and there is some clever presentation like serving the gyro on a taco stand and serving the French fries in a mini metal fry basket but in my opinion the food I ate did not match the atmosphere. They didn't actually make anything on my plate. Anyone could assemble this from any restaurant supply company. Also when we were seated on the patio there were 6 empty tables for 2. They were staggering seating people when they had plenty of empty tables. I wasn't wowed here. Star #3 is for the nice server.\n\n*In case you were worried we made it to our seats at The Wizard of Oz with 4 minutes to spare and it was lovely!",

  "text": "I was in charge of looking for a lunch place for a group and this one sounds pretty good, as it has a variety of food from pizza to burger to veggie bowl.  Not to mention their beer.  \n\nMany places boast about their beer selection, but Oak & Stone is altogether another level.  They have like over 50 taps, all line up along the wall. You get a wristband, after having your ID checked, and then you can go to the taps and pour yourself whatever you want to try.  Each tap has a screen with the basic info and you can tap on the screen for a more detailed story.  The beers are mostly from Florida, up and down the state, with some limited releases, grouped by style.  They even have 4 or 5 ciders!  You are charged by how much you pour, down to 1/10 of an ounce, so you won't feel lose out if you happen to pour 4.1 oz. All of us love this system and keep leaving the table for more beer.  We end up drinking (and paying more) than if we were to just order a glass, but we all felt that the price is very reasonable for the amount we drink, and the ability to try just two or three oz of something without bothering anybody is priceless. \n\nOkay, on to the food... even though I admit I'll be back just for the beer... \n\nThe pizza has a lot of interesting toppings.  We get the fun guy (wordplay on fungi) which is so delicious, and the Far East, with Korean meatball, sesame slaw and even some molecular gastronomic soy sauce pearls. The latter is too sweet for my taste. The turkey burger was a little on the mushy side.  Overall, great beer, good enough food - what you'd expect from a beer-centric restaurant like this. \n\nService is phenomenal.  Needless to say, they are all ready to guide us through using the beer system and help us with the menu, but when we leave, they pour extra lemonade into little cups with straw for the kids to take along (and that's after a refill). How awesome is that!\n\nPlease please, Oak & Stone, make your way down south soon!!",

While The Eagle wasn't our first choice, we ended up here because the other location didn't open until 12pm, but glad we ended up here.  We arrive little after 11am, got seated right away and after reviewing the menu, we went with the following items:\n\n- Whole fried Chicken\n- Fried Chicken Sandwich\n- Fried Chicken BLT\n- Blackened Shrimp Po'Boy\n- Side items:  Collards, Mac-n-Cheese, Spoonbread and fries.\n\nThe bills total was around $90, this included few drinks as well and this order was for 5 people.\n\nOur Favorites:\n\n- Fried Chicken - the chicken was perfectly fried, moist and juicy!!  I would highly recommend their fried chicken. What makes this chicken even better is their spicy honey!!  Pour on top of the chicken, dip it, whatever you do, don't forget to try it!!\n\n- Fried Chicken Sandwich - very simple, yet delicious!!  Perfectly fried crispy chicken breast, with coleslaw in between two soft buns!  I could eat this everyday!  I'm not a fan of chicken breast, but the meat was tender and juicy, heck yeah, I could be converted from darkside!!!\n\n- Collards - didn't expect too much, but was blown away by the taste and flavors in their collards!  Perfectly seasoned and the greens were cooked perfectly!  Their collards are in my top 5!\n\n- Spoonbread - excellent, moist, love how they brushed the top with butter before serving and with spoon on top.  It's one side you must order with the collards!\n\nGood, but...\n\n- Blackened Shrimp Po-Boy - What I expected and what I got is the reason this dish ended up at the bottom.  The shrimp was perfectly cooked, but it was not \"blackened\" as expected... that I can let it go... but the charred avocado relish didn't help this dish.  They took a simple po'boy and tried to make it sophisticated, just keep it to the basic.\n\n- Mac-n-cheese - this dish was on salty side... most likely due to the type of cheeses they used in the dish.\n\n- Fries - had them in other locations before.\n\n- Chicken BLT - not bad, but while the BLT concept was there, wasn't blown away by the sandwich. \n\nTheir menu had more drink options then food options and their focus seems to be their fried chicken.  This is a good location if you are meeting up with friends or colleagues for drinks.  The street it was located on, reminded me of Chicago.  The service was excellent and if you are in the area would highly recommend stopping by.  Oh, on Sunday's parking is free :)",

It's generously sized and the bread is soooooo yummy. I convinced my skeptical Cuban friend to come and she had three media Noche. She said she felt like she was at home again. \nThe yellow rice is simple and flavorful and they bring you a shout of Cuban coffee near the end of your meal.

  "text": "Why 2 stars? Because nothing turns me off more than pushy salesmanship.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nLately, I've been on a quest to find a place where I can get an oil change without having someone list the 13 things I could upgrade to or different system flushes that I need. I don't know why this is so hard to find, but in Tampa, it seems to be a requirement to try to rip people off if you're in the oil change business.\n\nI was in the area anyway and saw the great reviews here, so I figured I would give them a try. As I pulled up, there was literally no one in line, and this was the kind of place where you just stay in your car while they are working on it, which was perfect!\n\nThe guy (named Andreas) seemed to be having a lot of fun doing his job, as he was laughing and dancing as he worked. He was making a lot of jokes as he was putting my info in the system, which is definitely nicer than the person who is obviously miserable in their job. But that's about where the fun ended for me.\n\nHe begins quoting me on the different price options, and of course, he starts at the highest number, which is something crazy like $79.99. As he is working his way down the ridiculously high priced services, I see the list of prices next to my window. To see the cheapest options, it requires you to sit up in your seat and look all the way down to the bottom. I saw the lowest option was $36.99 so I said, \"let me stop you right there - I want the $36.99 oil change.\"\n\nHe said, \"wellllll.... I'm going to do something special for you...\" and then he began to whisper, \"I'm going to hook you up with a 25% discount for the high-mileage oil change at $54.99. What do you think about that?\"\n\nI was quickly trying to do the math in my head for 25% off $55, and then he whispered some more, \"Just nod your head and say yes...\" as he was giving me the creepiest stare and nodding his head up and down. \n\nI said, \"look, as long as it comes out to the same or less money than the $36.99 option, I'm good with that.\" \n\nHe said, \"yeah it actually might end up being cheaper.\"\n\nSo then he goes about doing the oil change with his partner and continues being loud, cracking jokes and trying to make small talk. At this point, I'm really annoyed at how I've once again found such an oil change place that's built upon up-selling and pressuring people. \n\nIt comes to the end of the service and he tells me the total is $45.69. I say, \"woah, what happened to $36.99 or cheaper.\"\n\nHe says, \"well after you have Uncle Sam and yadda yadda, you get to the $45.69. And see - only $3 more than the original oil change, plus you get better oil!\"\n\nSo here's what bothers me:\n\n1) The pressured up-selling to begin with, have I mentioned that?\n\n2) He told me that the price would be equal or less than the base-line oil change.\n\n3) The total came out to $3 more, which he obviously knew beforehand.\n\nDoes paying $3 more for something bother me? Absolutely not. But in principle, this level of sleaziness agitated me to my core. I write a ton of positive reviews for great local businesses that I love, but in this case, I'm so glad that we have Yelp to get the word out about people and businesses like this. In the past, consumers would have to deal with this kind of stuff without a way to warn others.\n\nSo now that we have this tool, here is my official warning: I would highly recommend looking elsewhere for your oil change, but sadly, I've yet to find a place that I can really vouch for! After my wife had a similar experience at another location, I know one thing for sure - I will never visit a Take 5 again.",

Years went by before I would visit again and I mentioned to someone how all these cats used to be there- all the time. Some old lady was keeping them fed. It was kind of weird when I showed up 15 years later to see that the cat pride is still strong, maybe stronger than before...and someone practically built them a village. How has no one mentioned this in all these reviews? Hah. So there's one portion of the park where you'll see a ton of cats. \n\nOther than that, this park is pretty decent. Lots of wandering to do in the woods, which is something I always love. It's gorgeous in the winter when it snows and the water freezes over.

I'm officially obsessed with the crispy ranch \"chick'n\" sandwich - I don't know how they do it, but the protein looks, feels and tastes miraculously like chicken!  I have dissected it and all but looked at it under a microscope, and it's a total culinary revelation.  It even reheats well for next day lunch leftovers.  The fajita wrap is super flavorful, and the veggie burger, though not as inexplicably identical to its carnivorous counterpart as the crispy chick'n, is meaty and hearty.  Sweet potato fries are good - pretty standard - but what makes them unique is the dipping sauce, a whipped concoction of savory cilantro goodness.  The only downsides I can see are that they've been sold out of the kale the two times we've tried to order it, and there's no restroom for their dine-in customers.  But all in all, this is not what you think of as typical vegan food - it's substantial.  It's flavorful.  It's total man food (no offense to my male vegan friends).",

It doesn't taste bad, but it's not a standout when there are several better burger places on St Pete Beach, so I wouldn't get that as it's just mediocre.\n\nThey have dining indoors in a bar area with a number of tables and lots of TV's, a more traditional dining room sans TV's, and an outdoor area.  The outdoor tables are along a reasonably busy street (Blind Pass Rd) but they've got large planters with bushes to keep you from having to watch all the cars heading north to VIP Mexican Restaurant for margaritas.\n\nWe'd probably eat here more, but the service is not always the best from a speed perspective (attention to detail, being polite/friendly, etc. is always five stars) and the dining room is often really warm; on our most recent visit I left sweaty.  The dining room also has a really bad audio system; it sounds like your dad's old stereo that you blew out the speakers on when you were a teenager and your parents weren't home.  The only other mild complaint is the drink prices are really high.  They do have Peroni, but other than that, it's just beer and wine, and just run of the mill options like the typical Bud products, Shock Top, Dos Equis, etc.  Beers are $4.50, so we typically don't come here when we feel like having beer since that bill can get out of hand fast.",

  "text": "What a fantastic event. So many restaurants so many wines and even a few beers. Honestly, even if you aren't a wine fan you should just come to sample all of the amazing food.\n\nWe arrived right at 1 pm and the line was already pretty long.  We were in the gate by 1:15. Before you enter the event you are handed a small glass and card on a lanyard with 12 circles.  Every time you get a drink the staff will mark off a circle so to not over serve you.  12 was more than enough. \n\nSome food favorites were Anthony's Chop House which ran out of food first. (bad move on their part) I was so close to sampling one of their delicious burgers. Another favorite was Blue Sushi's ceviche. I personally enjoyed Ruth's Chris Steak House veal ravioli.\n\nI was happy to see there were also a few businesses serving desserts. This was a nice change up because some of the fishes were rich and heavy.  Gallery Pastry shop was there with their macaroons and a hazelnut chocolate pudding mousse. \n\nI was super excited to see an iced coffee vendor as it was super hot the day of. \n\nMy husband was happy to see a couple of beer vendors too. There was a delicious pumpkin ale. I would like to see a couple more next year. \n\nThe event was a huge success and I can't wait to attend another. I would recommend finding a way for more tables to sit and stand at. Maybe even adding some fans or cooling mists. The event was super hot and a lot of food tents were in the sun. \n\nPro tip.  Grab a bottle of water to drink and rinse your pallet but also to clean out your wine glass. \n\nFor staff, the water ran out early so a reminder to add more next year. Loved the backdrop for photos.  The Kroger bags were a nice touch also.",

  "text": "By golly is this the best service I have ever received in a really long time! Absolutely amazing and definitely worth the bucks to hit up Fogo de Chao in Philly! (TIP: I would sign up for their newsletters for promos - They're really helpful) \n\nBasically if I were to give a rundown on my experience this would be how it is, You walk in (Made rerversation - And I highly recommend you do too!) They get you seated (They made an effort to get the chair, probably because I was a woman, while I sat) and then they'll ask you if you've been there before, if you say yes I'm sure they skip the \"instructions\" but since this was our first time they made it very easy to understand and let us go on our merry way. Basically you get this \"chip\" it'll be Red for Stop on one side and Green for Go on the other side. You turn it to Green if you want the \"meat servers\" to stop by your table and cut you a piece of what they're carrying (Each server carries a different cut, type and or different seasoning of meats) and you take your handy dandy tongs that are provided at the table and grab a hold of the piece while they happily slice the meat for you. Afterwards, you can either keep it on Green for more meats or you turn it down to Red to stop while you enjoy the succulent pieces of meats. \n\nSo besides the \"you don't have to move\" meat buffet, there's also your choices of getting up and going to the Salad Bar, which they will have, obviously salads, pieces of cut fruit (Pinapples, papaya, and etc.), they even have 3 types of cheeses as well as bread and slices of cured meat laid out for you to pick and choose. But besides the salad bar they also have a small section of \"carbs\" which are seasoned rice, potatoes and what looked to me like marshmallows/smores?\n\nSo what else besides handy men with cuts of meat and the salad bar? They have a huge list of wines, cocktails and drinks that you can choose from in the beginning (BTW drinks are not all you can drink, nor are the desserts in the end). And besides this they bring you, in the beginning of your meal, small side dishes, which consists of small trays of \"carbs\" which I liked to avoided...except that they were delicious! I'm sure you can ask for more if you like them and you wanted more, but I didn't ask them personally. \n\nService? Pfft! It was AMAZING! They make sure to know why you're there (Anniversary, birthdays and whatnot - TIP: They actually give you a complimentary dessert with what you're celebrating) They also make sure to \n\nOverall, this place has amazing service, wonderfully seasoned cuts of meat and a great salad bar! I would whole heartedly recommend this restaurant to anyone that's looking to spend a special night with a loved one or even a huge celebration!",

  "text": "I wish I could give Black Rock Vapor TEN STARS!\nI've been a smoker for 23 years and on average I smoke about a pack and a half to two packs a day. Last year,  I almost dies from a PE and Pnuemonia in my right lung. I cut back smoking for awhile, but being a true hardcore smoker,  I went back up. I have a few friends that Vape and they recommended I switch. I was hesitant,  but I FINALLY decided to switch over from traditional cigarettes to Vaping.\nSo, I KNOW NOTHING about vaping, the equipment, the juices, etc. I had a friend give me some basic info, but after looking on Yelp and seeing the great reviews for Black Rock Vapor, and it only being 2 minutes from my house, I decided to go. I walked in having no idea what I wanted to get.\nGreg, the owner, greeted me when I walked in and I told him my situation and what I was looking for. I'm a total Noob to vaping, I wanted something adjustable, not too big, I didn't want a mod that was really powerful either. Great was beyond AWESOME! He really helped me pick out a Mod and Tank that suited my needs. Then the fun part, the juices!\nI LOVE THE TASTING BAR! It's really nice being able to taste test the flavors before you buy them and they have a list of about 20 flavors,  30ml each, that are only $10, instead of $16.95, each month the flavors change out. I got Black Cherry, Rootbeer Candy, and Mocha. \nAlso, and I was prepared to pay $500 to get my card just for this,  THEY HAVE CBD!! I've been wanting to try CBD to see if it will help with my back pain. I got the 150mg, and I think I'm gonna try the 500mg. Greg said he has a few clients with similar back problems to mine that it's really helped. I'm so excited about this!\nGreg really made sure I got everything I needed that would fit my wants and needs. He didn't try to sell me anything more than I needed. He and the girl there, I forgot her name but her winged liner is on point, we're both very nice, helpful, and they really know their stuff! \nI will be going back on Sunday or Monday as I would like a bigger, top fill tank for the nicotine juice and I will keep the smaller tank for the CBD. I don't plan on ever going anywhere else for my vaping needs! \nAnd I'm down from 2 packs a day to only half a pack in less than a week!! I hope to only be vaping within 3 months, 6 at most! Stop in if you're an experienced Vaper or if you're looking to switch over. Very happy with my ELEAF iStick Power, 80W and 5000 maahs. See, I'm already learning!\nI can't say enough about how great this shop and the people here are!! \nSupport Local and HAPPY Yelping!!",

These raw oysters were definitely better than Acme. \n\nAnyway, the pate was one of best pates I've ever had. I prefer to eat it with the table bread rather than the crispy bread given with it. The fried oysters were sooo mouth watering. It was perfectly crispy and evenly battered. The quail was delicious as well! The bread pudding was okay imo.

I thought the parking lot looked crowded when I arrived, and once inside I could see why.  Every mom and daughter in St Albert must have been inside, trying on costumes and shoes, leotards and tutus, sparkles and tulles abounding.  I was approached immediately by a roving employee (they were all dressed in black, so easy to spot) who took my list and filled it in record time with exactly what I needed, and emphasized that if any size wasn't perfect they would be happy to exchange it for my daughter when she was available.  At checkout, they asked if my granddaughter had her heart set on anything in particular for Halloween, as they were making lists for special ordering hard-to-get costumes, such as Elsa (and if you don't know who that is, you obviously do not have a young girl in your family!).\n\nIt's pretty amazing to walk into a store you don't know, finding it crowded with so many enthusiastic customers, get helped immediately with lots of smiles, and be checked out and back in your car in six minutes.  I am impressed.  I am also eager to return on a quieter day to explore all the goodies I spotted, and go upstairs to the costume area.  The employees get big kudos from me for being knowledgable, friendly, and efficient.  \n\np.s. I also loved the sign in their window that said, \"Thank you for shopping local.\"",

  "text": "I REALLY wanted to LOVE this place.   I go to Finis Landing quite a bit, and I was so looking forward to visiting the spin off.  I stopped in to have a beer and grab some food and catch the vibe. It was about 430pm on Monday, and there was a big table behind me,  and a few people at the bar.   \nI was hoping for a couple Mexican beers on draft, as I saw them in prior reviews.    They only had Dos Equis Amber on draft.    I had one and switched to Pacifico bottle.....( happy hour bottles were 5 dollars).\nI noticed several kitchen staff sitting outside of the kitchen chatting with the bar tender.   There was a  friendly cook/manager?? who  walked around talking to the large table behind me, as well as the table on the perimeter.  I heard him introduce himself, and say he checks up on people to make sure they have a good experience.     He brought the perimeter table  several dishes....and I could not find them on the menu.   Still undeterred, I really wanted to try several things on the menu.    I love burgers, and I was intrigued by the \"burger of the week\".  \n\n I asked and the kind bartender what the burger was....she grabbed a small notepad  where the description was ...and told me...\" it has green chiles on it and it sounds delicious\".    I love green chiles....so I said I am in.    I asked for it to be medium rare.....and that part was excellent.  \n \nIt said \"market price\"....but I am figuring hey.... Its a hamburger.. how expensive can it be? \n\nIt was $18.00!!....for a burger and fries. \n\n When I opened the to go container....it looked...(well.. see picture).   It was salty, and the bun was super hard.     I was so sad.....I mean seriously sad. \n\nThe avocado tacos were good...but literally they used a quarter of an avocado per taco, put some stuff on it and ...boom.   I ordered corn tortillas, the tacos came out on flour tortillas.    Two tacos and beans...$12.00.  \n\nSO here is my take.   I understand they are new, and training staff, etc.   However clear prices and better descriptions of each item would be most excellent.    Also, if you are walking around greeting customers and asking how things are going, don't over look the single people who sit at the bar and tables.  EVERY CUSTOMER matters.   \n The prices are high based on Tucson, and if you are asking $18.00 for \"the burger of the week\"....a better description of what you are getting other  than a note pad is warranted, and it should be presented looking better than what I got. \n\nI may try this place again, but no time soon.",

It is designed as a dining experience where the food comes fist. I found my focus was less on the date and more on experiencing all-Canadian ingredients served at room temperature. Fascinating to be sure. \n\nWe started with appetizers of Malt hazelnuts and Olive Plums. The hazelnuts tasted like postum and we're quite addictive. The olive plums were excellent at the start but grew tiresome. By the end of the meal I had finished them but my wife had long given up eating them. \n\nThe lamb tartar was sweet, the texture was so soft. I loved it but I noticed a nearby dinner did not finish hers. When the server asked if she wanted it packaged to go she simply said, \"No.\" My wife had the salmon and was very happy with her choice. The dill sauce worked so well with the subtle flavours of the salmon. \n\nFor dessert we shared the rice pudding which had an amazing taste initially but the undercooked graininess of the rice was more and more noticeable as you continued. Happy we had it though we were more impressed with the story behind it than the taste of it. (Did you know that rice is grown in only one place in Canada by a man who uses it for sake production? The pudding here uses the rice and the residue from the sake fermentation process. I guess you can grow almost anything in the Okanagan!) \n\nThe atmosphere felt very deliberate, very calculated, much like the menu. I wouldn't call it comfortable but it was welcoming enough that I would return again. Staff are very friendly and proud of their work. When your server is your chef it certainly changes the experience. \n\nI you want an even more adventurous experience, check out the Alder Room next door.",

One of my friends, the self-proclaimed  \"indoorsy\" Bill C., was not thrilled that our afternoon had been devoted to hiking Sabino Canyon (which was beautiful, by the way). Four of us finished the hike about 30-40 minutes ahead the remaining 3, who had lingered to swim in the falls. Frost Gelato  made for the perfect stop as we waited for our friends to finish. \n\nI recommend the affogato. Authentic affogatos (affogati?) are composed of an espresso shot poured over a tiny little scoop of vanilla gelato. I love real Italian affogatos, but I much prefer the more substantial American version served by Frost. For about the same price as a medium, you can get TWO flavors of gelato and chocolate sauce covered in a generous serving of espresso and topped with whipped cream. (Confession:  the affogato is so good that just writing about it gave me such an uncontrollable chocolate craving that I had to go into my cupboards to get a few dark chocolate covered almonds from Sprouts in order to complete this review). \n\nAnd thus the day was saved. Bill's annoyance with nature disappeared, and gelato triumphed again.",

  "text": "I made my first trip to Taste on Sunday for brunch. I have lived in the neighborhood for almost 8 months and had never stopped. I will make Taste a part of my routine from now on. I really love the concept of ordering, getting your coffee/water, and enjoying conversation, while waiting for your food to be delivered. The general coffee selections were very nice and I enjoyed the 'pour your own' concept for the water and coffee. The water options had nice infused fruit water, which was very refreshing! I ordered the breakfast sandwich on a bagel, with a side of fruit. I could not believe my eyes when it came to the table, the eggs were perfectly cooked and plentiful. If I would have to guess, I would say that there were 3-4 eggs on the bagel! The bacon was nicely cooked and crispy, with a very light aioli to pair well with the eggs and bacon flavors. I love the outdoor seating option and ambiance of the restaurant. I will definitely be back for brunch (and maybe dinner). I would highly suggest Taste to anyone looking for a great brunch experience!",

If you're a heat chaser, then neither will be very hot for you. It's more of a peppery hot than a full on mouth and tongue burning. It's very tasteful and you can still enjoy the taste of the chicken. \n\nThe dirty bird fries are amazing. The crinkle cut fries are topped with cheese, macaroni, pickles, bite sized pieces of chicken. I loved every bite, this for me really stole the show. I would order the dirty bird fries every time I returned. \n\nHattie B's definitely lives up to the hype, give it a try. The 30 minute wait is very worth it.",

The wait was totally worth it. We started with a pitcher of the best orange juice I've ever had and some very strong coffee. We then dived into some stuffed challah French toast and huevos rancheros, the two most popular dishes on the menu. The portions were huge-- you could easily split one entree but try two!! We split everything and it was a great way to have the best of both worlds. \n\nWe didn't come close to finishing, but we tried! Everything was really good. The huevos were full of tender sausage, flavorful sauces, and was mild enough for those afraid of heat to enjoy. The French toast was like a dessert-- the vanilla syrup needs to be bottled and sold. \n\nI'm gonna leave you with one final thought. When you come-- and you should!-- Get the orange juice. I promise you will love it.",

  "text": "I LOVE Good Friends!!! Easily one of my favorite bars in NOLA - easily!\n\nOur very first night at the bar was kind of a mixed bag - and probably not so great a first impression. We came here looking to find a place to watch some football for the NFL season opener. Was not meant to be. Saints rule the place. So the classification \"Sports Bar\" is kind of a misnomer. Suggestion to Yelp - devise a new business category - \"Saints Bar\". Every bar in NOLA should be put under that :o)\n\nSo after night 1, we realized this was Not a Sports Bar. And ended up going to an actual Sports bar to watch the game after finishing the first beers that we ordered. But didn't want to not go here because the vibe in the main bar downstairs felt great. AND I am also the kind of person who gives things / people / situations a second chance (ooh thank you Master for the consideration!). Came back the next night and had a blast. Met some fun locals. Made new friends. And the bartenders downstairs - Really make it worth the time spent here. So here are my rankings for the ones I met - starting with the best!\n\nRobert - He is a rock star. Makes a kick ass spicy Bloody Mary and a great dude! \nMichael - a close second - super super super nice guy (and that smile btw?!)\nKhrystian (so sure I am spelling it wrong but I know it starts with a K) - next best thing after Rob n Mike. Quite fast, works hard, remembers what guests drink, has the needed sass to put people in their place - LOL. Work it K!\nJoseph - yes, K&J are good trouble at the bar together and they probably know it too\n\nLoved the 2nd night so much that we were sure we had to come to the Saints Bar to catch the actual NOLA sports. So was there on time for the Saints kick off last Sunday. And boy does this town know how to celebrate their Saints. I get it. We do the same for our Pats (after all - we are Winners!!). But I have to say NOLA does Saints so much more than any other town I have been to. And clearly this bar takes it to a different level.\n\n* On the house Hot Dogs with Chili and all the fixings during the Saints game!\n* Free Shots for everyone for every Saints TD!\n\nI don't think I have ever rooted for any other team other than the Pats the way I was rooting for the Saints last Sunday. Too bad they lost, but for the sake of the locals and tourists alike, I hope the Saints kick some as$ in NFC this season. And anyone and everyone should go to Good Friends to enjoy Saints football.\n\nOther side notes. They play good music videos although the DVDs are rotated and if you spend more than a couple of hours here, or come back the next day at around the same time, you may end up seeing the same loop of songs - rewind and replay! But the crowd is fun. And if the management can do something about videos on demand / requests, that would make this place super stellar. Hey, but nobody is perfect. And for what Good Friends is right now - it is pretty damn good!!",

Back then the only business along that stretch of road was a convenience store. Times have changed. The entrance is well marked and the gallery has expanded. One recent change, after 50 years there is now an admission charge. Personally I think this was long overdue, but people aren't happy about it. Exhibits change throughout the year and you come to appreciate the depth of work created by Ted DeGrazia. When we first moved to Tucson you would often see Ted wandering around and he would happily provide you with an autograph. The grounds are beautiful too. Sadly the chapel was severely damaged in a 2017 fire. Too many unattended candles honoring deceased loved ones. One day it will be rebuilt, but many of the beautiful murals were damaged. This is a must stop to take our out of town visitors. Family membership is only $55 a year and you receive four guest passes. Please consider supporting this Tucson Treasure.",

The employees actually seem happy to be there, and I love how they all provided honest feedback and recommendations of various products.. \n\nDuring a recent visit I was in search of cheeses for an appetizer cheeseboard I was creating for my upcoming birthday dinner. I wish I could remember her name, but the employee who helped me was beyond helpful and so knowledgeable about cheese. The blue cheese Stilton and bacon cheddar are a MUST try. I can not thank her enough.\n\nThis is a place you have to go and just explore. Don't be afraid to try new things.  They seriously have items your couldn't even image. Additionally, they have a nice selection of wine and beer ranging in price. You can pick up a bottle of the infamous \"2 buck chuck\" to higher end items. \n\nI couldn't seriously go on and on and on and on about this place, but you simply MUST go and experience it for yourself.",

Jaidyn's Wings truly puts together wings that are rich in flavor, nice in size and not super pricey. You get quality wings for a good price and that's just what I like!\n\nI ordered Jaidyn's for the first time via UberEats a few weeks ago as I was craving chicken wings. I winded up ordering an order of the 10 piece wings with two flavors: lemon pepper and New Orleans Hot. The N.O. hot is similar to a typical hot wing flavor, but with an extra kick! I really liked it as it paired well with the ranch dipping sauce. I also ordered some Cajun ranch fries on the side which were too good!!! Not everyone does these kind of fries well in the city, these were fire though. And of course I had to get a beverage. Since I love tea, I went with the \"Nino's Sweet Tea\" and it was so so good. Not sure what the special ingredient is in that tea, but I need a whole gallon of it!",

I fell in love with Zumba, and just kept on coming back. \n\nIn fact, all the group classes (kickboxing, step, P90X, yoga) are pretty good, but I'm pretty much a member of the gym for Zumba. The regular weekday Zumba instructors, Loretta and Tommy are the best! And Mary Kay's class on Sunday is also a lot of fun. There's a class on Saturdays, but it's at 8AM, and that's just a bit too early on a Saturday. There are a ton regulars, but everyone is in the class is super friendly, which is nice if you're new to Zumba. I would not hesitate to bring newbies to the classes. \n\nThe gym facilities are nice, and there's plenty of treadmills, ellipticals, and bikes, but I'm not a frequent user of the equipment. Also, there are personal trainers and massage therapists, but I have not taken advantages of these added services. \n\nThe staff at the front desk are really friendly, as well as most members of the gym. This is a place where you go to workout and have a little fun doing it, but it's not a scene. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good gym in the Carillon area, or a fabulous Zumba class with great instructors and participants.

At that time, I was told the biscuits were being swapped for bagels; today I was told they're going back to biscuits! Having had both I can confirm it doesn't matter; both are excellent! The biscuits are large and the sandwich was filling and super satisfying with the addition of the spicy and sweet jalapeno jelly. I hope bagels return once in a while; I enjoyed the texture and my sandwich incorporated fresh veggies, giving me that smug feeling for having something healthy early in the day.\nWhat I really love at Coat Check are their lattes. Especially the ginger. Drinks like these are a treat for a black coffee kind of gal like myself but if I'm feeling like I deserve one Coat Check is the place. Perfectly balanced, not too sweet and when they return to regular service in ceramic mugs, beautiful foam art. Truly a treat! \nService is always great here.

  "text": "This was our first stop of the day Saturday for their newly released Christmas Cherry. My wife loves cherry wines. It was a little floral for my tastes but she loved it. \n\nI have to admit I underestimated this winery in the years I drove by it I always thought their wines couldn't be that good based on the fact that the grapes grow along side the interstate. However the Indiana grown wine trail forced me to try it out a few months back. They actually do have some really good wines. My two favorite dry reds are the petit Syrah & the Foch. My two favorite sweeter wines are the rhubarb & pleasant view which is a strawberry. We also both really love the cranberry crush. \n\nAll of that being said I do have some serious negatives. This place is always packed. To the point we both have turned around at the door and left. We somehow managed to stop late on a Sunday last time and only a couple others where there. Yesterday being a Saturday was Insane. They need to have more staff and/or another bar. My biggest complaint was that (I think it may have been the owner) stood there talking about the colts instead of serving people. He asked for my first selection 3 times and never even poured it. Finally the lady working the long line at the register and serving samples took pity on me. I paid for 5 samples but gave up after 3 because I was so annoyed. I don't mind so much having to wait to get up to the bar on busy days but being completely ignored while standing at the bar, wine glass sitting empty in front of me does very much send me over the edge.  If I could rate the service separately they would get 1 star.",

I got a half sandwich which was perfect for a normal portion lunch, but when it comes to eating po-boys, too much is never enough! I loved the rich flavor and the chips to go with it. It has such a down-home style feel and really cozy. Will be back!",

  "text": "Laumeier is definitely a St. Louis original - not sure of how many open air sculpture parks exist in the U.S., let alone the world! Not sure how many acres of land Laumeier sits on, but it's a LOT! And I love the fact that they are very \"hands off\" with letting people roam the grounds. As long as you don't harm the grounds or the pieces of art (OR do something really stupid in front of others), attendees can pretty much do whatever they want here. \n\nThis is a perfect picnic spot in the warmer months, but also a fun place to explore when it's cold. I'm not one to really enjoy physical activity, but hiking around Laumeier is one of my favorite things to do, no matter what time of year. Standing next to the sculptures puts our existence in the world into perspective, too. \n\nStopped by here last night for the opening reception to the Art Fair and it's really impressive to see that much land covered with tents, art, and people. It was windy and chilly last night and there were still 500 people there - at least! Hope that even more stop by over the weekend to support this awesome and FREE park in STL!",

  "text": "We love Tini!\n\nThe first thing you should know about Tini is that there's more to it than meets the eye.  Upon first glance, you see a tiny little neighborhood bar with a great outdoor seating area.  What savvy Tini goers know is that you're only seeing a part of the story.\n\nTini is actually a double-bar, and the other half of the space is open on weekends and during busy times.  Tini also features a nightclub on it's second level.  If booming bass and high energy are your thing, be sure to check it out.  \n\nTini is located on Mass Ave, and that same unique Mass Ave energy is more than present within it's walls.  Between the constant visual stimulus on the video screens, and the ever-present music pumping through the sound system, you're sure to bust out a dance move, or two.  The staff are also extra friendly, and the custom cocktails are a delight.  Pop on in and give Tini a try!",

  "text": "Had a $25 gift card for this BYO spot so we decided to give it a try. Purchased the guacamole appetizer which was a small portion. It tasted nice, but i wished it was bigger in size. The appetizer nachos with chicken were the nights hit. These bad boys were piled mile high and loaded with cheese, beans, sour cream and guac. I could have just eaten the nachos, but being the true fatty I am we all ordered tacos too lol. The table had two orders of the al pastor tacos and I got the shrimp tacos. Everyone shared. Overall the tacos were a solid 3.5/5. My only complaint was that the shells were too soft so the tacos kept falling apart. \n\nI do love that this is a BYO spot. It adds to its charm. Most people order to-go orders. During our time here there was only one other table sitting inside.",

  "text": "Planned an evening out with some friends and we decided to give this place a try. I love wine and all but this place is about 20 minutes away from my home and in a different part of town so I guess maybe this is why I've never given it a shot. We got here on a Wednesday about 7:30. Parking was a joke. I know I can't blame them for it but parking is just a pain. After searching for about 15 minutes I found something up the street. There's a doorman carding you when you walk up. Once you get inside you see nothing but wines and then there's a fridge with cheese on your left and then straight ahead a counter to order. Walking in as an outsider this is a very different experience. We decided to go outside to explore. Once we got outside there's not many tables and lots of humans. It seemed as if all the tables were taken. There was a nice band playing that night . Meanwhile my friends and I were just standing around in confusion. A man that worked there who was sooo nice walked up to us and asked if we needed help. I guess he saw how confused we were. Lol. He explained how we could order wine and food at the front room where we walked in. He then also explained that if we were looking for a table we would have to be like hawks or we could go upstairs where they had indoor seating, and that they served cocktails at the bar . After searching for a table for about 10minutes we gave up and decided to go back to the front. Upon entering there another nice man approached us after he heard me complaining about not finding a table and encouraged us to just try and get a table. So we went back outside to see if anything was available again and still nothing. We threw in the towel and decided to go upstairs. We luckily found 3 chairs at the bar and sat there. They did offer some glasses/bottles of wine but no cheese plate like they do downstairs. I did order some shrimp dip tho! So yummy! The bartenders up there were really nice as well. Overall I'm sad I couldn't really experience the outside atmosphere and get that cheese plate that I had been waiting for but next time I will get there earlier. Everyone was SuPERRRR nice! Great staff from what we encountered! I will be back!",

This was a travesty that had to be righted, and fortunately our friends came over and insisted that we pick up some food to bring back to the house. Clesi's did NOT disappoint, and is now on our list of awesomeness in Mid-City. \n\nWe ordered a ridiculous amount of food (and we had about eight days worth of leftovers). \n\n1. The Jambalaya Cheese fries - we laughed about this. Then we got serious. Could we really pass them up? The answer - hell no. Take a chance. You may hate yourself later, just a little, but in the moment? You'll be REALLY GLAD. \n\n2. Catfish Thibodeaux - this was insanely good. Perfectly cooked catfish, and the sides were great, too. \n\n3. Fried seafood platter - well, the name leaves little to the imagination, and you know what you're in for. Ya'll probably know, though, that some do it well, and others not so much. Clesi's does it well. Shrimps had the heads on! YAAAAAAAS. \n\n4. House salads - They were salads.

  "text": "I was having a major craving for soup so when the chance to try Minato Noodles came up, I gladly went for it. And I'm glad I did! I really loved it when it was Minato Sushi so I wondered how I would feel about the noodle house. \n\nWe started with karaage and takoyaki. Both were new experiences for me- having lived in Winnemucca most of my life, the most contact I had with foods like these was from watching Bizarre Foods! I was pretty excited about the takoyaki because my kids and I had just recently been talking about it and watching videos of it being made. I didn't realize Minato had them! I'm excited to take my kids in to try them sometime soon. They were pretty good, too. They're just such an interesting dish to me, like savory pancake batter with bits of octopus inside, made into balls and fried, with sauces and bonito flakes on top. I wonder if they flip them as fast as the guys in the videos my kids and I watched. Just remember- the inside of the takoyaki is a temperature comparable to the surface of the sun. Proceed with caution. Oh, the karaage was nice too- crisp outside, tender inside. Basically a Japanese chicken nugget!\n\nI decided on the seafood udon and was very pleased with that. The noodles are wonderful- chewy and flavorful; and there was a good amount of seafood in the soup. The broth though. You guys, THIS is the reason I love Asian soups. There is just so much flavor there! So rich and delicious. I added a little chili oil to give it a bit of a kick. Yum! And the portion was huge- I couldn't finish it all (and trust me, I can put the food away). \n\nI am excited to go back and try some other things on the menu- like the spicy sesame ramen. That sounds so good and I'm sure we will be going soon, as the kids are eager to try",

This is the third year I've attended and it just gets better each year (from my point of view). \n\nBefore the races, there's a free group ride, sponsored by CIBA. The courses are marked, you get cue sheets, and you can even download the route from MapMyRide. There's even a SAG stop! I love any excuse to down some Oreos that doesn't involve me bringing that cookie-crack into my house. We did the 35-mile ride this year and had a pretty good time. Essentially we rode up to Zionsville on back roads and back by way of Lafayette Rd. \n\nThe course itself is kind of figure-8 shaped, like 2 squares that are touching corners. There are divisions for men and women, Masters (40-50+ year olds), juniors (under 18), tandems, and various categories of actual racers. Competition is fierce among the pros and it's REALLY exciting to watch them tear around those corners. Don't we need more excuses to throttle cow bells and scream? It's very therapeutic. \n\nThere's live music, there are some vendor booths, there's free yoga, there's a BMX stunt show. \n\nThere are a variety of food trucks plus Sun King drafts. Some exercise, music, a Cream Ale, Tandoori Tacos, Lick Ice Cream...what else do you need to make your Saturday totally awesome? \n\nThere's even free bike parking in a supervised corral! If you hate everything I just mentioned, you're probably weird...so you might just dig watching all the people walk around in spandex. AAAAALLLL SPANDEX!",

There much be nigh 1000 beers in this place, ranging from the quotidian through the sublime. I picked up a bottle of italian beer here bottled in 2008. \n\n2) the taps - they have a set of 20 some taps in the back where they will pour you beer by the glass or fill growlers. The lineup is constantly changing and has something for everyone. \n\n3) the format - related to the taps in the back, this place is BYOF (food). You can bring food from any of the neighboring places in and eat at a high top or at the counter, while drinking something from their tap selection. What a good idea!\n\n4) the people - everyone who works here is very nice and knowledgeable. They seem to know just about every beer they have and its location, which is pretty amazing. Also, if you call, they are super friendly and helpful. \n\nThe prices can be a little on the high side sometimes, but I gladly pay the premium to support a local business that gets everything so right. \n\nIt's worth noting that I don't live anywhere near here and I regularly make the trip out.

I ordered chicken and waffles, it was a single soggy waffle but the three chicken wings it was served with were OK. My husband ordered grits and catfish. The catfish was fresh and good however the grits were watered down and runny with a scorch like flavor. When brought to the waitresses attention, she agreed that the grits were \"soupy\" today.  Idk why in knowing that they would not make another batch.   I found most hole in the wall places to be a fave, however not this one.",

  "text": "Great place to stop for some good food, good beer, and good conversation.\n\nI have to echo what my friend, Kristi S., wrote in her review. I completely agree that I'm open to giving this place five stars because I have the feeling this place will wow me. Maybe one day I'll look back at this review and think, I was an idiot, but my visit here was a solid four stars, which still makes me a fan!\n\nIt was a 30 minute wait for indoor seating on a Saturday night. They definitely double downed on the outside seating, since I would say the size of the indoor seating is the same as the size of the outdoor. I have a huge fear of mosquitos (hey we live in Florida!) so the day I decide I'm ok with getting Zika is the day I'll sit outside in the summer. (If I know I will have to sit outside I will bathe in bug spray and everyone dining with me has to deal with the smell.) Luckily, there is a long communal table that is first come first serve, so I didn't have to sit outside (which is also first come first serve) or wait the thirty minutes. \n\nMy friend and I both went with the flight of four beers, deciding to share. This means we got to try a total of eight beers. We're dark beer drinkers, so this means we tried every porter/stout/brown ale they had on their menu (and then had to pull a couple non-dark beers to hit our eight). Honestly, I enjoyed them all. Some of the beers are seasonal and tbh, when I do beer flights unless the beer name is written down in front of me, I can't keep them straight. You'll have to come and try them yourself.\n\nI got the Beer B Q Turkey Burger. Maybe this is my fault, since it is in the name, but I wasn't a fan of the beer b q sauce. I found it overwhelming. It also came with fried jalapenos which I picked out (I am not a spice person). The bun was perfectly buttered. I honestly planned to just pick at the bun, but I ate the whole thing! If you're on a diet and think you have willpower, you're wrong and should just order it without the bun. I got the cheesy mashed potatoes as my side and man they were cheesy! I loved it. \n\nI had serious food envy as I watched other plates pass by me. The calzones were ginormous! Seriously, that could feed a family. The pretzels looked huge as well! That's an entree size and then some. They don't skimp on portions here.\n\nI definitely enjoyed this place. I'm a fan!",

  "text": "Let me start out by saying that I will definitely be coming back to The Shake Seafood! The food was BOMB! AMAZING! DELICIOUS! TASTY! \n\nMy friend had been craving like a seafood boil and so we researched places in Philadelphia and this place seemed to best fit what we were looking for.\n\nMuch to our surprise, this place not only met..but exceed our expectations! We both got a combination with the snow crab legs and shrimp. Each combo comes with corn on the cob and/or potatoes. I love how you have the option to pick. I added 1/2 lb sausage in mines for about $5 and my friend added crawfish in her's. You get to choose from 3 different seasonings:cajun, garlic butter, & lemon pepper. Or you can combine all three for the shake house blend. I decided to go with the house blend. And since I was unsure of their spice level, I chose medium.\n\nWe came on a Saturday evening around 5:30ish and the wait was about an hour. The restaurant is not big at all so I can see how the wait was so long, but thankfully it's in a shopping plaza where you have a plethora of stores to walk around and kill time. Parking was not much of an issue considering it is in a strip mall.\n\nWe did not have any issues with service during our visit. Our server was very tentative and also other staff members. \n\nIf you're in the north Philly area and want a good seafood boil, try The Shake Seafood.",

Makes it easier for both! Their sushi burritos are to die for, and I feel fresh and light whenever I eat here! Everyone is really nice! The black man working here has such a great energy I love his vibe! But everyone is great! It's right next to my job! \n\nOnly down side (which isn't their fault just a heads up) is the area. There's always random homeless people wandering the parking lot, and today a woman came in right up to a table of people. Immediately and politely he came up to her and spoke to her about it. I love how he was respectful to both the table and the homeless woman versus being rude to her, as despite being homeless she's a person too. He respected her by pulling her outside to quietly speak with her. \n\nThis place is amazing! I apologize in advance because I'm going to be here every day",

  "text": "Stopped in to get some donuts for hubby's birthday late morning on a Friday.  This is a nice size place and a nice addition to Carrollwood.  A non-chain donut and restaurant shop that serves breakfast and lunch type foods. \n\nI don't frequent the chain donut places as I'm more into healthy eating, but will splurge on occasions.  \n\nThe donuts were very yummy and they offer the usual and not so usual. Cereal crusted and bacon topped is not my thing but I liked the boston cream. They have unique Sammy's of grilled cheese on a donut. And burgers on a donut. Not my idea of good eats but I'm sure there is a market for these state fair type of foods. \n\nThe display case of donuts could use revamping as they have different prices for specialty and not clearly marked as to what is special as opposed to regular but I'm sure they will work out the kinks of that eventually. Also ordered a dozen and ended up short one so will check next time before getting home. \n\nHubby loves the huge cinnamon roll and grandson loves the apple fritter. Both are humongous and can be shared easily.",

  "text": "Monday after Monday the organizers of 'Triple M' pull off an incredible evening of healthy living, by bringing hundreds of Tucsonans into the heart of downtown for a walk/run, rain or shine and holidays too! \n\nWithout a doubt, this social walk/run has become one of my favorite reasons to put on a pair of workout shorts and tie up my Mizunos. Check-in begins at 5:15, with the walking and running groups taking off shortly after that. The scenic trail traverses through some of downtown's most well known (and a few hidden) neighborhoods. Walkers and runners reconvene around 7 for live music and a free raffle. THAT'S RIGHT! Prizes for good health! What's not to love? And if that wasn't enough, show up seven times and you'll be the proud owner of a Meet Me At Maynards T-shirt. Run with your shirt on anywhere in the world, snap a shot and they'll throw it on the website. Run with your shirt off and......well......if you can run with your shirt off you've already won. I on the other hand am still in training so it'll be a while. \n\nWalking or running not your thing? They recently added a slew of other activities for a small cost. How about yoga for four bucks, or spinning for five? Does Zumba rhythm get your heart pumping? That class is three bucks or you can take a pilates class for five. Be sure to check in though, because with the red MMM that they stamp to your palm, you'll get discounts at participating restaurants. Bring the kids, bring your dog, everyone is welcome.\n\nSo to recap, a free walk/run, seven times you get a shirt, cheap fitness classes if you aren't a runner, and discounts on food. I'll see you next Monday, right? That's what I thought.",

Arriving just as it opened at 11:30, I walked into an empty dining room and was greeted by a friendly Asian woman who welcomed me and confirmed I could dine outside on their umbrellaed patio. Seemed like the safer way to go in this renewed age of raging Delta Covid. \n\nI went with faves, Tom Kha Soup and Drunken Noodles (veggie), 'Thai Spicy'. They threw in a sushi orange ginger dressing salad, which was a surprise. The Tom Kha was excellent, with plenty of fresh mushrooms, sliced chicken, carrots, onion, coconut milk and lemongrass for kicks. Loved each and every slurp. The Drunken was a large plate with extra wide noodles and lots of colorful veggies.\n\n It also came with plenty of cubed tofu pan sauteed to a near burnt finish. The heat was there, although not the conflagration desired. The taste of the overdone tofu while subtle, was enough to through the flavor of the dish slightly off. So, while it was still recognizable, it could have been much better with a more deft hand holding the pan. \n\nBhan Thai is a reasonable facsimile of a genuine attractive Thai restaurant, but candor requires referencing that better can be found in and around Philly, Central Jersey, and closer to home. \n\n3.75 STARS.",

  "text": "My lady recently moved to this area and every time I drove by I knew it was busy so it had to be good, right? \n\nOverall I'd say yes. Mostly hits with one big miss.\n\nHad to start with their famous chicken wings. Organic, never frozen. Medium buffalo had enough heat. Got order of 10 but one piece looked really scary like a zombie Chicken wing so that was left uneaten.\n\nThe miss was the onion rings. Despite being told these were not frozen that was not the case. There is NO WAY these aren't frozen and then fried. We hardly touched them. \n\nMy lady got a salad. She loved it. \n\nI'm a sucker for a great Mac and cheese and their bacon/Tomatoe was delicious - the highlight of the meal. I did take that to go and we ate it the next day and it was great.\n\nShe had 2 glasses of wine and I tried one of their drink concoctions (too sweet) and then a bottle of the now famous Not Your Fathers Root Beer which at 5.9% alcohol was very tasty. \n\nService was fair. Could have been better.\n\nWe shall return to try the burgers which looked great on the menu and the in-house made roast beef. It's a nice place with a great beer list and an above average bar menu. They have been there for years and take pride in what they do.",

  "text": "Favorite spot in Donelson! Always in the mood for their beer and food! \n\nFor beer I love the groovy shade but sometimes it's fun getting flights to mix it up. Crowlers are available and we also bring a growler to fill up sometimes. \n\nLOVE the pickle pizza!! Usually get half that and salami picanti  Wings are so good as well as the cheese curds. Need to try the sandwiches but it's hard to not order pizza every time!\n\nThe only downfall is that they need an area where you can casually grab a beer and just hang out rather then sitting at a table. Not sure if that's an option for this space but would love it if it was!!",

  "text": "Amazing concept for all ages! You don't want to miss this place! \n\nThis is one the best times Tyler and I have had for a date night in a while. We stopped into Kingmakers for a yelp event on a Saturday afternoon around 5 pm. It wasn't very busy when we walked in (as it got later the entire place became busy and very lively) and we were greeted and seated quickly. After being told of how Kingmakers works and being informed of the $5 library fee,our sommelier talked to us about what kind of game we want to play. We were brought three games and each was explained. We chose the most interesting one and then we're taught how to play it! This was perfect because we learned something new without reading all of those instructions no one ever reads. If we had any questions our sommelier checked on us and we were able to ask her anything. We stayed for about three hours and played three different games. \n\nWhile there Tyler ordered a local beer that he hadn't tried before but loved. I ordered the best dirty chai I have ever tasted. I could go back for that drink alone. We didn't order any food because we ha a large lunch earlier but they offer snack food if you are hungry. \n\nI cannot wait to go back to Kingmakers. This is definitely a hidden gem in Indy that more people should know about. Bring one other person or bring a group and expect to pay $5 per person plus drinks ranging from $3.50-7.50. It can be cheaper than a movie and way more fun!",

We stopped by and we're surprised by how much we enjoyed the pizza. \n\nWe got a large Margherita pizza and loved the cheese and crust. It came out piping out and pretty quick. We have already come back and gotten another too. The pizza is pretty greasy, but I think that's also might be what makes it so good. Excited to try some of the more unique pizzas too. \n\nThe interior space is pretty and there are big tables for families and groups as well. It's very modern, comfortable and chill. They have a big craft beer list and it includes several local breweries. \n\nDefinitely come check them out!",

  "text": "I would have liked to rate Trenasse 3.5 stars, but because of the service and atmosphere, I think this place is better than 3 stars. I visited Trenasse for a group brunch on a Saturday afternoon. Our server was excellent! I ordered the Boudin Hash and Eggs. When it arrived, it was visually appealing. The hash had good flavor, but they were super stingy with the potatoes. It was also just barely warm. My syrup was the hottest thing on my plate. The eggs were bland even with the cheese added. The bacon was delicious. The menu said it was sweet bacon, but it tasted more like a peppery bacon. Either way, I loved it! The biscuit was weird. It had the potential to be good, but was a bit too salty and the bottom half was dry. Overall, it was a decent breakfast and I would probably get it again.",

  "text": "I have eaten here a half a dozen times now and have had mostly terrific experiences.  I love their charcuterie, their boudin, and the oyster salad.  I have had great duck here as well.  I ordered the 1/2 chicken previously and it was murdered, dried out, overcooked and buried in so much bacon you couldn't taste anything else.  The dish was really heavy and heavy handed.  I ordered it again and it was succulent and beautiful, the veggies were a little crisp but this was a complete turn around for this dish.\n\nWe like to go for happy hour and usually enjoy the discounted oysters.  On one visit they were all so small as to be comical and it was hard to believe they would serve them and charge us for them.  Still, overall, I am a huge fan.  It's hard to judge a restaurant on a single visit and I try not to do it too harshly when I see that so many things are going well there and how obviously they know how to prepare and serve a quality product.  The bacon does not contain nitrates or sulfites and much of the product served is organic.  I really appreciate the effort to make sure that I am eating safe food John.  Thank you!",

First we had a 50 minute wait.... then we got sat (Party of 7) split among two tables and then the two waters were drama and after were sat and kids were coloring, they asked us to move. They crammed us into a table... the server was not polite. They brought out our order and several things were wrong. Of those things, a friend ordered a portabella burger (she's a vegetarian) and it came out with meat and when she asked the waitress about it, she got an attitude and said it comes with meat. After some discussion she said she'd get it brought out without meat. We also sat around waiting for drinks. All the adults were having drafts or ciders but it was a real challenge to get more. Our service was some of the worst we've ever had. To say I'm disappointed is putting it lightly. The margarita pizza came out and it looked like a totinos version of a flatbread. It was awful.",

Luckily, the donuts here are AMAZING!  \n\nThis review is just for the donuts, I have never had their cakes or pastries.  Make sure you have cash because this place doesn't accept credit cards.  There is an ATM in the gas station across the street, but it's just best to make sure you have a few bucks.  \n\nBe prepared to wait.  I have never been to Long's and not waited in a line.  Luckily, you're waiting inside a bakery so it smells delicious.  They have a good variety of donuts (glazed and blueberry cake are my personal faves) at really great prices.  I don't think I have ever paid more than 5 bucks for my haul.  \n\nEveryone knows and loves Long's donuts.  Last month I brought donuts to my co-workers and they all asked me \"LONG'S????\"  Unfortunately since I moved up to Broad Ripple, they weren't from Long's, and I had some sad faces in the conference room .\n\nAll in all:  Worth the wait and the hassle to bring cash!",

I love the 2 long high communal tables and tons of electric outlets placed under them. The only complaint I have, which is the same for all Starbucks, is the temperature. It's FREEZING in there. It might actually be colder at this location than most. Recently I was there for 2 hrs, even with a cardigan on, I left a popsicle. I'm not kidding.\n\nWhy 4 stars and not 5? A couple of employees could be more cheerful and sociable. They actually look like they don't enjoy working, period. The whole time I was never, I never saw either of them smiled once. Maybe I shouldn't be too critical as long as my drinks are done right.\n\nThe parking lot is still small since this Starbucks is in a tiny plaza. There's no changing this since there's no room to expand around this plaza. I usually park in the back in case people scratch or hit my car when they try to squeeze into the small spaces.\n\nLooking forward to hanging at this location more. And I'll be bringing a coat. Ha!",

  "text": "We went here for Coolinary and loved it. We were seated in the best seat in the house, right in the center of the first floor dining room with a view of the bar. I loved the French Quarter type feel inside with the very old chandelier, high ceilings and windows, and old pictures hanging on the walls. The 1800's mansion has a romantic feel about it but the place is a little loud. Curtains on the windows could help with that.  Service and food was fantastic. We ordered the gumbo and fritters for apps. I loved the gumbo...it had a thick and dark roux. The fritters were ok, I liked the dream fraishe sauce with it. The entrees were fried chicken sandwich and shrimp and grits. Fried chicken was amazing with that blue cheese aioli sauce. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, I was just ok with the curry grits. The dessert we both got the key lime pie which was very sour and good. There is a $15 wine pairing option and the first glass was a rose, second was a sparkling rose and last was a port called feist? Anyway, we were very happy with everything - ambience, service and meal. We will be back.",

  "text": "We celebrated my boyfriend's birthday here last night and I couldn't wait any longer to write my review. This place amazed us. \n\nFood: This is not your typical restaurant. If you have never done a tasting menu before, I highly suggest you look into them before making a reservation or writing a review here. I saw some reviewers say that the price was not worth it, but I have a feeling some of those reviewers have never done something like this before and therefore didn't know what to expect. The dishes at this restaurant will present you with flavors and ingredients you have probably never had before, which is exactly what I love about it. The chefs must have put a ton of thought into each dish: every single plate I had was incredible and unique. I am a pescatarian and the staff was extremely accommodating. I had some of the best lobster, crab, and other seafood dishes I have ever had, and did not feel like I was missing out at all. \n\nDrink: The wine pairing was absolutely perfect. The best wine pairing we have ever done. Each wine complimented its dish perfectly. And we loved that they included some a variety of types, including a delicious skin contact wine. The sommelier was lovely! \n\nAtmosphere: We loved the setting of the restaurant. The bar beside the restaurant was the perfect place to get cocktails before our table was ready. The dining room itself is very intimate. We loved watching the food prepared right in front of us, with only a handful of other guests. Every detail - right down to the plating choices - was purposeful. And do NOT leave until you've used their bathroom... Just trust me. \n\nStaff: We were entranced by the work ethic of every single employee at the restaurant. Everyone was warm and communicative, which is hard to do when there is so much food prep to be done. The restaurant truly felt like a well-oiled machine. \n\nI can say that this was one of the best dining experiences we've ever had, with some of the most memorable and delicious dishes we've ever eaten. I highly recommend dining here if you are interested in trying something completely different, are open to eating the unexpected, or if you simply love this style of dining like we do.",

  "text": "Yes, this is yet another update. Yes, I spent yet another Saturday at the salon. No, I don't live there, though it's starting to seem like I should have weekend Paul Mitchell slumber parties.\n\nBecause my stylist from the appointment before already was booked, I was assigned to Sabrina for my color fix. Right off the bat, Sabrina was awesome. She really listened to me as I described the color I was going for and the problems with the last visit. She consulted with not one but two learning leaders on the best way to tackle the color re-do, and she offered plenty of her own know-how when talking with them. Sabrina seriously impressed me with her knowledge of chemistry and color cancellation.\n\nI wasn't planning on undergoing a second process that day, but we decided that instead of coating my now-dirty-brown streaks with a new Inkworks color, we should just go ahead and lighten them up. I was hesitant, as I only bleach the streaks once a year so I don't damage my hair too much, but after all the consultations, I realized that this was the best move. I appreciated that Sabrina looked at all the options before recommending that to me. \n\nThe best part is that Sabrina took her time. She didn't rush through the processes or make me feel like a nuisance as I asked questions. In fact, she left the Inkworks color on just a hair bit longer than normal, just because she wanted to make sure that it took to my thick, double-colored hair. And indeed, my streaks now are a lovely shade of bright fuchsia (during the previous visit, I had intended a color with a little more purple shading, but as we were mixing up color in the cup, I fell in love with this).\n\nSabrina will be graduating at the end of January or beginning of February, so I'm going to make sure that my next every-other-month Inkworks appointment happens before she leaves. \n\nAfter a week, I'm still disappointed about the cut - perhaps even more than I originally was. It's just too short, and it makes me sad when I look at it. I tried being clear with the previous stylist that I really didn't want to lose length and only wanted the dead ends gone, but some stylists just like to chop, I think. I need to be more forceful about keeping the length of my hair. That's why I'm leaving the rating at three stars for now.",

I still think snacks are over-priced and wish I could bring in my own picnic but that's OK. I'm over it now.  What I do love -- they lowered the entry cost and the monthly membership is SO much more reasonable.\n\nThey include the fun things going on for ALL the kids and things aren't extra now so if Mr. Daniel is playing that day, we ALL get to partake!  Love that!\n\nWe are spending on average 3 times a month here now and my daughter is obsessed. The owners are VERY hands on and offer crafts and will read to kiddos. They help mamas who just want to get some work done or sit back with their coffee and read a book.  I love that!  I love the neighborhood vibe.\n\nThings I have discovered:  Anyone under 6 will definitely enjoy this but over that, and they are probably too old.  Always plenty of parking which is a plus!  Great wi-fi.  Never get disconnected and the coffee is AMAZING.  Always good choices.  The owners care about the kids and the enjoyment of adults. Always friendly and incredibly approachable.\n\nI enjoy when it's NOT crowded....which is first thing at 9AM and mid-day after 1 PM.  Don't tell anyone else I gave you the inside scoop on that!\n\nHeaded there right now.....have a great day mamas and check this out!",

  "text": "4.5/5\n\nWhenever I visit from out of town, I always do my research on the best restaurants locally. I stumbled upon Suraya from various articles online stating it was one of the best restaurants in the Philadelphia area. Being huge foodies my boyfriend and I were stoked to try it out! \n\nAmbiance (5/5): Holy smokes, what a cute restaurant! Within the establishment there was a cafe surrounded by shelves with plants and spices for sale. The dining room itself was spacious and had a large chef's counter. The tasteful decor made it feel like you were in a Mediterranean country. I loved the Arabic calligraphy written randomly as it gave an authentic vibe.\n\nService (4.5/5): Our waitress was extremely friendly and helpful. She had a big smile on her face and kindly explained the menu to us. In addition, she checked up on us frequently to make sure we were enjoying our meal and that our water was filled. The reason why I knocked off a 0.5 is because my boyfriends drink showed up towards the end of our meal.\n\nFood (4.5/5): Being of Middle Eastern descent I can be a tough critic when it comes to Middle Eastern cuisine. We ordered Baba Ganoush, Slow-Roasted Lamb Hummus, Tabbouleh and the Kafta Kebob sandwich. I was a bit disappointed that there were no meat or poultry dishes listed on their menu. Granted we came for Brunch but meats are an important staple in Middle Eastern cuisine. The lamb hummus was absolutely delicious and the ingredients were so fresh. The lamb was cooked to perfection and the mint garnish gave it a nice bite. I was also a big fan of their baba ganoush. Who would have thought pomegranate would pair so well with the smokiness of the eggplant. The highlight of my meal was the tabbouleh as it was hands down the best I've ever had. It was earthy with the perfect amount of herb to quinoa ratio. The kafta kebob sandwich was okay, nothing to write home about. Overall, I was satisfied with what we ordered but had wished to see more main course entrees rather than sides. \n\nFrom the genuine service to the delicious food and the adorable ambiance- 100% recommend Suraya! I hope to see more dishes the next time I visit from out of town.",

  "text": "I really want to love Trax, especially to support local and hello, B.B.Q. However, after 4 trips, I can't say I love it. \n\nThe inside is cool, it's very rustic. Some of the tables are wobbly. The staff is okay. You won't leave saying, \"Wow, those people love their jobs!\" but they don't seem to hate  it. I think they just need to slow down and put a bit more emphasis on customer service. Come around, check on our food, give us a smile...that goes a long way and is so rare anymore (unless you're at a certain chicken establishment).\n\nThe prices are similar to what you'd find at any other bbq joint. A little high if you come alone, cheaper if you split a platter. \n\nThe sauces are vinegar based, so that's different. \n\nMy husband and I always split the the platter, which has 3 meats (you cannot choose two of anything), 2 sides, slaw (cannot substitute) and homemade pickles for $25. The pulled pork and chicken are pretty good. The ribs are VERY VERY spicy and should come with a warning. I love brisket but it's always extremely fatty, and I've ordered it as one of my meat choices each time, hoping for less fat each time. \n\nI'm a huge fan of hush puppies but they really lack any kind of flavor here (almost like plain fried dough). My husband got the fried potatoes last weekend, which is one of his all time favorite foods, and it came out burnt and hard with no flavor. The fries are decent. The green beans are a bit hard for my liking. They're not canned but fresh so they have quite a bite to them. The Mac is white cheddar with spiral noodles.\n\nThey have a kids menu of grilled cheese, cheeseburger, chicken fingers, or pulled pork sandwich, choice of a side. I wish this was posted online, I had to call to check. \n\nI tried the banana pudding last weekend, $6, came in an overflowing mason jar (cute presentation). The pudding was good, definitely made from scratch. It only had two little banana pieces, one vanilla wafer, and a little dollop of whipped cream. While the pudding itself was good, I craved more of the other items.\n\nI highly suggest they give you a number rather than walking around SCREAMING your name when your food is ready. Have little posts on the table where you can display your number like other places do. I've seen staff walk around frustrated for a while, probably because it's very loud inside and folks can't always hear their name. \n\nWith some tweaks, this could really be a great place for McCordsville.",

  "text": "Just a notch below the Bottleworks.\n\nI love Schlafly.  My fandom has gone on for nearly a decade.  During my early twenties, Tap Room became a starting point for a night full of shenanigans.  No one wants to start with the swill, so we would begin with some of the best craft beer in the nation.\n\nIt's hard to ingore the historical significance of the Tap Room, opening its doors in 1991.  It was the first time in nearly twenty-five years that someone other than Anheuser-Busch was brewing beer in St. Louis, a town once known for having about three dozen breweries prior to prohibition.  No one can take away what Tom Schlafly has done for this community and the culture of craft beer in St. Louis.\n\nHowever, once I discovered the Bottlesworks, I came to the realization that maybe Tap Room wasn't perfect.  For me, spacing is an issue.  They do have separate sections for food and bar.  I don't care for sitting on the restaurant side, and apparently other patrons share my preference.  I am constantly looking for somewhere comfortable to sit on the bar side.  Last time we were stuck by the dart players, and that made for some awkward moments!\n\nAlso, the staff at Tap Room doesn't appeal to me nearly as much as the Bottleworks.  Honestly, the bartender was kind of rude to me when we came in for the 21st birthday party.  I understand how busy they were that day, but this was not my first encounter with this woman.  She's been on staff for quite some time and is never very friendly or helpful.  I've never had any issue with the staff at Bottleworks.\n\nAs a positive final note, Tap Room offers private tours of the facilities, and it's a good time for anyone looking to try different brews than the basic sampler, which is all they offer at the end of the Bottleworks tour.  If you want to check out the tour, ask for Hannah.  She's a lot of fun!\n\nDrink local.  Drink Schlafly.",

  "text": "Nice little bakery specializing in FIlipino breads. Since keeping inventory fresh is a priority, everything is baked in small batches to ensure quality. I love siopao (pronounced shoe pow), which is basically a steamed bun with your choice of pork or chicken inside of it. The version they make here are massive. Best way to eat these are to keep them refrigerated, then wrap in a wet paper towel and nuke for about 2 minutes and they come out steaming hot and tasty.\n\nThey have a small steam table and have a handful of dishes. As is what seems to be a standard practice in every Filipino restaurant, none of the dishes were labeled, so it was a guessing game to figure out what each dish was. The owner was very helpful.  I ended up with some yummy pancit, jasmine rice and some sort of lechon (roast pork) dish. Everything was really good.\n\nMy only recommendation for improvement would be more labeling of food (so people who aren't so familiar with the food won't have to ask questions about every dish) and listing pricing.

  "text": "I used to love coming here, but it's been a few years since my last visit.  So on my way up from Miami to Tampa, I decided to see how Cru Cellars was doing.  Well, in my opinion, not very well.  In fact, I regret this latest trip.  We came in around 9:30pm on a Saturday, and the wine guy behind the bar made sure to let us know that the kitchen was closing in 20 minutes, as well as the bar.  I looked at the clock to confirm the time, and I went back to the front door, which clearly stated they close at 11pm.  I was confused, so my guest and I asked another person at the bar, a young blonde lady, \"what time do you close?\"  She answered something to the effect of: we are not Chili's, so as a small business we close whenever it is slow. \n \nSo ok... First, I hope you are not like Chili's because you do not have Chili's prices and that is not what your guests expect. Second, I totally understand small businesses may have the need to close earlier, but if your customers drive from far away to come to your business, and you advertise you are open at certain times online and on your front door, I would think that out of respect to your customers you would honor the times posted or simply state on your door/website that you close whenever you feel like it, and to call before coming by.\n \nThis was not an isolated incident.  After us, there were at least two couples who came in and were told: \"10 minutes before we close.\" They were just as puzzled as we were but perhaps a bit smarter because they decided to leave.\n \nIn addition, the staff acted (again, in my opinion) a bit snobbish by saying comments like \"you don't know what that is?\" when we asked to explain food items on their menu.  In my mind, if I am asking you to explain something, I probably do not know what it is.  Why are you working there if you don't want to help your customers?\n \nAlso be aware that their corkage fee for any bottle you buy at their market is $12.  I used to complain about Miami prices, but boy, never again....  If these are the prices here, coupled with bad service, it is as if they are encouraging you to buy the bottles and go home, no need to stay at their bar and consume anything else.  I'm puzzled!\n \nNeedless to say, the service was poor and we did not get to really try the food. It reminded me of the movie Pretty Woman when Julia Roberts goes to the store on Rodeo Drive and the staff tells her \"we don't have anything for you.  You are obviously in the wrong place.\"  An unfortunate experience.",

I tried the caprese sandwich which was delicious and so I was eager to actually go to the restaurant when a girlfriend suggested we cash in her free wine tasting. \nAs a wine club member, she explained she gets two free wine tastings a month. She also gets to select 2 bottles of her choice every month as a member. There are other additional perks and so I immediately agreed to become a member too, thinking in the back of my mind that the wine tastings would be a perfect excuse for me to force the boyfriend to eat here at least once a month ;)\nMy friend and I forgot to put our name on the wait list, and by the time we were done with our wine tasting, there was a 45 minute wait for a table. We opted to eat in the bar and within minutes of scoping out tables, a couple stood up to leave and we swooped in! Our server Theresa was very knowledgeable of the menu, and she had no issue with us taking our time with apps and catching-up. We split the pork belly nachos (OMG YUM) and the tuna tacos (FABULOUS!). We were still hungry, so we also got salads and split the trio of medallions entree. The meat was tender and perfectly cooked, but we really couldn't taste a difference in the three different crusts. Oh well. Still great.\nMy most recent visit, I wanted to be sure to get on the wait list before we finished our wine tasting, especially since I didn't get to see the whole restaurant the last time. Holy cow- the place is huge! And, to my pleasant surprise we were seated in Theresa's section - AND she remembered me coming in with my friend weeks prior! Very cool. Jeff wanted to try the nachos, I didn't hesitate. \nMy entrée. Oh my my my Cooper's Hawk you can sure make a great gnocchi. I had opted for the butternut squash gnocchi with the most delectable sage cream sauce and chunks of squash. Heavenly. Jeff had trouble deciding between the pistachio crusted grouper vs. the short rib risotto. Theresa suggested the risotto, and so he went with it. He wasn't blown away...the rib meat was a little overcooked which was disappointing, but he didn't let it ruin the meal. Next time, he will try the other.\nAnd there will definitely be a next time...and a time after that....",

They have about 9 different kinds of tacos and there are ones that you can get either grilled or fried. They have some good apps in the guacamole and they have Boylan's soda in the fountain machine which is amazing. If you sign up for their rewards program you get $10 off the next time you go in, which for me will be very soon. So we went on a Thursday night and got some guacamole and an assortment of tacos, chicken, shrimp, and all the different types of fish they had that day. Everything was grilled except for the house fish of the day (which was perch) I got one taco with it grilled and one with it fried to do a comparison. All the tacos were good, the shrimp tacos were awesome and there was a good amount of shrimp in each. I like the breading that they use to fry the fish and it isn't greasy but I think that I just still prefer to have everything grilled. All in all a great first experience and I am looking forward to the next one.",

  "text": "My husband's brother and his wife gave us a gift card as a wedding gift, so we finally used it last weekend. I love steak. I love the atmosphere of a good steak house. It's just that, well, I always feel like I'm getting ripped off. I know, I know, you are paying for the atmosphere and the service, but still.\n\nThat being said, service was fantastic. I even appreciated the smooth way in which our waiter corrected the junior server, when he tried to take away the wrong plates. Our waiter checked in on us during dinner as did 2 other people. While that might sound intrusive, it really wasn't. We were there during the basketball tournament, so everyone seemed surprised when we said we live downtown. I'm sure they're used to more of a business/tourist crowd.\n\nWe ordered the porterhouse for two, potatoes lyonaisse, onion rings and a bottle of red wine. Because it was my husband's birthday weekend, they brought a complimentary dessert of a chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream. All in all, with tip, the bill was just shy of $230. Granted, we could have saved ourselves $50-some by not ordering wine, but what is the fun in that? Thankfully I had our receipt handy, because the mall garage was charging $20 for parking, due to the tournament, but they only charged us $2. \n\nWould Ruth's Chris be a destination? Nah. But I enjoyed the experience and we had enough leftovers for lunch the next day.",

We just don't have bowling alleys like this back home.  \n\nIt was awesome!\n\nWe were across from a very nice, friendly, funny couple.  Usually I like my privacy, but it was cool to socialize with some new people.  We were in the walled off area (21+), which was kind of cool, because we didn't have to worry about children running around or anything. I love kids, but it was nice. \n\nThey had a bar area also, but it wasn't open yet when we arrived. I believe they told me it opened at 6. We had a great time! Thanks Woodland.",

Were else can you get lobster on your burger :) Choices here are many from the style fries you like to the bun your burger is on. Also has a full service bar so any drink you want is made to order. One downside is the fact that this place gets crowded and doesn't take reservations. tables are also small so may be hard to accommodate large groups.",

So, when I took a trip to Nashville, it was a must-visit.\n\nWe called well in advance and got reservations for an in-the-round night. We had dinner, though the food wasn't memorable, and the drinks were a bit over-priced. But the music is what makes this place what it is. \n\nAs other reviews have stated, the age of the songwriter is gone. But it's still great to hear good, live music. And during the in-the-round, the musicians were RIGHT THERE, touchable, not on a stage.\n\nI had a great time, and will go again if ever back in Nashville.",

Everyone said Peg Leg Porker. \nI ordered the half rack of dry rub ribs with the smoked green beans and the Mac and cheese, and my husband ordered the pulled pork platter with coleslaw and BBQ beans. Everything was delicious.\nI enjoyed the dry rub and also enjoyed putting their homemade BBQ sauce on them as well. The green beans were the flat Italian style beans which are my favorite, and the smoke flavor was not over powering. The Mac and cheese was very creamy. The pulled pork my husband had was very tender and great flavor. His loved his BBQ beans and the coleslaw was nice and creamy with nice flavor.\nThe prices were very reasonable, I wish I would have been able to save room for the fried pie, but we were stuffed.

  "text": "My coworker raves about this place ! My mind was set on tacos & I knew I wanted to try something different . We drove around east Nashville & I pulled up my trusty YELP app : ) local taco was nearby . The entrance is a little weird . It's located in a boutique strip . We saw the sign for the place but had to walk down the pathway to get there hoping we were walking into the right place lol . \nWe weren't necessarily greeted in a timely fashion . My friend & I stood there like ... Hmmm ok do we seat ourselves ? Do we wait to be greeted... We stood there for about 5 minutes before the guy came from around the counter . He handed us a menu to look at . Again , I wasn't sure when he was going to seat us . We looked over the menu , we chose the taco basket . It comes with two tacos & a side item . I got the southern fried & shrimp taco ( hold the slaw !) . My friend ordered the tequila lime tacos & collard greens . \nWe told the guy our order ..  We stood there for S minute or so again .. I looked around & there was plenty of seats ! I asked him where could we sit & he replied anywhere .. Hmmm ok . \nThe food didn't take long to come out . I enjoyed my shrimp taco & Mexican corn . Loved the spicy sauce . There was coleslaw on the taco which I asked for it to come without . I picked it off with my fork& kept eating ! The southern fried had more crispy skin then actual chicken . My friend loved his food , he couldn't stop talking about the spicy greens . My first experience threw me off . We decided to give it another chance . The second time was great . No slaw on my taco . The service was still a little off ...not understanding the disconnect when people walk in the door they should be greeted! Overall I give local taco 4 stars .. The house margarita on my last visit won me over .",

They were all perfectly cooked and delicious. \n\nThe reasoning for only three stars is because the drink was super super strong and made it a little difficult to drink and also...I know that this is a seafood place but we just wish there were more none seafood options for those who don't like seafood so they can enjoy the restaurant too. My husband got the chicken basket and that was pretty much the only thing on the menu that was not seafood. The chicken tasted really odd...not like it was rotten or anything but it tasted different. The fries were also not very much better either. \n\nI am not saying that I will not return...because I will but until they ( if they ever do) add more non seafood options I will have to find someone that loves seafood like I do to come with me.",

  "text": "Since it was my mother that went through the process of renting the car online, this review only pertains to the Alamo counter, pick up, duration of rental and return.\n\nAt the counter: what was a great deal at $89 became less of a great deal when the representative pitched us the \"full tank of gas\" deal (which actually was a deal because we drove it down to E during our stay) and the optional insurance. She reminded us \"Florida is a no-fault state\" and pressured us into spending the extra $50 -- although I'm sure had we not gotten it, we would have been hit on the way out of the airport (Murphy's Law?). So the total came to $189 for 6 days which truly isn't all that bad.\n\nPick up: We rented a compact car, and the woman at the counter informed us this would be a small Kia, Aveo, or something of the like. She directed us to the \"Compact\" section of the Alamo cars, and told us to pick whichever we wanted -- the keys would be in it. Well, we went out to the Compact area (easy to find, easy to get to) and we would have loved to have picked whatever we wanted... if there were any cars there! ALL of the compact spaces were EMPTY! Confused, we looked for other compact sections but there were none. We approached a different Alamo representative who told us to \"just take a midsize\". Not the best service but hey, we got a better car so that's a plus! Actually getting OUT of the Alamo lot was about as long and uncomfortable as getting a cavity search. The guy who took our paperwork just looked at both of us for at least 90 seconds without blinking, and then went 360 degrees around the car a handful of times making notes (without saying a word to us the whole time), jotting down more notes for another five minutes, and then sent us on our way a total of 15 minutes after we pulled up to the window.\n\nDuration: Our chariot was a pistachio-colored Ford Focus sedan and was a great ride -- AC worked well, radio was fine, seats were comfy, trunk was huge. What else can you ask for during a vacation? Power windows and locks. Definitely a good little car. Drove an average of 20 miles a day, maybe more, every day for 6 days (and two trips between Tampa Airport and Sarasota) one one tank of gas. \n\nReturn: Easiest part of the experience - we pulled in, the guy in line scanned the barcode on the windshield, they looked at the car, we left the keys, boom. Done.\n\nI'd recommend Alamo if you can get a great deal -- and the insurance is sort of a coin-toss. Do you need it? No. Am I always afraid the minute I don't get it I'll wish I did? Well.. yeah.",

  "text": "This is a lovely mom and pop, hole in the wall, and hidden gem :) \nFirst off, the employees are very informational, helpful, considerate, and understanding. They (Tiffany and Jon) took their time to explain to me the history of why this particular spa was initiated and how the owner wanted it as close to a traditional Korean spa. Initially, i was against participating in this experience but this changed after Speaking with Tiffany on the phone. My reservations laid primarily on the fact that one has to be wearing their birthday suit for the wet spa area (hot tub, cold tub, sitting shower, steam room, and body scrub). I was about to settle with just experiencing the dry spa area ( Himalayan salt room, clay room, kareoke room, regular pool, and common area). However, this being a request of the  Bride to Be for all of us to attend then I had to figure out how to participate and still maintain my comfort level. What convinced me to join was the professionalism, kindness, and welcoming attitude and conduct of Jon who welcomed the group of 8. Jon reassured us of the gender specific areas and what to expect once entering the areas (you pay and get the key for your lockers - 1 for your shoes and another for the rest of your items, then change clothes into their uniforms, rinse off if entering the wet spa area). This experience also brought our group (most of us were meeting for the first time) surprising close together. \n\nIf you want more of a private time then go during the morning when most people are at work and during the week. For a larger group it is best to call and organize ahead of time for scheduling purposes as there are only 2 available slots for customers. Jon was also able to allow us to organize a surprise for the bride by letting us decorate the kareoke room and provided area for a mini celebration area- he even was part of the surprise as he was willing to distract the bride. Jon even gave us free new masks as we had to throw ours away. That being said, I felt more comfortable with how the employees handle their guests. \n\nI also felt more confidence in their professionalism as I listened to the other customers and bridesmaids who went before me- they all have good report afterwards. \n\nAlthough this location isn't the most modern nor up to date facility- the experience proved to be of quality with great professional services. \n\nThe body scrub was amazing and the way you feel when you finish is worth it- it feels like you have baby skin and you feel very very relaxed. If at any time you feel anxious or uncomfortable or if the scrubbing is too rough- make sure to communicate this to the employee and they are happy and willing to accommodate you. \n\nOverall good experience.",

While it looked crowded from the outside, when we went in, we were seated immediately.  Our server greeted us and got our drinks right away, and took our order.  My friend and I had a hard time deciding between several delicious looking items, so we decided to split 2 meals. We ordered an omelet with spinach, onion and cheddar, which came with home fries, and an order of the 6-grain pancakes with bananas and walnuts.  \n\nWhile we waited for our order, our waitress delivered a basket of bread, which was awesome.  The cornbread was great, as was the home made strawberry jam.  Our food arrived in what felt like no time, despite how busy the restaurant seemed to be.  The potatoes seemed a little too well done to me, but everything else was excellent.  The eggs were a nice fluffy consistency, and had a good amount of the fillings.  The pancakes were AMAZING.  I absolutely loved them. \n\nWe left with full bellies.  As we left, I was very tempted to pick up one of the fresh cookies or other baked goods being sold at the register, but my full belly instructed me otherwise.  \n\nAfter a great experience, I would definitely like to come back to Le Bus.",

  "text": "La Villa is my favorite pizza place in the bucks county area! I grew up in Morrisville and this is the place to get pizza. Growing up we dined in and also ordered take out - all great experiences. \n\nI live in Orlando now and we just visited family and we ordered from there twice. Both times we ordered pizza, Stromboli and cheese fries. I LOVE their Stromboli and have never found another one that compares. What I love about La Villa Stromboli is they put the sauce into it. Any other place that I have ordered a Stromboli the sauce is on the side. \n\nTheir pizza also slaps, great Italian pizza. Their cheese fries are also great. I've never had anything here I haven't liked. So if you're in Morrisville and want pizza, stop at La Villa.",

  "text": "I'll admit, I was a bit apprehensive when saw Five Daughters Bakery's actual donuts. You see, I'm a simplistic person when it comes to donuts. Give me a standard glazed and a tall glass of whole milk and I'm golden. When I saw the vast spread of available donuts, flashes of the former cupcake craze Nashville entered my mind. You see FDB's donuts look over-indulgent and over-decadent. So did the cupcakes back then, where cupcakes where overloaded with a mountain of icing where it actually ruined the cupcake. I thought to myself, is this the same? Well simply put, it's not.\n\nFDB's donuts seem intimidating but they aren't. I opted for 3 donuts because I needed to be sure they were the real deal. I got the Pineapple Whip, King Kong, and Cuban Cold Brew.\n\nOut of the 3, Pineapple Whip was the most disappointing. You see when I get something that is fruit-flavored, I expect it to taste like that fruit. The Pineapple Whip had absolutely no pineapple flavor. I tasted only the vanilla. While it was still good as for as gourmet donuts go, it was the weakest one.\n\nThe King Kong ranked #2 for me. It's basically the same thing as the Maple Glaze donut but with candied bacon pieces. The bacon added a salty, savory flavor and complemented the vanilla buttercream and maple glaze.\n\nLast but not least, the Cuban Cold Brew was my favorite. I think it was the sweetened condensed milk cream in the middle that did it for me. It was like a glazed coffee cake in steroids.\n\nIf you love donuts you'll love Five Daughters Bakery. If you love sweets to any degree, their donuts are a good substitute for actual dessert (I do the same thing with fresh Krispy Kreme). The donuts aren't a fad (I hope) and are legitimately delicious.",

(Warning: Do not order this to \"tie you over\" to a meal like we did, as my boyfriend and I ended up being too full to even eat lunch after this!)\n\nI love their fresh mango bubble milk (with soy milk substition), whereas my boyfriend loves the signature Dream bubble drink with made with coconut and taro.\n\nThe renovations are decent and were much needed after the sloppy disarray the store front was before.

I feel I get such a better deal with the nachos than with the puny looking tacos, so much so that I haven't even tried them. \nOne more gripe... getting a little extra guacamole will set you back about 6 bucks. apparently there is not a side order of guac, so they charge for a full order of guac and chips... I find that ridiculous.\nLive and learn. Everything else is awesome, so I just learn what to avoid here.",

Internet would be fast then slow, cannot get anything done about it. When asking them to match competitor prices you will get responses like I did, \" I don't believe that\",  \" I cant\". They wont even offer to talk to anyone about it. They do not honor any employer discounts. WOW's way or the highway is how they do business. If you are not into negotiating, like buying a car and paying full sticker price then you will love WOW but still wont love their service. 2 other people went when I wen to cancel their services, I was there for less than 10 minutes. I got no questions asked, no sorrys, no let me see what we can do's, not even a what happened. I was with them for 3 days and told them that! I said im here to cancel services I've only been with you 3 days, lady at counter said \"ok\". 2 minutes later heres your print out. You can tell people cancel them all day long by their demeanor and responses, how are they still in business. I would sooner switch back to Broighthouse which is like a 100% guarantee I'm shooting myself in the foot than go back to WOW. Pick the lesser of evils and choose someone else.",

When I come here, it is usually with a small group, and we tend to order drinks and pizzas to share.  Any of the pizzas are delicious.  They are a nice thin crust with the perfect ratio of toppings, sauce and crust.\n\nThe pizzas are not huge, but if you are here with a few people, its the perfect place to get a few pies and share.  My favorites are: Spinach and Ricotta, Al Pastor, Wild Mushroom, and Eggplant.  Plus you can't go wrong with the classic Margherita Pizza.\n\nThey have lots of beer options, and the staff is super knowledgeable about what they have so if you need a suggestion, ask your server. \n\nStaff is friendly, and I love the low key, vibe in this restaurant.  Can get a little loud, but that is the nature if this kind of place.  I definitely recommend coming here if you are in the mood for some good cider or beer and delicious pizza!",

It took FOREVER to get out order to her because she kept stopping and doing something in the background. Once we reached the window we noticed she had on a mask but it was below her nose and no gloves. She gave us our drinks and asked us to pull forward. A few minutes later a lady brings out a bag and tells us to have a good day. We were missing the flounder sandwich my husband wanted to try, sauce for the shrimp he ordered and received 3 beignets instead of the 6 ordered. My husband puts his mask on and grabs the receipt. He was back out in minutes being told the order wasn't done so they were going to bring it out....but, the lady who brought it out said have a nice night?! Ok no big deal, we get on the road and I check the bag they gave him, no flounder sandwich but instead two plain chicken sandwiches. I took the bag of beignets out and there was a hole in the bag and powdered sugar went everywhere! All in all like I said the food we did get was decent but I wouldn't visit this location again anytime soon. I imagine we got someone's plain chicken sandwiches and they got his fish so that'll be interesting.",

Friendly staff made for a good start but the lack of air conditioning made for a stifling and uncomfortable meal.  There were a variety of dishes to choose from.  I had the tres gulpes and was underwhelmed.  The fried cheese and salami were good but the base of the meal was mushy and not flavorful.  My friend had the Tilapia which came out black.  I did;t ask her how it tasted but it looked severely If I were to go back again I would order the chicken lunch special - half a chicken with rice and beans for $7.50.  Also getting it to go would prevent from having to eat in an un-airconditioned room.  This place has potential unfortunately I didn't feel like it was quite met.",

There are plenty of tables inside and a couple benches outside if you want to eat here.  \n\nAs far as the food goes, I am seriously addicted to their acai bowls.  I think I probably stop in once a week for a bowl.  I loved all three of their bowl options.  I usually gravitate towards the Whatever bowl which has light and fruity base, although sometimes I will get the cacao bowl which has a hint of chocolate in the base.  They have a lot of different toppings which are all are spot on - fruit is fresh, granola is crunchy and the honey is local!      \n\nI will also come in here for some gelato or a pop.  My favorite pop is the earl grey lavender lemonade.  So yummy!  Whatever pops is a great place a sweet treat or a light breakfast/lunch acai bowl!",

So, yea, it's good! It looks unassuming from the outside, but man do you get delicious drinks and mouth watering plates here\n\nI can't live without the prime rib.

The risotto is rich, nicely seasoned and just begs you to eat more and more. And, when risotto asks nicely, who am I to argue?\n\nOk, so minor note, on my last visit, the prime rib wasn't fantastic. It was cooked to perfection, but the cut was just not as tender and succulent as it normally is. We came close to closing, so I think maybe this was just the one they had left? Or, more to say, I hope this is the case.  \n\nAsk about the drink specials. They change, and you might find some random deliciousness.

  "text": "I got a chance to kick off last Remembrance \"long\" weekend with a late night dinner at the new North 53. I say new, because although I had been there a few times before, this past Friday was their official reopening launch, showcasing a new look, new chef, and new dishes.\n\nThe tasting menu and plates are now gone and instead replaced with snacks, plates, and plates to share. The new concept focuses on smaller tapas style plates, encouraging its patrons to share more menu items. The most noticeable difference on the menu? The price. Diners, I'm sure, will be happy at the lower price point of the meal. \n\nI really enjoyed the mousse, the chicken liver sourced from Four Whistle Farm. Blended with duck fat, it was smooth and rich. Delicious! Could have used a couple more bites, perhaps larger individual portions would have been more satisfying, although the petite bites gain points for being adorable.\n\nChicharron seems like a trend now on a lot of menus and North 53 has jumped aboard. Scallops and mussels are dried in house and ground, with kelp and salmon katsubushi, giving a strong umami flavour to the fried pork skins. So good, crunchy, and super addicting!\n\nThe Marinated and Griddled Mushrooms came out next, a drool-inducing looking plate. A mixture of crimini, shitake, beech, and oyster mushrooms are first brined with Maggi sauce and griddled on the flat top before serving. \n\nThe Popcorn Chicken literally took on its name: pureed popcorn grits mixed in with a tempura beer batter made a crisp coating to bites of Four Whistle Farms chicken and finished with powdered popcorn. Yum!\n\nThe Shrimp Chorizo was one of my favourite dishes for the night! The shrimp was mixed in with a blend of garlic, chill, fennel seeds, smoked paprika and hot paprika, giving the \"sausage\" slices that classic chorizo flavour. Loved the fact that not all the shrimp was ground so that you could still taste and see chunks of shrimp. \n\nThe Carrot Salad was the most elegantly plated of the night, and was nice and refreshing after the heavier dishes we had earlier. Loved the colours and the varieties of techniques used to treat the carrots (steeped and pickled), with a light vinaigrette of olive oil and Saskatoon berry vinegar. To add back some sweetness, a carrot caramel, made from freshly juiced carrots, was drizzled around the plate. Quenelles of goat cheese topped it all off, with hints of green cardamom. Most of the bites I got were on the sweeter side, while some of the others got a hit of the vinaigrette. Wish I had the dish all to myself to get the best of both worlds!\n\nThe Rutabega & Oxtail Tart was a table favourite. John Schneider's Gold Forest Grains lends his Park wheat flour to make the tart shell, which was filled with a rutabaga puree. The oxtail was from Sangudo Farms, braised and shredded, then cooked with red wine, espolet peppers, and a red wine vinegar sourced from Spain. A micro salad from their urban cultivator topped off the dish with a honey and lemon oil.\n\nThe clam and scallop fettuccine gave the Shrimp Chorizo a run for its money for me. Utilizing their pasta extruder, the house made egg-free (whaa?) pasta was amazing and perfectly cooked. West Coast clams and Nova Scotia scallops were tossed in alongside a white wine sauce, my favourite! Absolutely loved this dish and bound to be a favourite for many.\n\nLast main for the night was the Short Rib Glazed in Beer. The short rib was sous vide for 24 hours before being finished with a beef stock and beer glaze. The navy beans were nice and tender, but not overcooked, and mixed with parsnips, carrots, onions, and celery. I was confused as to where the bone marrow was, expecting a whole bone to be plated, but was notified that the dish was finished with raw bone marrow for added flavour.\n\nThe Blue d'Elizabeth was a conversation stopper, a combination of the named blue cheese from Quebec, roasted Bosc pear, and a side of salad with olive oil from Turkey and dressed with a burnt caramel mixture, deglazed with a sweet sherry. The components were all separate but combined created an amazing dish, well balanced, and truly unique. I'm not the biggest fan of blue cheese either but this was so yummy!\n\nThe Cognac ice cream. TO DIE FOR. Smooth, creamy, the ice cream's texture was perfect. Calvados and maple syrup were incorporated into the mix itself, and finished with Cognac-rehydrated sultana raisins. Even the simple toasted brown flour sugar cookies were delicious! We also got to try the blueberry sorbet (unpictured), light and refreshing, not overly sweet. A great way to end our meal.\n\nFried chicken is only available as the  perfect late night snack: three pieces of dark meat, brined and fried with a simple batter. A powdered green Tabasco and jalapeño mixture gave the chicken an added kick, although I didn't seem to get any of that in my bites! Will have to try it again on my next visit for that, but the chicken was moist and tender, the batter crispy.",

  "text": "Tacconelli's is hands down the BEST pie you can get in America - I might be willing to fight over this fact.  I lived in Italy for a year of my life so I have some footing to stand on here.  You might be puzzled by the 4 star review so let me elaborate...\n\nFirst off, planning a pizza dinner a few days in advanced seems a little obnoxious.\nThe wait was long and the restaurant was small we decided to wait outside no big deal, only problem was that all of the smokers would come outside and light up (downwind).  I think I second hand smoked a pack of ciggs before dinner. Not so nice aperitif.\n\nThe decor hasn't been changed since forever, but I like that!  Our waitress was a little short with us, I understand she was busy, but no need to be kinda rude to your customers.\n\nIt's a BYOB and we knew this in advance however, we did not know that we needed to also BYOG (Glasses).  Red wine isn't quite the same out of a plastic cup ha ha.\n\nNow to the pizza... My God, THE PIZZA... Thin crust, nice and crisp on the bottom  Pillowy and soft interior just above that.  Slightly smoky flavor throughout the dough, sauce and cheese.  The red sauce is like sun dried tomatoes had an illegitimate child with fire roasted tomatoes.  The flavors are so concentrated and complex, be sure to sip wine with the meal as most of the flavors in tomatoes are alcohol soluble. In plain English... you wont be able to truly taste the sauce unless there is a little alcohol present to allow your plate to experience them. (Sorry I know weird food stuff, but trust me here, you want the full effect!)  Cheese was sparse on the pie.. the way it should be, because it's about the sauce!  However the cheese was of amazing quality, no grease here.  \n\n14 bones for a medium sized pizza seems a bit high but, as we have already established, the place was packed, you need to reserve your dough, wait outside before you are even seated, and it is the best pizza you can get without a passport so I guess I should be happy they aren't charging $40 (because I knew a few pizza junkies that would still pay that)\n\nAll of that being said... it's an AMAZING pizza experience.  Order your dough, wait outside, bring wine and a couple of glasses, ignore the unhappy waitress, and order yourself a pizza like none other.  I would love to go 5 stars... I just can't do it with all of it's flaws.  \n-This pizza should be on your bucket list.",

  "text": "You'd think I was on a quest to find the best deli in STL--- maybe I am! \nAnywho, darling honey and I decided to eat for lunch a couple weeks ago after I suggested we try it out. \nWe had a coupon from the entertainment book-which helps.\nThe place wasnt crowded- in fact, we were the only people in there untill another table showed up-\nI will say, dont blink! or you'll miss it! \nSuch a cute, quaint little place. So for that, it gets a star.\nI LOVE delis--- and I am certainly not a picky one, at all---\nBut I must say, I was a tad disappointed in my sandwich, and the lack of flavor.\nI ordered the For Petes Sake- which on the board, sounded amazing! \nIn my mouth---- not so much. While it was okay, it just didnt blow me away. \nWith flavors like bacon, applesauce, brie, caramelized onions, and applewood smoked pork loin you'd think that it would be bursting with flavor---it wasnt.\nIt really had no taste.\nNow, darling honey ordered the hangover club, and he seemed to really enjoy it.\nHowever he said he would get it without the spicy mustard next time.\nI will definitely return to Noras for a chance for redemption- but I'm hoping next time \nmy sandwich is more of a party in my mouth, and not a dud.",

  "text": "My husband and I took advantage of the lovely cool weather last weekend and took the ferry from St. Pete to Tampa. What a fun, stress-free ride! It beats driving over the Howard Frankland any day. \n\nWe were meeting some friends at Sparkman Wharf so this was the perfect time to try out the ferry, since it drops off at the aquarium just around the corner. We parked in my husband's space downtown, but they do validate parking in the Sun Dial garage which is nice. The ship was easy enough to find right in front of the Vinoy. \n\nWe bought our tickets ($8/each way plus .80 convenience charge added to the entire order) on the mobile app the day before and are glad we did. When we bought them, it said there were 88 seats left on the boat, so when we got in line to board we were surprised to hear them say it was sold out! It was also sold out for our 3:15 trip back to St. Pete. \n\nThe boarding process was quick and easy and we got some nice seats outside. It was windy but not too windy to be out there. There was a snack bar serving beer/wine/mimosas but I wasn't able to see the prices. \n\nMy only complaint is that I wish 1) it wasn't ending in April and 2) they had more frequent times available. I'm meeting a friend for happy hour in Sparkman Wharf in a few weeks and don't want to wait until 10:45 to come home. It would also be nice to have a round trip discount - even if just a dollar or two. \n\nHowever, it's a great way to get to Tampa without driving and a cheap way to be out on the water. We will be utilizing the ferry to get to the next Lightning game we are attending in March!",

  "text": "Got a chance to check out Church and Union last week. Love the decor and vibe of the spot--similar to a speakeasy. The service was great and our server was very helpful in helping us navigate the menu. The food was great, but my filet was a little bit tough. Great flavor, though! The corn and carrots were wonderful as well. After dinner we bellied up to the bar for a drink and was happy they had some TVs showing the college football games that day. I have two things that prevented this from being a 5 star review: 1) there was no sign we could see, so we weren't entirely sure we were in the right place. 2) there is no valet and if you know downtown Nashville traffic, that automatically increases stress and anxiety! All in all, great experience.",

It's warm, friendly and a great little place to hide away for an afternoon. I attended a book discussion here one summer afternoon and enjoyed looking at the large children's selection that was available. They accept donations and have all sorts of genres. The gently used books were reasonably priced. \n\nI'll definitely return to look around more and to enjoy being in the presence of other folks who still enjoy books in print like myself.",

I got a 8\" single round birthday cake-chocolate chip pound cake was the flavor because that was one of the gluten free options they had! \n\nThe cake was BEAUTIFUL! I was blown away when I saw it. And it was only $25! It was beautifully decorated and DELICIOUS!!!! \n\nAlso, I tried their pumpkin spice cupcake, chocolate chip cookie, and mini red velvet cupcake. Everything was amazing. The pumpkin spice cupcake was basically a spice cake cupcake with this amazing spiced cream cheese frosting. I'm not sure exactly what was in it but was not your ordinary plain cream cheese frosting. I loved all of them. \n\nPLUS- they had samples at the bakery when I visited! They had their nut bar (so good) and their crumb cake (I took 2 samples because it was so good). I will definitely be going back!",

  "text": "Finally had a chance to try this place after walking by for a year. \nSince I came on sat at noon I wasn't surprised to see a line at the door. It was about a 35 min wait but considering how small the place is, they are able to squeeze in a fair amount of people. There is also an outdoor space in the back that appeared covered so that's promising.\nThe service was decent here but very busy so it was hard to get the waiters attention.\nNow onto food.\nFirst of all, their coffee and beverages were lovely. My friend got the aussie iced coffee which had espresso,vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. This was divine. I ordered a classic cappuccino which was perfect.\nFor our entrees I got the brie scramble which was yummy but I would prefer the chili sauce on the side for future reference - it's very sweet. The brie was delicious though. Also my friend and I were obsessed with the chip fries.\nMy friend ordered their daily special which was the maple bacon walnut French toast. He loved everything about it but didnt like how the walnuts were salty. Probably too much of a contrast for his preference. Overall a cozy spot that I would come back just to get some aussie drinks!",

The place is small, and holds about 3-4 tables.\n\nAs soon as my friend and I walked in, we were greeted warmly by the lady behind the counter, who waited patiently as we went over the menu selections. I was starving, and couldn't wait to try the Thanksgiving sandwich (Turkey, brie, cranberries, red peppers, lettuce, etc.). \n\nIt arrived on a gorgeous pretzel bun (perfectly crisp/chewy exterior, with a soft tender mouthfeel on the inside) and LOOKED incredibly fresh; I knew it was going to be a delicious sandwich. \n\nThe ingredients were vibrant, fresh, and clean-tasting. The simplicity of the ingredients made it all the better. Served alongside potato salad that contained fresh dill, apples and pickles, it was an ultra-satisfying, yet light and clean-tasting meal.\n\nFor dessert, I ordered a selection of pastries to share with friends at a picnic. I wasn't impressed with their layered cakes (we tried banana and chocolate) but their puff pastry shells filled with vanilla custard and topped with blackberries were delectable! Go for the cream-filled pastries for sure!\n\nThe prices here were reasonable at about $6-10 per lunch (small sandwich and potato salad) and the service was extremely warm and friendly. I loved Swiss 2 GO and can't wait to go back for a sandwich and salad!",

The greens were fresh and an assortment of arugula and other dark greens. It also had a generous amount of sliced avocado. The other offers are very authentic Island cuisine such as Oxtail soup, Jerk chicken and some American twists like Jerk Chicken Quesadilla and Jerk wings. The take away from this small, quaint restaurant is it is a friendly, casual place with really cool people that work there. While I was there the server and order taker as well as the cooks were definitely from the Islands and super friendly. You will feel very welcomed and they are happy to have you in their restaurant!! I love and appreciate this gratitude and hospitality in any place I spend my money!! Go and check it out order a few dishes to get a taste of Jamaica have some extra time because they do run on Island time and Cheers! Bonus - really cool Regge was playing!",

  "text": "We had just finished up at The Wilson County Bank in Gladeville having pictures with Santa along with all the cousins. I have an idea! Let's go to Providence in Mount Juliet and eat burgers! Yeah, let's just hop on over there and have dinner real quick...\n\nIt is about 5-ish, so we head that way from the Gladeville community. We zip along on Stewarts Ferry Pike to South Mount Juliet Road. Cool! But THEN we hit rush hour traffic along a lonely two lane highway - well not THAT lonely as traffic was backed up almost from Stewarts Ferry Pike to Central Pike. I'll wait until you pull up Google Earth before typing any more...\n\nDone yet? It's a long way isn't it? It takes about thirty minutes until we crest the hill after Central Pike and see the lights of civilization. We get to the restaurant around 5:45 - again - ish. I put in our name, give my phone number and await the anticipated text message which I was told would be 20 minutes. They appear short on servers at this burger place as several tables become vacant. Eventually others are sat - people that appear to have come in after us. I approach the host - \"I'm sorry, I entered your phone number wrong - we have been trying to get in touch!\" Someone in the 615 area code just asked his wife, \"Did you order a table? It's ready!\"\n\nThis turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Our daughter notices the man behind the bar as someone she knows - one of the managers. She knows his wife and knows that just yesterday he was suffering from an extreme stomach bug.  So I'm trying to get us a decent table and my wife says, \"We are leaving!\" Wait? What?! I'm about to score us some free food!\" We get outside and they explain why we are leaving. \n\nWhat now? Mexican, Chinese? Me, \"What about Cori's Dog House?\" Silence. Again, \"What about Cori's\" No response. \"I said what about....\" \"We heard you - just hoping you would get the hint.\"  Someone mentions Indian. \"Cori's has an Indiana Hot Dog!\" My lip stopped bleeding in a few minutes, good luck getting that blood stain off her coat sleeve, though. \n\nThis was our first visit as well as our daughter to Persis Biryani Indian Grill - you probably forgot by now which restaurant I was reviewing. My son-in-law had been along with our one year old grandson about two years ago - just seeing if you were paying attention. Were it not for the food and obvious ethnicity of the staff, you would not know you were in an Indian restaurant. The inside is sleek and modern with lots of stone, modern chairs and white laminate - bright, but pleasing. We were sat immediately. Indian food has flavors that appeal to a certain palette. Or if you are like my wife you had some really bad Indian food a few decades ago and never gave it another shot.\n\nThis time she goes WAY out on a limb and orders the Saag - just kidding - she gets this every time - she also locks her car when it is in the garage - so go ahead and analyze her. They have butter chicken AND chicken tiki masala which I had thought were the same, but were different here. Here they use ghee instead of just run of the mill butter. It imparts a nutty flavor - slick, huh? I read it on their wall. Our daughter orders the butter chicken - now it is her favorite to date - and Indian food is now her favorite. If you follow my reviews - and who doesn't - you know that she or my wife thought they wouldn't like it. There is the aforementioned reason in regards my wife and then there is her negative influence on her daughter all these many years. I am surprised DHS didn't pull her from our home, but she is almost 30. Daughter's husband orders the avocado curry, medium spice. He loved it! Now me - I tried to explore and decided to order the restaurant namesake dish - biryani. I get it with chicken and find that they don't have degrees of heat when preparing this dish. A slight language barrier with the server and he was finally able to explain that to me - I was asking what spice level - he was saying no spice eleven. He assured me it was spicy. It comes with riata yogurt and pepper gravy on the side. It is a large portion of basmati rice and lightly breaded chicken.  Good, but I would probably not order it again. I find I prefer the dishes that are sauce heavy. Good, but different. We ordered garlic and bullet naan. Bullet naan is very spicy! The garlic was delicious as well. Our daughter loved dipping the garlic naan in the sauce of her butter chicken. I did too, until my wife told me to leave her (our daughter) some...\n\nKid's meal is basically boneless tandoori chicken served with either white of fried rice or noodles. Lots of green onion so you might tell them to lighten up on that - otherwise the one year old ordered that - spicy level 3 - kidding. We said we might get the kid's meal next time. Our daughter had to tell her husband to leave him (their son) some...you women! It was that good. They leave a carafe of water at your table which is good and our server was great, but MORE WATER!",

  "text": "I know a couple local magazines have been calling Reeds American Table best restaurant of 2015 and I've been itching to try it out. I went to Reeds with two coworkers using a Seat Me reservation. We went on a Wednesday night and the place was packed! We had to wait about 5-10 but they quickly got us a table ready upstairs. \n\nThe main floor is pretty packed. They don't do the communal table thing, thank god, but you might be dining close to other guests. The upstairs is AMAZING. It feels like you're dining in a fancy living room. It's a tasteful space that sets the mood for any occasion. \n\nFor starters, we shared the breaded cauliflower, fried green beans, and Barbacoa. For my main meal I had their cheeseburger. Don't judge me, I love fancy burgers. The fried green beans and cauliflower were my favorite out of the starters. My main meal was amazing. The meat was juicy/tender and it was served on a nice fresh bun. The fries were served with a decadent aioli that calmed my inner fat kid. \n\nAnd don't worry, they serve craft cocktails. Right now they have a hot toddy drink served with honey and ginger. It's sooooo goood. I hope to recreate it at home soon with some Marker's Mark bourbon. If you're looking for something else, you'll find it. Their drink menu is expansive to say the least. Seriously, it's massive. \n\nThe staff was extremely friendly. There was a bit of delay getting our drinks out because the bar was so backed up but that was the only bump in the entire experience. Reeds is already my new place to impress friends looking for a quality meal.",

We drove in and as expected the lines were long but, were moving. We checked the menu on the side of the building and I decided on the \"Cardinal Sin\" concrete. Chocolate and cherries. My wife loves a \"Hot Fudge Sundae\". So we walked over to the walk up window and ordered. Within a minute we had a delicious treats and we were on our way. We are only visitors and it is too bad we don't have one of these locations where we live. I would visit a couple of times a week. If you are visiting the city make sure you try one of their 3 locations.",

We were one of two tables there. \n\nFood was good and the general usual for Ethiopian cuisine. We ordered the vegatarian combo and Special Kitfo.  We also ordered the peanut soup.\n\nWe found the peanut soup was  too sweet and I didn't finish mine. The rest of the food was really good though. I especially loved the Yesimir wot which is spicy red lentils. My husband loved the special kitfo. \n\nIt  was great, but I am not sure based on price whether it was either it was better of worse than the other Ethiopian places we went.\n\nOh and give the spiced tea a try. Although it came almost after half our meal was done.",

I really appreciated that they asked for our vaccination card as soon as we stated we wanted to eat here.  They sat us a table in the courtyard which was quiet and peaceful.  The service was fast which we appreciated being so hungry.  I loved the selection of wines and we ordered one from France to share and it was delicious.   We started with the baked brie with roasted garlic cream sauce & coulis & balsamic reduction and it was delicious.  We could have used a bit more bread though so some of our brie did go uneaten but that's ok.  My sister ordered the Mushroom De Vin with chicken, I got the angus medallions and my friend ordered the Boudin Sausage link.  It was all tasty but I think the angus medallions were a favorite.  The courtyard here is such a nice of breath of fresh air near the wilds of Bourbon St. and with little places to find good wine, this is a must-go to spot!",

I don't love being coddled and followed around in stores, but I would like a little bit of service. \n\nI think it's a by-product of being in WEM, but I also find their stock really picked over.

It is the smallest and the junkiest BUT this store has a great bread selection, if you can get in early!  I love Spoleti bread and when you get it for $1, that's a steal!  The staff are friendly enough but very laid back, hence the clutter.  Since this is the smallest of all the stores, there isn't much selection and there is no freezer/cold food section.  I don't spend much time browsing here, just come for the bread!  I only hit this store once every two weeks so I often miss my chance for Spoleti.

I mean pre-packaged sushi is never as good as the freshly prepared stuff.   In any event, I got suckered in (again) to getting a sushi roll (see pic).

  "text": "So, my friends are wanting to go to Peru, so I brought my travel photos and asked them to meet me at Azucar. Now inside is interesting, big dance floor, odd decorations and lights, and booths set out. I will have a disclaimer....if you want Columbian or Peruvian food eat here. For tacos or any other Latin American food...you probably would do just as well as somewhere else. This night we only ordered Peruvian food. We ordered Ceviche - which I loved but everyone else was squeamish  for.  It was fresh fish that is marinated in peppers and that is how it is cooked. Not great if you don't like raw fish..but this is exactly how I remembered it in Peru. I don't think anyone else does this in the city.   We also had Papa A La Huancaina -Steamed potatoes served with huancaina sauce (feta cheese, garlic, spices, and a hint of aji amarillo), garnished with boiled egg and black olives). This, everyone loved, and I suggest if you are new to Peruvian food give this one a try. We also tried  Azucar Jalea which was assortment of fried seafood which everyone seemed to enjoy as well. Another surprising win was the antichuchos - marinated beef heart.  I love this dish,and actually everyone also hesitantly enjoyed it too. Our server was attentive and lovely.  If you want to try some authentic Peruvian food try this!",

They have a pretty large drink and food selection which makes them the logical choice for my work breaks (I work overnight and I am mostly limited to gas stations and McDonald's). \n\nThe inside of Thortons is rather large and they have a wide variety of snacks. I have adopted an addiction to the Herr's Jalapeno Popper cheese doodles that I find here. Their wraps, salads and sandwiches are decent. While they are not the best thing to eat for lunch, I like them better than the other 2 gas station choices. I love that they have a large tea and soda selection and that they have syrups you can add to them. They even have soft serve and Shushies!",

  "text": "My first review of Bailey's Range was 3 stars and last night's experience was definitely worse so I'll go with 2 stars on this.  When 1. we're seated by an emo hostess who ignored my first query about where to find the loo, when 2. it takes 45 min to be served dinner, when 3. the compensation for the wait is a plate of stale fries after we've already ordered onion rings, when 4. the bill includes an extra drink charge, and when 5. the manager has to apologize for a 15 min delay for paying the bill because their bank has a limit on the number of credit card transactions/day, I draw the conclusion that I don't want to visit again.\nSure, I love the hipster decor and vibe but I wouldn't ever pay for that experience again.\nAll that aside, if you still decide to go, here's a rundown of what we ate:\n1. smoked onion rings -- good with a more tempura fry, not salty enough for my taste but a nice, new take on an old item\n2. small salted caramel shake with choc sauce -- VERY good though the small was PRETTY small and, therefore imho, overpriced\n3. PB&J on gluten-free bun ordered medium -- the bison burger was cooked nicely medium, the goat cheese and jam toppings were sparse, and the bun was decent but pretty bulky and difficult to fit in my mouth\n4. Dave's Smoked Burger on gluten-free bun -- again, decent but the burger was too small for the bun\n5. small peanut butter ice cream shake -- again, PRETTY small though tasty although I wish the peanut butter had been blended in better and wasn't left in chunks\n6. comped fries -- I had these on my first visit and found them stale; they were stale this second time around, as well",

  "text": "So I'm giving this place 3 stars because while it's so much fun, the service is really lacking. \n\nI've been twice now and both times were so much fun, until the last one wasn't. First off, the cover is high and fluctuates $15? $20? depends on the night. I get it, this is one of the only legit after hours spots, but it's still Philly. The drinks are also kind of high in price. \n\nI love that there are 3 floors with different music- depending on your mood you can choose a room and still have fun. \n\nNow the trouble. The last time I was there, it was Friday and not crazy busy, but a decent sized crowd. I had a bit to drink, but I wasn't very drunk. I could still walk, function and all just fine. My friends and I went down to the bottom floor to use the bathroom and while going down, one of the bouncers took my arm and escorted me out. I didn't understand what was going on until we got outside and he said I had to leave. What?! He said I was stumbling on the stairs and too drunk to stay. Like dude, I have on 4 inch heels, your stairs are uneven, it's dark and I'm not 100% sober, of course I'm going to teeter. But, he didn't care. I told him my friends and my stuff were still inside and he told me to call them and tell them to meet me outside. Their signal in there isn't the greatest and my calls kept going to voicemail and my messages were waiting to send. It's winter, the middle of the night, and while there are people around- including a few bouncers- I'm still a young woman alone. I'm crying when my friends come out and a manager walks up asking what happened. I told him and he kindly apologized for the situation and told us we could go back in if we wanted. This is after I stood outside for about 20 minutes. Ugh. \n\nThis was a real turn off. I had a lot of fun the first time and the second before this whole ordeal, but I don't know if I'll be back.",

  "text": "Great little stop just off The Fairway in Jenkintown! A menu filled with an array of salads (both prepared i.e. chicken, tuna, egg, shrimp and veggie fresh), sammies, soups, burgers, quesadillas, melts, wraps and comfort food staples. There's something for those indulging as well as veg-heads and the calorie conscious alike. The menu is especially adorable as many of the items are named after local neighborhoods and towns. Very cute touch! \n\nI used to stop on for lunch with my mom all of the time when I frequented the area more often and the Boca Raton salad was my go-to. It's grilled romaine with a big portobello atop drizzled with the sweetest, thick balsamic glaze. I loved the warm and cold ingredients together! So good! \n\nMost recently I stopped in for the prepared foods for din. While it all looked enticing and prepared with care, I wound up choosing grilled salmon which came with creamy tangy honey mustard and a big 'ol hunk of baked mac n cheese for hubs. He loved both but raved about the mac which he said was sweet, contained many different cheeses and topped with buttery breadcrumbs! I got the broccoli salad and it was THE best I've ever had! And it's dairy-free!!\n\n Davida the sweet owner was behind the counter helping me decide what to take home and giving me all ingredients in each dish as my family is made up of a bunch of P.I.T.A. Eaters. (Pain in the A**). She also told me exactly how to cook each item I purchased. Great customer service!\n\nThey have a delightful bakery with schneken, cookies, cakes and fresh breads too! Grab and go items like cheese and crackers, crostini and hummus too. \n\nI say it's a really great lunch option when in the area and a perfect spot for delicious prepared foods for din in a pinch!",

Seriously, nothing gets me hungry like the thought of dinner (or lunch... or brunch...) at Tony's.\n\nI love to swing by during lunch and get the lunch buffet... you're in and out really fast, and the food does not disappoint. The buffet includes a signature chicken item, two homemade soups, a variety of pizza and pasta, as well as one specialty item each day (boneless hot wings, BBQ burgers, or toasted ravioli)... AND IT'S $8.99.\n\nDinner is a whole other story! If you're a steak lover, this is where you need to be. The steaks are always perfectly done and topped with a steak butter only the gods of steak themselves know how to create. I was at a business dinner at Tony's once and took a bite of the steak, saying afterwards, \"that was the best thing I've ever had in my mouth!\" I enjoyed the entire rest of my steak, that is after the sting of the accidental and embarrassing innuendo wore off. I swear, you can't take me anywhere.\n\nMy usual way to go is the Hannah's Combo. It comes with a 4 oz. cut of house tenderloin as well as the Chicken Anthony, which is grilled chicken topped with provel cheese and a fresh lemon cream sauce. I also always have to get the white chicken nachos... Tony's is famous for them. I learned how to make them at home, but it's not the same.\n\nAs I predicted, I'm now hungry and it's 11pm. Anyone up for Tony's lunch buffet tomorrow?",

Anyway, on with the review!\n\nI went to Lolita for the second time last weekend with my boyfriend to meet his parents.  This is the sort of event that normally sends me into a nervous fit, but I kept my cool most of the day because I was so freaking excited to eat here!  Whether you want to call it Mexican or neo Mexican or Mexican influenced American, I don't care.  The food is seriously yummy.  We split some guacamole and fundido for an appetizer.  I would have eaten the guac with a spoon, but I was trying to make a good impression.  They all loved the fundido.  We also got a pitcher of blood orange margarita.  Boyfriend had the waitress bring me a glass with sugar and poured me some before adding tequila.  He said it would go really well with my meal.  At first I though a virgin margarita was kind of silly, but he was right.  Delicious.  It was such a good compliment to the spiciness of my salmon.  Everybody loved their meals.  The bittersweet chocolate pecan bread pudding I had for dessert was astoundingly good.  The flourless chocolate cake Boyfriend got was irrationally dry (seriously, there's no flour, how is it dry?). \n\nI would eat hear all the time if I could afford it, but I can't afford it.  At all.

It was the perfect environment for us to catch up! My friend ordered the margarita and enjoyed it. We also ordered the fries and the poutine. I liked that the fries came with multiple dipping sauces. Neither of us have had poutine before -- and my husband loves to get poutine when we visit his family in Canada -- so we thought we would try it. While I don't think I would order it again, it was definitely tasty and a recommendation for people who do like poutine. The food comes from the Revery so it was all delicious. Bonus - you get complimentary popcorn. We will definitely be coming back with our husbands especially since the patio opened this past weekend!",

  "text": "La Patisserie is the the quintessential French bakery. The ambiance is so bright and lively it really highlights how beautiful the pastries and cakes are. It really makes you crave a hot cup of tea with other bourgeoisie.\n\nI was stopping in after lunch at Union Loafers with a friend and was already stuffed but couldn't pass up on the opportunity to get something for later. Since the thought of food was a little much, I decided to try something I wouldn't normally get that looks pretty. Great logic, I know. \n\nI went with something that i'm 90% sure they called a  \"Choquette\", although I didn't know that was an actual thing. Maybe it's a signature item of theirs? Not sure. Regardless, it was amazing. I'm more of a chocolate lover but this decadent creamy baked good was legit. It had raspberry cream on top, filled with a really light custard like substance inside, all wrapped in a golden baked bowl. \n\nIt was legit. I highly recommend checking this place out if you're a sweets lover or even looking for a gift for a special friend.",

  "text": "What I have always loved about Sushi Garden is their unique lunch buffet. Where else in town can you get all-you-can-eat teriyaki salmon, seaweed salad, tempura, and various maki rolls? When I am really hungry for salmon and seaweed salad, I load up here. I'm usually not too crazy about Asian buffets, but because of how busy Sushi Garden gets, the food revolves fast. Usually the salmon is not sitting in the heaters very long before I eat it. The restaurant is centrally located in a nice area of town with plenty of parking in back.  Be careful, there are busy times and you may experience a short wait. I do not come here for their regular menu items and sushi because there are better options in town.",

The shape of the pontoon, cannot and does not intrigue the dolphins the same way that the tug boat of the Little Toot can.  They love to jump, play and frolick in the waves, and this boat type doesn't get it as epic as the other boat.\n\nMy mom & I went out on their dolphin watching tour & I won the Dolphin Spotting Contest!

For the contest, I won my choice of any snack or beverage (they have pop, beer, chips, candy, lots of snacks) as my prize!\nThe real prize is being able to be out watching these majestic creatures on a boat in the sunshine with my momma! We LOVED Captain Jack & first mate (Florence?) The crew was awesome! Learned about the Dolphins, the area, history lessons, very educational and fun!\nThey play fun boat music in between teaching us factoids about the area, houses, people, lifestyle, water creatures, everything! Well worth every penny of the only Twenty Dollar 90 minute cruise! \nFun crew, great atmosphere, we passengers were singing along, and having a great time on this fun adventure!\n\nDefinitely glad we went!!\nGo for it!",

  "text": "I recommend trying this school if you're on a budget and have some extra time to spend getting your hair done. The school is easy to find, clean, modern, and comfortable. Caitlin Baird did my highlights and I love them! She listened to what I wanted and did a great job. The only complaint I have about this school is the way they do appointments on Saturdays. In fact, they don't take appointments on Saturdays. It's walk-in, first come/first serve. Saturday's are the only time some people have to get their hair done and it's very inconvenient to not be able to make an appointment since there's no guarantee of getting your hair done if you're a walk-in. The student's don't have to be there on Saturday, it's optional. So one Saturday they may have 10 students there, the next, only 2. The other 2 schools I've been to in the area take appointments on Saturday and that may be the only thing that makes me go to them instead in the future.",

Once you walk in the door you are greeted by the friendly staff who are quick and kind enough to give you a run down of what they have to offer in the world of bundt cakes.\n\nThey offer 8\" and 10\" cakes, tiered cakes, cute bundtlets, bundtlet towers, and bundtinis that look like cupcakes but they are mini bundt cakes. So cute! \n\nI think this place is going to do just fine here in the 805. The quality and freshness of the bundt cake is amazing! They had samples of the lemon, and let me just tell you it was amazing. I love lemon and this cake was perfectly moist, slightly sweet with that zing of lemon flavor, and the best part of all was the cream cheese frosting! I could actually eat the frosting because it wasn't overly sweet like they tend to be. \n\nI purchased three bundtlet cakes to share with my co-workers. The hard part was choosing the flavors, but I decided on lemon, chocolate turtle, and white chocolate raspberry. My co-workers were very surprised just as I was by how delicious these were, and like me they also agreed the cake and frosting were just right, and again not overly sweet. \n\nShout out to Hashani S. for recommending the white chocolate raspberry flavor! It was delicious.\n\nI will say the hard part about the cake was cutting it up into small slices since the cake was very moist and the frosting was creamy. Aside from that no complaints!\n\nI look forward to going back to try more of their flavors. Definitely check this place out!",

  "text": "I'd hardly heard of poke a few months ago... Now it's the hottest new thing. Lines were reasonable at this establishment, and service was friendly, although it was hard to hear over the glass barriers.\n\nThe essentials: rice or greens, protein, one of five sauces, and toppings. I have only had spicy sauce, which gives a good zing to the bowls. You can also mix your proteins; I love the salmon, but all of the proteins are high quality. One improvement would be to include a non-animal product in the protein section. Toppings include such things as Hawaiian sea salt (of course), cucumber, radish, tobiko, mango, and pineapple. Everyone also gets some micro greens and a tiny tropical flower--yum!\n\nPoke Bowl lets you choose a small or a large bowl, the variation of which lies in the amount of protein added (3 or 5 scoops). Unfortunately, both are served in the same sized plastic bowl (whether you're eating in or taking out), so it gets a bit cramped with the large. Otherwise, Poke Bowl is worth a trip to indulge in this delectable dish.",

  "text": "16 check ins and a Duchess/Duke rivalry with my hubby behooves me to review one of my favorite bars in town. I really enjoy coming here to get a warm smile and big greeting from owner and talented bartender, Dylan! \n\nSince \"Home Means Nevada\" to me, it's great to be surrounded by all things Nevada in this casual, yet eclectic decor with wood benches, Victorian loungers, and saloon style bar. I also enjoy the chandeliers and pic of honest Abe. \n\nSnack on some popcorn or grab a menu from nearby local establishments if you come with an appetite. Get a refreshing drink of cucumber water during your visit or for your DD's. Pick a board game or two, or request a sporting event on one of their tv's, or simply enjoy conversation in a semi intimate setting. \n\nMy favorite thing to do is challenge Dylan with my craving of the day, whether it's give me something with grapefruit or ginger or spank some basil or hit me up with something spicy! Dylan's creativity and imagination is endless and my tastebuds are never disappointed. \n\nI love that he offers a family friendly atmosphere 3-8pm, so if you're out and about with littles or teenagers, you can stop in for a quencher or a quick game. And in this summer heat, sometimes a quaint little break makes the day! \n\nI also love that Dylan gives back to the community through special events at 1864. It could be shining on awesome people in our city, like Debbie McCarthy and Leslie McCarroll, owners of Bliss Babe Magazine, who threw a blue and green party to help a friend in need. Or it could be a fundraiser helping little ones like Baby Grayson fight cancer. \n\nThis bar is ever evolving to keep up with being the best of the best in Reno! Come check it out and keep coming to enjoy all the great changes! And tell Dylan I sent you! :)",

  "text": "So I'll be honest. We got takeout from here primarily because it was one of the few places that were open on Thanksgiving. We actually tried to order from 2 other restaurants before hitting Thanksgiving jackpot with Sher-e! Much like any Thanksgiving meal we were quite stuffed by the time we were done and I definitely needed to nap off all those good eats. \n\nWe shared the mushroom chicken, chicken biriyani, mixed vegetables and some naan. It was all very securely packaged for takeout in a mix of white paper box (Plain basmati rice) and round plastic containers for the curries and biriyani. The naan was wrapped in paper and foil. \n\nI loved the seasonings and spices in each dish. We requested it mild spice and I felt they delivered just the right amount. It was still a little spicy but just a subtle little hint of it in each entree. The white rice was soft and fluffy and while the biriyani was good flavor wise, I thought the rice was just a tad overcooked. The naan itself was a little unevenly cooked as one piece was still a little doughy in the center but had black charred bits in the thinner parts of the bread. Seems like the oven it was cooked in was too hot perhaps? \n\nPortions were plentiful and it was enough to satisfy 2 adults and one toddler with leftovers to spare. If I were craving Indian food, whether on a holiday or not, I feel like Shere-e is a solid choice.",

  "text": "This is not your standard Americanized Chinese restaurant. Definitely not a orange chicken and beef broccoli kind of place. This is more like the kind of authentic Chinese food I grew up eating!\n\nI finally decided to try Chef Wang on a night that I was craving green onion pancakes and Taiwanese beef noodle soup. I live on the west side and Chef Wang's came up on Yelp when I searched \"green onion pancakes\" so after checking out the reviews my husband and I decided to give it a chance. We were not disappointed! \n\nI was immediately excited by the fact that they had Xiaolongbao! Soup dumplings are hard to come by in Tucson! I think on their menu they called it \"small steamed bun - 10 pc.\"  We got an order of those, the green onion pancakes I'd been craving, the spicy beef noodle soup, and the salt and pepper ribs, all family style. We also got a pitcher of beer. \n\nJust re-capping everything we ordered is making my mouth water all over again! Both the green onion pancakes and the spicy beef noodle were *exactly* what I was craving. So flavorful! When my husband and I bit into the ribs, all we could say for a good minute was, \"Wow!\" The ribs were perfectly salted. My husband couldn't stop raving about them! \n\nMy only \"complaints\" are that I wish they had given me a dipping sauce with my green onion pancakes, and that I wish there had been more bok choy in the spicy beef noodle. The latter is more of a personal problem though as I just love a lot of bok choy and typically need to order \"extra\" veggies anyways.\n\nService is standard for any good, non-American restaurant. It's similar to how some people say the hole-in-the-wall restaurants typically have the best food. In my experience the trade off is usually giving up an attentive server for the most amazing, authentic food. I'm 100% down for that trade-off and typically if I sit down and I realize service is that way, I have my strategy locked and loaded. I keep a mental list of everything I might need in the future and ask for it all at once. Napkins, sauces, extra drinks before we need them, and if there's something I think I'm forgetting a polite \"I think that was it but can you please come check back in 10 minutes?\" usually suffices! \n\nI think during our visit we were checked on a total of 4 ish times from start to finish, but I was too enamored by our delicious food to need anything but space anyways. Trust me when I say we will be back.",

Maybe could have been a little warmer.  The salad was a nice side salad fresh and amazing homemade ranch dressing I loved.  The fries are shoestring, but not too thin.  Overall, pretty good.  Prices seemed a little steep, but you also get a lot of food.  Will be back!",

  "text": "Love Willie Mae's and will never visit Nola without stopping in. Been to both locations and this one has more space so its my preference. The other location can be cold to the point where you have to eat with your coat on. Waiting outside in a long line at the othet location isn't ideal to me. The service was ok but the bathroom needs some attention. It was very stereotypical public bathroom. The food is the same at both locations. I had the fried chicken, red beans and rice, sweet tea and bread pudding with rum sauce. Ate here twice during my visit. Had butter beans and cornbread with my chicken the second go round. I wish you could pick your pieces but white or dark meat were the only options. I didn't mind so much but it would be nice to have options. The chicken is seasoned and fried to perfection. The bread pudding is outstanding but it took long for some reason. It was worth it and I will certainly go back. Check groupon because I got a great deal. Head they're putting one in the airport and I'm looking forward to that. I can bring some chicken home to savor the flavor.",

  "text": "My husband and I came here tonight not really knowing what to expect from the mixed reviews on Yelp.  We would be really happy to have a new dinner place close to our house, but it seems like most of the reviews on here are either love it or hate it, and not very much in between.  My experience was exactly in between.  It was not incredible, and they committed no egregious actions like hair in the food (though I did find some and freaked out until I realized it was a cat hair from my shirt).\n\nWe arrived, and there was a girl cleaning the windows on the doors.  She did not move or open the door for us.  She just stared at us, deadpan, through the window, as we walked in.  Maybe I have been playing too much Walking Dead, but I was reminded of a zombie.  Then she spoke and greeted us and my fears of an un-dead uprising were put to rest.\n\nWe were seated on a very wet bench.  I told my husband, Gabe, that my seat was wet, and the girl in the next booth apologized and made it clear she was cleaning the seats (no, no need to dry them.  My butt did the job just fine, thanks!)\n\nOur server came over and asked for our drink orders.  I had never been here and kind of wanted to try the best of what they had.  I asked for a recommendation.  I got a list of six different drinks.  If anything it made my decision even more difficult.  I get it, and I appreciate his gusto, but I was looking for more, like, one or two of his favorites.\n\nI got the Spiked Strawberry Lemonade and Gabe got the Texas Sweet Tea.  Both drinks are dangerous, in a good way!  They were super delicious and you couldn't taste the liquor.  If I didn't know there was liquor, I would easily have put down two or three quickly and then regret it later.  I must befriend the bar tender here and learn how to make the spiked lemonade.  Yummy yummy.\n\nGabe was excited over the cheese bite appetizer, and we got those.  I will say, I am not a big fan of fried cheese, be it mozzarella sticks, cheese curds or whatever other cheese you want to bread and fry, but these were pretty tasty!  The cheese tasted fresh, they were clearly freshly fried, yummy marinara sauce to go with them... for once in my life I was a fan of fried cheese!  Hooray!\n\nI ordered the Dijon Chicken with Mushrooms with broccoli cheese casserole and red beans and rice as my sides, and Gabe got the New Orleans Pasta.  Our food took a little while to come out, but we were in no rush and having a nice time so it didn't really bug us.\n\nThings get fun here.  Mine, on one hand, was just fine.  The red beans and rice were spectacular, the casserole was good and the chicken was cooked well with a tasty dijon sauce on top.  Gabe's pasta, however, was amazingly overdone.  I thought he was exaggerating, and I took a bite.  Yup.  Pasta mush.  The flavor profile was there, the meats were yummy, but the pasta, the main part of the dish, was so over cooked it was inedible.\n\nWe alerted our server, who was very nice and took it away to replace it.  I understand this is a new place and has kinks, and I was sure the pasta was just forgotten about in the water or something.  I was waiting to eat my dinner until he got his, and in the middle of his sentence, telling me to continue with mine so it doesn't get cold, his arrived.  Less than two minutes later.  I was convinced they had just stirred it and brought him the same plate, since the pasta in this one was just as overdone,\n\nWe alerted our server again, who got the manager.  Before she even spoke we knew she was pissed about having to deal with us.  She informed us this is just the way they make pasta, every restaurant does this, and this is what they do.  No apology, no admitting it was over done...and while there are a ton of places that practice this, I have had better cooked pasta at Applebee's.  Gabe showed her how he could, without moving the penne noodle at all, slice it open with his fork, and when he tried to scoop one up with his fork, it disintegrated.  After a little bit of back and forth, she offered to get him something else.  He got the lemon pepper chicken.\n\nThe chicken came out in the same amount of time as the second pasta dish.  Under two minutes.  So, this place MAY be made from scratch, but it is made from scratch and then tossed into a steam tray to sit for God knows how long until someone orders it.\n\nOur server came up to us, said he assumed we didn't want dessert (we did, actually, but his comment made us both feel like he just wanted us gone), and he brought us our check.  No offer for a to go dessert, no discount on Gabe's meal, which had to be sent back twice and then he ended up ordering something he didn't really want to begin with, nothing.\n\nCheddar's may be good some day.  And maybe some day I will try it again.  But for the forseeable future, I won't be back, and I certainly won't be recommending it to anyone.",

The first time trying them out I sat down and my waitress was very helpful with explaining what certain meals were to what wine to choose with them! I ordered the sweet and sour pork my first time and loved it. I couldn't wait to go back!\n\nYou must try the Drunken Noodles - hot. I don't know what heaven tastes like but I assume this is it. You can order it with chicken (my favorite), shrimp, or steak. They give you huge shrimp and a decent amount when you order it. We order from here weekly and they are very consistent. You get large portions for what you pay, they are always welcoming, very nice atmosphere. \nI would recommend this hidden treasure to any visiting Port Richey.",

I loved the clean, welcoming atmosphere and the delicious selection of beers.  If you have Sweetwater and New Belgium on tap, you're alright in my book.  Did you say 24oz Sweetwater IPA and Fat Tire for something like $3.25 a piece?  Oh, you did.  Good.  Perfect.\n\nTheir pretzels were obnoxiously delicious, because I think I ate my weight in them.  And then I dipped them in the Yazoo ale beer cheese and nearly died of happiness.  So good!\n\nThe bartender was awesome.  He introduced himself, smiled a lot, and was friendly to everyone (even to the girl who ordered O'Douls).\n\nEast Nashville is full of fun, little surprises - this being one of them! I will definitely take the trip back here to fill up on those delicious pretzels and cheese! Oh, and of course for the tasty brew.  Afterall, it is a beer garden.",

  "text": "Let me begin by saying we generally love Jimmy John's. We recently moved, and we used to frequent the Jimmy John's on Southport Road, which had great service (despite being inexplicably edged out of their delivery area), great food, and a friendly staff. This Jimmy John's? Not so much. Most of the workers don't care when you walk in the door and are far from friendly. The sandwiches are sub par, as well. The tuna has made me sick, and I've had my unwich served on browning, wilted lettuce before. It was gross. I much prefer the time their produce truck hadn't shown up and I couldn't get an unwich at all. Tell me that rather than give me rotting lettuce next time, thanks. Today was the icing on the cake. I ordered delivery for the first time---I was home with the kids, we ran out of lunch fixings, and it seemed like it would be fast. It took almost an HOUR for the sandwiches to arrive from the time the order was confirmed. That is neither freaky nor fast, considering I could have walked there and back in under an hour. I need to just stop going to this Jimmy John's and try to preserve some semblance of respect for the chain.",

I planned to pop into Mark Pi's next door for noodles but saw Blue Danube here...had assumed (for whatever reason) it was further south on Allisonville and thought I would give it a shot.\n\nI was greeted warmly by Tatiana (who is one of the co-owners and is Bulgarian) and I told her I had bookmarked Yelp some time ago and was here for something to eat!  She pointed out the sandwiches along with several savory items that had just come out of the oven...she gave me a sample of a very good savory pastry and told me a bit about it's origin.\n\nThe store has a wide variety of Eastern European fare, canned or otherwise.  Really a unique selection of goods.  Various noodles, vegetables, and a lot of stuff with labels I cannot read.\n\nFor lunch I decided to go with a Dracula sandwich (she sort of snickered at the name since it was her business partner's idea...who is Romanian..get it?) and it was a very tasty combo of Romanian salami, Italian bologna, and a spicy Hungarian ketchup served on a baguette.\n\nSandwiches are sold by the pound (I think it was $6.89#) so my kick ass sandwich was under $5.  Take that Subway!  I also had a warm apple rose which was a flaky and sweet miniature apple pie that was fresh from the oven.  Delicious.\n\nI loved the place so much that I walked out with a stick of European salami, a loaf of fresh bread, and a bottle of Bulgarian wine.  So $30 later is where I ended up all said and done.\n\nBut so worth it.  Great customer service and terrific ethnic food will bring me here again.",

PCS is an nfp and is interested ONLY in helping our community/environment/city/QOL. In contrast, Zip Car is primarily concerned with profit with those other goals second. I think Zip car has a place in Phila and other cities: in cities without an NFP service, Zip Car is better than nothing. In cities with an NFP that runs as well as PCS, Zip Car should be used an overflow option: when it is not possible for PCS to keep up with a peak in demand, then Zip Car should be there to step in and offer an alternative at a premium.\n\nThanks PCS.\n\nNote: if I could change one thing (and they may have added this in the last year) I would add the ability to use a PCS account and fob in other cities. I make it home to Emeryville 3-4 times a year and would love to use my PCS account on City Car Share.",

This offers our downtown visitors and locals so many options they have not had until this point.  Fresh and local food choices all in one place .. that don't require a reservation.. and that aren't tied to a honkey tonk! The options are so much healthier too for this part of town.  The space also has some very noteworthy out of town brands that fit in very nicely with the landscape they have created here.\nThey have made every effort to offer diverse offerings, while not sacrificing quality.  I love that there are two bars in the middle of the space... because.. you are in Nashville, after all. \nI opted for some Pad Thai from Thai Essane, a poke bowl for my daughter, 6 donut box from Donut Distillery and a pizza to go from DeSano's.  Nailed it.  \nThis will be a great stop before and after shows at the Ryman, Bridgestone, Schermerhorn.. you name it.  Never mind a spot to casually swing by and feed your needs.\nParking is paid.

They have only soft serve but lots of fun ways to eat it and a flavor of the day.  Today they had Trix, but I opted for something a bit safer. I got the Nutella milkshake. It did not disappoint. How could Nutella go wrong? It can't.  Fun and would go in again if I am in the area. Plus I was in love with the Golden Girls decor.",

  "text": "Lordy Mercy I do love me some Thunderbird!\n\nFeel like some good southern comfort food but... Well... Fancier? You need look no further than Fountain Square. This relatively new restaurant has brought the south right here to Indy. Grits, fried chicken, succotash, and greens... What more do you need?! \n\nBut in all seriousness... Let's talk about that pickle brined chicken. Hot damn. The BEST fried chicken I've ever had. No... I'm not just saying that. It's seriously like the most crunchiest, most tastiest, most did-a-pickle-just-sneak-into-my-mouth-with-my-fried chicken, most (dare I say the most hated word) MOIST chicken I've ever had. And if you're wondering, yeah, I did use double superlatives to describe how good this chicken is in your mouth. Deal with it. \n\nI could continue on my rampage of fried chicken love but I wanna talk drinks. EXCELLENT bar tenders who know their way around a shaker. Pleeeenty of local beer choices as well. \n\nBut, no trip to the Bird would be complete without beignets. Tasty little fried donuts and their crunchy outside and pillowy doughboy tummy insides. And dat apple butter... Mmmm. And for $4?! Hello bargain. As if I didn't need another reason to rationalize getting them every single time I go, they had to go and make it affordable. Now I'm definitely defenseless against them. Thanks ThundyBird. \n\nIn conclusion, T-bird is one of my favorite foodie joints and continues to please my inner southern belle.",

I couldn't resist the Benedict menu. I had florentine style, which happens to include 3 pieces of crispy bacon.  It was a little salty, probably from the bacon.

  "text": "This review is long overdue for work we had done in October. We needed a contractor to turn a large bedroom into 2 smaller bedrooms for our kids. We needed framing, sheetrock, electrical, trim and closets built. Joe was way more responsive than all other contractors and was very reasonable with costs. The price was exactly what he quoted us.  (Another contractor was supposed to start before we found Joe and completely ghosted us around the start date.) \n\nLou was the main guy who was here several days and he was great. We felt totally comfortable with him in our home. Our 4 year old son kept asking where Lou was after the project was completed. Lou worked around us when it came to hours that worked best for our family. Our kids love their bedrooms. And our 4 year old son finally sleeps in his own bed. We will be calling Joe when we are ready to remodel our kitchen and bathrooms.",

  "text": "This is where the University of Michigan and West Virginia University (along with others) alumni officially meet to watch games.  Therefore, on days that certain teams are playing, this place will be completely packed!\n\nI love this places nachos.  They are huge and fully loaded with everything you want on nachos.  Their wings are good also.  Honestly, all the food here is fine for bar food.  The real reason you come here is for the atmosphere.  \n\nUsually they have two college alumni groups here at the same time.  One is in half of the bar and the other is on the other side.  This makes sure that on weekends this place is packed to almost standing room only on college football (and basketball) weekends.  \n\nParking here can be difficult.  The Beef O' Brady's parking lot fills up really fast and you end up having to park on the street.  Sometimes the Salvation Army opens up its parking lot to patrons.  I'm always wary of parking on the street, because I don't want to be towed, but it seems pretty safe here.\n\nThis is a great place to grab a beer and relive your college days with people of all ages.",

It is literally exactly like a chipotle of Indian food. There are multiple options for how you want your dish. I opted for the rice bowl but my friend got the tacos. I like how with the tacos you can get 2 different proteins sauces etc and they did let me do that as well with the bowl, it just gets a little more mixed together in the bowl. The 1 complaint she had with the tacos is the naan bread was a little too hard to fold and hold together in a taco shape, maybe steam the bread a little first? I really loved what I got, chicken tikka and paneer however I would like to see more education on what all the items taste like (proteins and sauces). Though the worker explained it would still be nice to see something written out. The restaurant was nice inside however it did get very warm with the big windows and the sun shining in, we actually left quickly because it got uncomfortably hot. Add some shades and an educational menu and it will be top notch! I'll definitely be back!",

I'll be honest I've walked past this place many a time, it's was always bustling with activity and busy.  On this fine night, friends and I had a lovely dinner around the corner at Couvant (delicious and fancy).  The night was clearly not over, so instead of heading to the bar at the Eliza Jane(it was quite full with conference peeps) we meandered to the Little Bar.\nIt's a deep little bar and the bar was full of characters on this fine night.  We found ourselves setting up at a table on the side that seem to suite our needs quite well.  We enjoyed local beer and proper bar cocktails.  I'm not sure who chose the music but I could sing along to most all the songs.  A little ruckus happened at the bar and the bartender quickly ejected said varmint and the festivities continued without skipping a beat.  From the varied patrons attire, I assume this is definitely a local for service industry folk whom are ready to slug a few back after their shifts.\nI'll be back for sure and you should give it a go too.  We left a nice tip for the Bartender and I thought he might jump over the bar and give the Pirate a hug.\nYeah we'll be back for certain.",

My daughter usually gets the Cookie Master ( which is basically cookies and cream) with an Oreo and m&m's as her toppings. I've also had the Monkey Lover (vanilla ice cream with bananas chopped up in it) --- this is by far my favorite!  Once you order them you can go watch the ice cream chefs roll the ice cream. Really cool to watch!! And once it's done, the presentation in you bowl is just beautiful!  It's $5.95 for a good size portion. You get like 7 rolls in your bowl, along with 2 toppings of your choice. \n\nThey also have bubble tea and crepes. The bubble tea is served it cute light bulb looking cups that you can keep. Not a fan of the bubble tea however. Too sweet.",

  "text": "The first time that I sampled Malaysian food was at this restaurant, and now I am a fan of this cuisine for life! Rasa Sayang is a very conveniently located restaurant in Wilmington, and offers a fun and lively atmosphere to dine in. There is a happy hour offering discounts on select drinks at their in-house bar, as well as on some appetizer items. Speaking of appetizers, I highly recommend the roti canai, which is a warm and fluffy pancake-like appetizer served with a side of delicious chicken curry. After trying roti canai at other places and a failed attempt of making it at home, I have grown to really appreciate the skill required to make Rasa Sayang's amazing roti canai. It was so delicious that we promptly returned the following day to dine at this restaurant again! We also tried the roti telur, which was a bit more filling than the roti canai, however not as satisfying. Apart from the appetizers, they also had some notable main course dishes. We tried the noodle dishes (chay koay teow and mee goreng), which were very flavorful and came in extremely generous portions! This restaurant is a rare gem for asian food lovers, in a location that offers extremely limited selection of asian eats.",

I also usually get the Power Breakfast Sandwich, which is turkey sausage, a veggie egg omelet, and cheese all on a multigrain sandwich bread. It's filling and tasty!\n\nDid you know about their flavor shots? They're an essence that they put in your coffee that has zero sugar (or artificial sweetener) and tons of flavor. It's like if you were to order the hazelnut coffee at Bread Co, same concept. There are several flavors and my go-to in the winter is the vanilla and cinnamon since it reminds me of a holiday drink! Great option for people who like additional flavor but don't want the sugar rush from the syrups.\n\nOnto the staff. I've only ever had super positive interactions here. I typically interact with ladies when ordering and men when I get my food (this seems to be typical staffing trend at quick service places), but everyone is so friendly, warm, and kind. It's my favorite way to start my day when I go into the office since I WFH other days. I proudly call Tues and Thurs my 'Dunkin Days', they always start my day off sunny!!",

I ordered the chilaquiles.  They had an interesting take, doing theirs more casserole style.  I was disappointed when it came out because the dish looked so small.  However, it was really filling!  \n\nService was fine, nothing special.  To be fair, service was pretty good, but after going to their amazing downtown Indy location, I was not as impressed with service here.  I was pleased they did not try to stuff our party of five into a small table.  They gave us a roomy round table meant for six people.  \n\nMy one complaint was that I ordered my scrambled eggs well done.  They came out perfectly fluffy and yellow.  This is fine for a person who likes their eggs that way, but I like mine burnt and brown.  I'm not sure if our server didn't know what I meant by \"well done\" or if the kitchen didn't cook them the way she told them to, but it was disappointing.",

The Love is so homey and romantic I can't wait to go back.\n\nI made reservations on OpenTable for 6:30 for my birthday with my parents and hubby. We were seated right away and my table request was fulfilled as well. Our waiter was prompt and everything you would expect for a Steven Starr Resteraunt. The space is fairly small. I believe I read there are only one hundred seats available including the bar area. But the space definitely works. Although small it feels very open. The Love is filled with booths, half booths, and whicker chairs.\n\nLet's talk cocktails: \nThey had roughly nine cocktails on the menu and I probably could have drank any of them. I went with the Broken Arrow. A tequila drink w/ pear purée and agave. It was really great. Almost refreshing in a way that margaritas can lack. My husband went with 'A Very Good Bourbon Drink' he enjoyed as well. Definitely would like to try the 'A Mule With No Name' next visit. \n\nFor starters our table shared the mushroom toast and the farm salad. The mushroom toast was delish, but the real winner was the salad. Also was not expecting the salad to be as big as it was.. definitely shareable if you're not making it your entree! - I will say the only thing that jumped out to me on the \"A Real Meal\" list was the Provençal Scallops. Other entrees ordered were the Maple Salmon and the Lovebird. My husband LOVED the LOVEbird but it was a heaping amount of soul food leaving him in a food coma. My scallops were perfect. Can't recommend them enough. I tried really hard not to order desert, but as soon as I saw they had a Dirt Sundae I folded. When deserts were brought out they also brought out a plate saying happy birthday with some small deserts. Very sweet! \n\nHighly recommend for a birthday and/or date night. Go for the cocktails and when in doubt always order desert.",

  "text": "I stopped in here for a nice brunch before starting the day. We ordered a lime daiquiri, a small gumbo cup and a creole combination, as well as the soup of the day - corn and crawfish chowder - which was gone before I could even snap a photo.\n\nThe chowder was AMAZING. I don't know how they managed to get charred flavor into the soup, but it was so so delicious. I might be especially partial to this because I love my soups with corn, but my boyfriend loved this too!\n\nWe got the creole combination to try just a little bit of everything. The red shrimp creole was a tomato-based dish, it wasn't too epic on its own but was a nice complement to the others. The jambalaya was the highlight for me - moist and extremely tasty. We also got a cup of gumbo that was interesting - I haven't had this in a long time (had it once really long ago in a ransom seafood boil restaurant) so it was a rather new taste/texture to me. It wasn't my favorite dish of the day, but it wasn't bad!\n\nAlso, pretty good prices for the area. :)",

Sometimes, I'm feeling tea and other days I'm feeling coffee. If you haven't figured out already, I'm not the hugest coffee fanatic; I mainly enjoy going to hipster coffee places like these to enjoy the ambiance and the serenity of the place. \n\nThe menu is pretty limited, but the coffee beans are on point! They get their coffee beans from a number of places in South America and they are available for purchase. They have indoor and outdoor seating and I love how the cafe is designed! The interior is different in colors from the outside, with the outside being more colorful with their colored chairs. \n\nThe location is a little bit aways from State St, which is preferred if you are looking for a quieter location to read a book or to enjoy a first date :) \n\nPrices are standard for a coffee place in Downtown SB. I ordered a cold brew and the quality of the coffee was amazing. They also use some high quality organic milk! Baristas are friendly and there to help you decide if you're super indecisive like I.",

They continue to host great musicians pretty much every night of the week. That hasn't changed. :)\n\nSince my last review, Greg, Kelly, and their team have made some positive changes that are important to share. The first is more coverage from the elements - you're still outside, but there is more shade and cooling/heat depending on the season. The next is service. Our recent experiences have been great with prompt delivery of food and frequent check-ins from the server. Finally, there are more vegetarian options available, including some specials!\n\nThroughout a trying year, Monterey Court not only looked after the safety of their customers, but also listened to them to further improve customer experience. If you haven't already, come give them a try!",

Then look no further! \n\nAll jokes aside, I really wish I had looked at reviews before I stayed here. \n\nIt looks like most of the reviews here are from long-term tenants or Airbnb hosts, so I figured I'd give a report of what it's like to actually stay here. (This is not a review of the specific apartment where I stayed, rather the complex.) \n\nThink of this place like a glorified hostel with less rules. Chaos reigns mua ha ha! *insert meme of Elmo standing in front of fire*\n\nThe app to open all seven doors to get to your apartment is slow and poorly marked. \n\nIs it 11pm and you want to open up the hallway door to the another hallway? Ha ha, sucker, try to guess from the list of 25 different hallways! Can't find it? Too bad!\n\n+1 star for cool decor, but it all honestly seems like a facade for a poorly run operation.",

There is a big clock on the wall and a train schedule just like you would find at a real train station. The restaurant itself is not the largest, but I haven't found many places in Nashville that are. Although it is small, the room has very tall ceilings and it feels large and somewhat impersonal. The fare is typical for a steak house with a bit of a southern flare. I had the filet with seasonal veggies and sweet potatoes. It was cooked perfectly and tasted very good. Although their wine list is not particularly impressive we did manage to find a pinot from Oregon that was pretty awesome. We were there pretty late and so they ran out of the cheesecake we really wanted but we had a chocolate souffle that was also great. This place is a good alternative for chains like Morton's or Ruth Chris.",

The noodles were on the soft side which I liked. I ended up drinking the broth because it's that good. My gf got the Terakawa Ramen, which is their signature ramen dish. It is a creamy broth and the texture of the noodle is on the firm side.

  "text": "On a recent visit to Philly with my vegan cousin, we happened to accidentally stumble into V Street completely unplanned. It was centrally located just 3 blocks away from our hotel, so we ended up eating there 3 days in a row, it was that good. \n\nThe first day, we were just planning on getting drinks, and then ended up getting some snacks after realizing it was a 100% vegan restaurant. I ordered the Pico and La Brea cocktail with the activated charcoal, making the drink look pitch black. It tastes like adults lemonade and was refreshing and delicious. My cousin ordered the Jade Rabbit, and she was not a fan, as she thought it was way too floral tasting. We also tried the Peruvian Fries, which I highly recommend. They're definitely on the spicy side, but they're a perfect snack when you're drinking cocktails. We also tried their daily soft serve, which was a tahini soft serve with cherries. It tasted kind of like peanut butter, and we both really liked it. \n\nThe second night we sat down for a full dinner. My cousin tried the Dan Dan noodles, which were definitely on the spicy side, but since she loves spicy food, she adored them. I ordered the smoked beet langos, which were probably my favorite thing we ordered the whole time we were in Philadelphia. The combination of the soft bread and the sauerkraut remoulade was so flavorful and delicious. If you're debating ordering them, definitely do. You won't be disappointed! \n\nWe also stopped by for Saturday brunch, where we got the Byblos Bubbles cocktail (their take on a mimosa), which was bubbly and a little sweet, and basically the perfect brunch cocktail. We split an order of the okinamiyaki fries, which felt to me like a vegan poutine. Definitely recommend those! We also tried the Korean fried tempeh tacos, which I also highly recommend! It tasted almost exactly like a fried fish taco. We both inhaled them and seriously debated ordering seconds. We split the grilled avocado, with scrambled tofu soft tacos. The grilled avocado was delicious, and the tacos were also very pleasant. \n\nVegan or not, this place is amazing.",

Two of my friends recommended nirvana and I am so grateful!! Coming from  the Bay Area my expectations were pretty high for the quality of dip nails.  This nail salon is excellent, if you get the talented nail tech. \nSuper excited to have found a great nail tech with skills. This is extremely important with dip nails, if they don't know how to do your nails right it can crack or chip in the matter of 2 weeks which is a total waste. \n\nI also love their deluxe pedicure. They really pamper you.",

  "text": "Yeeroh was such a good takeout experience! My partner and I shared the mix grill platter (which had Greek sausage, pork souvlaki, chicken souvlaki,  beef and lamb kebab, pork belly, all piled on top of fries and pita bread with onions and tomatoes). It came with tzatziki sauce as well on the side. We also ordered a side of dolmades and a small side eggplant dish and we absolutely loved it all. The dolmades were slightly sweet, which was a little different than other dolmades that we've had, and the eggplant was also delicious- it wasn't baba ganoush like we thought it might be but still good, more on the bright and pickled kind of flavor spectrum. The mix grill platter was plenty of food for the two of us- they really piled in the fries and meats. The only thing is that I kind of wish they had given us actual pita pockets on the side and not sliced triangles of it on the bottom where it got slightly lost and soggy.  Overall though, would highly recommend if you're craving Greek food, everything was cooked to perfection and absolutely delicious and fresh tasting. The sausages were our favorite out of the mix and we'll be back for more!",

  "text": "I love this place. The donuts are cheap and fresh. They always seem to be open when I want one, unlike ALL of the donut places downtown that close at 1-2pm. The downside is that it is cash only! Parking can be hard, but every time I just park at the gas station.\n\nIf you have never been here before I suggest trying to go at an off time for them, like after morning rush so that you aren't hustled through and have time to look at everything. They have your basic donuts, some cupcakes, pecan rolls, cream horn, and Mary Ann's. \n\nMost people who tend to come here have been coming to Longs for forever so they know what they want. It always seems crazy busy in the mornings (till about 10) and then around lunch and dinner. \n\nOverall, try this place out! Good, cheap donuts with no frill. They have long hours so pretty much whenever you feel like a donut they will be there for you!",

The shopping complex is pretty much new. So they have a small seating area. They prepared the food to order. So expect a wait. Or call ahead. I will say my order was worth the wait.  The menu selection is nice, & big. I love all the wing flavors.  Lots of variety on that subject.  I ordered the the 10pc boneless wings with fries n Texas toast. My Friend ordered the 10pc. Wings with fies n Texas toast. The sauces I got was nuclear habbenero, n tame. Not a fan of tame. Loved the other 1. It wasn't overpriced.  But a few dollars more than u'd wanna spend",

  "text": "I was excited to try this restaurant after looking at the Yelp reviews and pictures but I wasn't really pleased at all!\n\nFirst, it took over 30 minutes to find parking, so we ending up finding a parking lot and paying $18 for 2 hour parking.  Although this has nothing to do with the Restaurant I wanted to point this out, as this was my first experience with New Orleans Parking.\n\nThe restaurant is very small.  When we arrived at the restaurant it was a total of 5 people with us and we were waiting on 6 more people.  I realized this was maybe not the best restaurant after seeing how small this place was but after looking for parking, finding a parking lot and then walking 3 blocks to this place and traveling with kids  we were exhausted and I was still morning time so we stayed here.\n\nThere was no wait when the 5 of us arrived, so we were seated quickly.  The tables they have seat 4 so we had to combine to tables.  We noticed the restaurant filling up as we were waiting on 4 others to arrive with us so we went ahead and ordered our food.  We waited about 45 minutes before our food came and it was cold!  I love Eggs Benedict, so I was really excited to try the Blackened Catfish eggs Benedict with spinach! I was so disappointed in this dish, not only was my food cold but the catfish was not blackened and it was under seasoned.  My mom ordered french toast and this bread was about 4 inches thick, and tasted very dense!  She ended up ordering pancakes afterwards. \n\nThen on top of the poor quality of the food, a waitress came to our table and informed us we had been there long enough and they had other customers waiting so I was time for us to leave!! These were literally there exact words!!  Once the other 4 of our party came they waited in line about 15 minutes and were told they couldn't sit with us, so they were seated in another area.  We ended up leaving shortly after but I was so disappointed and upset that they told us to leave in such and abrupt manner!!  I won't be returning to this restaurant on out next visit to New Orleans.",

  "text": "Reminiscing about living & Santa Barbara & Sam's To Go came to mind. \n\nMany moons ago, when I was much younger, I worked in a prime location in SB off Hitchcock Way, as a professional match maker. One of the best things about being where I worked was the proximity of GREAT food spots near by.\n\nWhenever I was in the mood for a great sandwich, which was about 1-2 times a week, I would order from here. \n\nAt the time there were 2 Sam's To Go sandwich shops & I believe the owners were family members that were rivals (I thought this funny when the owner told me all the reasons why his sandwich shop was better than the others). \n\nAnyways, I digress. My ALL-TIME-FAVE at the time was the #27 Avo, Turkey, Bacon & Cheese (I called it the ABCT- even though it also had lettuce & tomato). This had EVERYTHING you wanted! Even though I am now a plant-based vegan, just thinking about this sandwich still makes my mouth water! \n\nI always ordered a large, & even that wasn't enough for me! \n\nJust go! Try any one of the sandwiches. All that I've had were outstanding. I'm not even sure why they were so great, it's just a sandwich, but it was also more than that. It was the perfect amount of everything. The meat, bread ration was perfect & they seemed to always have the right amount of mayo & mustard. Maybe it was just how much love & care they put into making each one. They had so much pride in what they did. Fond memories, I will always have!",

So it is a South African Portuguese place! Supposedly the main seller here is the Peri-Peri flavour that they use on the foods. \n\nThe place was really cool on the inside! The decor was funky and very green! I love the colour green and it gave the restaurant a bright and trendy vibe. \n\nThey give you a table and number and then you order at the front counter. I'm not really sure why they do it that way? But it seemed to work OK. I got the veggie burger with LOTS of hot sauce. The sauce is flavourful but wasn't as spicy as I thought. BUT DON'T WORRY - there are 4 different hot sauces at every table to make your food better. I also had garlic mashed potatoes which were really yummy. My friend had the chicken livers and he said it was delicious. A lot of my friends actually eat here all the time! \n\nThey cleared our plates right away and then we were out of there. All in all it only took about half an hour, the food comes out quick! So that's always a plus in my books! :)",

The twig still no help.\n\nBy this time, we got our cups and started filling with yogurt and then went to the toppings bar.  The counter was dirty, the cherries were practically empty, the pineapples looked like hell and then (I wish I got a pic of this)....the caramel in the squeeze bottle was so disgusting full of caramel on the outside of the container, I couldn't even touch it to show the guy it needed to be cleaned.  He apologized and then asked the twig to help clean it up.  She took it in the back and apparently washed the top but when it came back to us it had water INSIDE the squeeze bottle!

  "text": "Listen up, burger makers:  THIS is how to make a veggie burger!  Don't assume that all vegetarians desire minimal toppings, a dry, multigrain bun, and a low-moisture cheese (I'm looking at you Delux Burger).  We actually do like additional toppings.  And we really do enjoy flavour.  And this is why I go to Rodeo Burgers.\n\nI love that at Rodeo Burgers, everything is customizable, the toppings and the patty.  I don't get nickled and dimed for making substitutions (veggie patty for beef or guac for pancetta, like at other burger joints), and I don't get charged for toppings I don't want (I hate paying for bacon that never touches my patty).  Some toppings cost extra at Rodeo Burger, but my favourites, the sauteed mushrooms and carmelized onions are complimentary.  Love that!\n\nOverall, the burgers are good, not the best veggie ever, but better than many.  The patties are a bit thin and tend to fall apart when eating, and if you load up with toppings like I do, then you are dealing with a very messy burger.  But I guess that's part of the fun.  The fries are fantastic, and I thought the portion sizes were fine.\n\nIf I craving a burger, or just want a tasty, inexpensive meal in the University area, I head to Rodeo Burgers.  This is the one burger joint in town that values the vegetarian as much as the omnivore.  Thanks, Rodeo Burgers!",

AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!!!\n\nlol i have very bipolar feelings about this place.  i want to love it but i really can't .. mostly because my wallet won't let me.  so i stopped in today to grab a salad.  never been.. but saw some glowing reviews on yelp so i thought \"heeey what the duck, lemme try!\"\n\nso i got the sunflower seed caesar salad.... $13.50 after tax O_O!!!!! my insides ached a little bit T_T;; but partially my fault too b/c i just love trying new places...  surely, the salad is more unique than your ubiquitous saladworks.  the sunflower seed caesar is mostly kale based, finely chopped, and mixed with a lighter hue of romaine.  it comes with dried up shiitake mushrooms that taste like bacon and some crunchy peas that reminds me of those wasabi peas.... it's served with a miso dressing which adds to the nice fusion mix.  everything tastes mighty fine.  not gonna lie, it definitely tastes snazzy compared to your regular saladworks.  but i really dunno if the taste and its fancy organic properties can truly justify the premium price! heck i don't even like that much dressing on my salad and i doused the whole saucer of dressing into my bowl to get every ounce of what i paid for.  (btw DON\"T DO THIS! b/c it ended up being too salty and ... spicy?!) \n\nso all in all, the cafe has a beautiful organic setting.  very down to earth and relaxing ambiance.  not a bad place to chill on a sunday afternoon.  but sadly for me, i cannot afford this luxury salad daily.  i'm sure it's aimed to a different target group since it is located at the heart of center city next to rittenhouse.  i probably wont be returning anytime soon unfortunately.. \n\njust trying to give people a heads up before coming here~",

This used to be Brandt's?!\" Soft colors, great lighting, and a bar I wouldn't mind sitting at while sipping some wine.\n\nI need to come back during dinner because I feel like that experience would be even better than lunch... I only have a couple of gripes as far as the atmosphere goes. First, why do restaurant owners let customers eat in complete silence?! I knew going for a late lunch it'd probably be quiet in there, but I just think a little bit of music (instrumental, something, anything) makes the experience seem a little bit better. Second, our server came up and just asked us what we wanted. I feel like with a new restaurant, a short blurb or explanation of the concept is really nice, that way you know what they're going for. Our waitress was lovely, I just would've liked to get the DL on the place before I dove into the menu.\n\nMy eyes always go straight for the cheese plate, so that was up first. It was definitely one of the best ones I've had! To my surprises, all three cheeses were VERY strong instead of at least one being mild, but I loved that. I'm not sure exactly what they were, but one was a bleu cheese drizzled in honey... yes please. It was served with house-made focaccia and met all expectations. For lunch I had the spinach salad, which was extremely simple but in a good kind of way. Accompanied by a dollop (I hate that word) of house-made cheese, pine nuts, and other goodies, I definitely got my dose of phyto-nutrients and it tasted great while doing it.\n\nI will definitely come back for dinner! So glad to have Nico in the neighborhood.",

I used to power lift until I pulled my back out, now I just lift heavy weights and have a great time. And eat. I eat a lot. \n\nThe gym owner at my old gym upset me with his misogynistic comments and consistent inability to take constructive feedback. I went there for 17 months. I made some fantastic progress, and I'm a natural- regular gym rat if you will. I love being in the gym.\n\nAnyhow, yes. I'm a lunk. PF gets such a bad name from my big male counterparts. Let's face it. I'll never use a 110 lb dumbbell. I'm off of the oly bars for a bit, due to injury- so we are going light weight more reps. Guess what? Still a lunk. This. Gym. Has. Everything. Except a squat rack. Dumbbells, loaded barbells, machines, lots of cables, benches, etc. \n\nThe staff here is super friendly. They were patient during registration. They answer all of my questions, including my \"do you guys really have Pizza?\" Question.  They answered with a \"you don't like Pizza?!?!\" Omg of course I do. Who doesn't like pizza?! I just hope it's not from Papa Johns. \n\nMe teenager has been with me free with my black card twice now. I love that it gives us this time together, and that he's completely comfortable working out here. I don't think it would be the case at my old gym. \n\nHere's to many many workouts together PF. To the naysayers, I say that you can get a good workout in anywhere. I will revisit the squat rack issue at a later time.",

I don't know what the place was like before the new owner took over but I can say these guys know what they're doing. The hookah was awesome! I had peach-mint, which is what I always order. My fav!! With the pineapple his time. Never tried that. Honestly I couldn't tell the difference. I'll probably pass on it next time. \n\nAnyway....we had a private room. Which was cool and exclusive feeling. The seats could be cushioned up a bit, they were pretty hard on my bum. And maybe some pillows?? Just to give it a little more laid back feel. I felt a bit stiff sitting up the way I had to. But still wasn't upset about it. \n\nIt's was a bit warm when I went in, but our awesome waitress, Emily, turned the air up. She was awesome. Did I say that already??! But yea...very attentive and informative. It was my first time there so she gave me a good run down of the joint. \n\nAs far as food goes...a friend I was with knew more about this spot and so I let them order for me. \n\nLamb chops plate and a shrimp plate\n\nBoth came with salad and hummus. With bread. It was my first time trying hummus and all I can say is I'm not really a fan. I don't eat salad, sorry don't sue me. But the shrimp were cooked to perfection! I mean they were so plump and big and juicy and totally not overcooked... Just perfect!! Also the lamp chops were tender and moist and super flavorful!! \n\nI really loved this place... I can definitely see myself returning alone just chill out get some work done on the laptop... Free Wi-Fi by the way... smoke a small hookah, eat some juicy shrimp...And just vibe out....",

She selected this place based on the reviews, and let me tell you that if I could give The Eagle more than five stars, I would. A day later, my friend and I are still raving about how wonderful the food was, how big the drinks were, and how good the service was. \n\nThere was a 5 minute wait when we arrived, just for a quick clearing of a table, and then the waitress was very helpful in telling us her recommendations and accommodating us with what we needed. The cocktails are $10, and they're HUGE and tasty, so for this price, I was super impressed. The food itself was amazing. We had a half chicken (what they're famous for), mac and cheese, cornbread, and mashed potatoes, and the combo of it all was just the best. If you enjoy a southern style of food, then you will LOVE the food here.\n\nThey have indoor and outdoor seating, and it's just a really large area, so I can't imagine a longer wait than 15-20 tops during anytime, anyday. I can't wait to go back to Indianapolis and to The Eagle. Give it a try, you won't be sorry!",

  "text": "A great Asian fusion place in little old Warminster. It replaced what was the best Chinese place (David, you're missed) and has taken over as Asian king of the last stop on the R2.\n\nThe place is sprawling -- more open space than when it was David's, mostly because the gigantic fish tank that once lined the back wall is no more. Never overly busy (which is a bummer because I'd like it to stay in business), so I've always been seated immediately. The staff is very friendly, sticking around to chat for a few minutes each time they come to the table rather than just take you order and move on.\n\nHave been for dinner several times with friends and family and every time has been a positive experience for all diners. I'm a big fan of their pad thai, which is what I almost always order (because there's always enough left over for lunch the next day). I wasn't a fan of the crispy duck in raspberry cognac sauce, but the Yazmin Peking Duck served with Hong Kong style buns is great. The other times I've ventured away from the pad thai, it's been very yummy, especially the honey walnut chicken and bun dac biet. Yazmin is BYOB and they'll chill your wine, if you please.\n\nOn a few occasions when my party has declined to order dessert, we were served complimentary desserts anyway.\n\nGood for Asian cuisine lovers in the Philly burbs.",

  "text": "Ah Surreys, my initial NOLA brunch love affair. While others have come and gone you have remained a steadfast institution of veggie friendly brunchy goodness, so much so that even your hatred of credit cards can't keep me away. The long and short of it:\n\n1. Biscuits and Mushroom Gravy. My favorite thing on the menu. I like this so much that we often order it as a side knowing full well that it could constitute a small meal. It's the perfect combination of think, savory, salty, mushroomy deliciousness. Totally worth it even if you can't eat it all.\n\n2. Cash Only. They don't take credit cards here. There's an ATM on site but it comes with a $3.00 transaction fee plus whatever your bank charges for not using their ATM. Best to just come prepared with cash.\n\n3. Bread Bread Bread. All of their bread items (toast, biscuits, bagels, etc.) are fresh baked and amazing. This is the real thing that keeps me coming back.\n\n4. BYOB. They don't serve alcohol, so bring your own! We usually sport a bottle of champagne to pour into their freshly squeezed juices!\n\n5. Juice Juice Juice. They offer a variety of fresh squeezed juice. Take my advice, a fresh apple-cucumber mimosa will make any morning. They also offer the addition of ginger or kale.\n\n6. Veggies. Lots of veggie friendly dishes. The veggie burger is decent and the ginger tofu scramble is to die for.\n\n7. Size. The place is tiny, popular, and doesn't take reservations. Pretty much any weekend before noon will result it a decently long wait.\n\n8. Salmon. I used to order their salmon scramble and bagel plate with lox until I discovered Coulis further into uptown. Surreys isn't bad but it still pales in comparison (Coulis just tastes so much fresher). It really all depends on how much you want salmon.\n\nSurreys is good enough to warrant a long wait that will involve a trip to the ATM. One of my original favorites that's withstood the test of time for even my fickle pallet. \n\nOverall Grade: B+",

  "text": "I can understand why there's a line for this place. We waited with the other barbecue lovers for over a half hour on a recent chilly Saturday night. It was worth it. You can mix it up however you want to here...I opted for a 4 rib dinner, which comes with one side, and a 4 oz. portion of pulled pork. I got green beans for a side ( haricot vert...nice touch!) and added a side of their smoked 3 bean salad. I like the set up...place your meat order with the first person you meet, they plate it (or more accurately \"tray\" it) and send you on to the person who plates your sides, then on to the cash register and any add ons...bourbon vanilla caramel shake, anyone? When it's busy, however, this process can take a few minutes, and the meat was cold by the time I got to the table. That's my only complaint, and I prefer barbecue a touch under temperature to reheated meat any day, so it's a small one. \n\nI really like these ribs. They're meaty and nicely smoked, and whatever rub they use is slight. They also let you sauce them yourself, which I really appreciate. The coffee sauce worked well with the ribs, as it did for the pulled pork, which was equally delicious. The only other sauce I liked was the sweet sauce; the hot one didn't taste great to me, and wasn't spicy either. The sides were very good and thoughtfully prepared. There's some good cooking going on here as well as some nicely smoked meats. I'll definitely be back.",

  "text": "I noticed this place the first time I went all the way up to this area to check out Cafe Soho as it's only about a minute away from it.  I love tofu and Korean food, and after reading the good Yelp reviews, I knew it was a place I had to check out especially now with Miga in downtown Philly being closed.  \n\nThe decor is all wooden and what I assume is old traditional Korean style.  We were seated immediately and given menus.  In less than a minute we were brought a pitcher of water and the waiter was ready to take our order.  However, I wasn't that familiar with the menu, so we weren't ready yet.  I decided on the pa-jun (Korean pancake), that I seem to order at every Korean restaurant I go to because I like it so much, and an order of the vegetarian mushroom soft tofu stew.  The waiter asked us if we were sure we didn't want seafood and not the vegetarian pajun.  I will eat seafood, but I'm not too fond of the octopus and squid that usually end up in Korean food.  I told him I preferred the vegetable one.\n\nAbout 6 Banchan (Korean side dishes) were brought out including:  Kimchi, beansprout salad, seaweed salad, and a few other things that I'm not sure exactly what they were.  They were okay, but I've had better at other places. We were also brought a raw egg, which I assumed was for our stew.   Our food came out within five minutes, and then the waiter was never to be seen again until we flagged him down for a check.  \n\nThe pajun was okay, but only had scallions in it.  At other restaurants when I order the vegetarian one, other veggies like kimchi, peppers, mushrooms, or carrots are usually included as well, so that was a bit disappointing.  The tofu stew was good and boiling hot in temperature and spice, but I didn't think it was superior to ones at other restaurants.  I did like the rice in the stone bowl, but it was really hard to get it off the sides and no one came around and poured the warm water/tea in our stone bowl at the end of the meal like others had written about.  We also were not instructed what to do with the egg (I wasn't sure if it was for the rice in the stone bowl or the stew), and the server dropped off the food so quickly and ran off that I couldn't even ask.  I wasn't getting any 3G on my phone, so I couldn't check back here on Yelp, so I guessed and put it in the stew.  It tasted good though.\n\nThe best part of the meal was the low price.  We only paid a little over $20 for the whole meal for the two of us and we left feeling full.  I would go back if I was in the area for the stew again, but I don't think I'm going to drive out of the way for it since the service was a little lackluster and I can get similar dishes at other places.",

It is the same plaza that Feet First (running store), Pilot Bank, Massage Studio, Starbucks, Soleil Tanning, and Taco Fusion are all in. \n\nWhen we arrived we were able to park right up front. They have some spots reserved just for Kelp customers. We were also pretty happy to see the outdoor seating because it was a gorgeous day out. A couple actually had their puppy with them at their table outside :) Note that there is also indoor seating. It's a small place and I'm not sure how busy they get but between the indoor and outdoor seating, you should be good.\n\nTheir lunch options are great. For $12 you get 2 full rolls, a miso soup and a ginger salad. I went with that option. My friend got 2 rolls (see my pictures) and she really enjoyed them both. And their lunch, all the way until 4pm!\n\nService was very nice. Everyone was very friendly. They were attentive and the service was nice and fast.\n\nBasically, I'll be back for more :)",

The house bbq is delicious but my favorite choices today were the 5 cane and sweet heat sauces. Grab a few small containers and try them all! \n\nThe meat honestly doesn't \"need\" sauce. It stands apart on its own. The brisket and pulled pork were perfect. The smoked sausage has a classic Cajun green onion flavor and available hot or mild. \n\nThe coleslaw is very unique. It has pickled hot peppers in the mix that give it a spice and flare I haven't seen before and very much enjoyed. You have got to get the maque choux Mac n cheese. It's the best possible fusion between two amazing dishes and next time I'll order two so I don't have to share with my daughter! \n\nI will be back, sooner rather than later!",

All the reviews to this place seem to be spot on. Love the decor first of all... wish I could add a picture of my pooch to the wall. Great selection of beers on tap and semidecent menu, mainly comprised of sandwiches. I went with the cheese burger and it was Mmmmm good. I think I've send this about most of my reviews in Philly but this burger so so moist and juicy that I still drool just thinking about. Kind of small burger, but it what it loses in diameter it gains in thickness. A very fulfilling meal and the fries (idaho and sweet potatoes mixed) were great compliment to the burger as well. My server/waitress was very kind and she always made sure to check up on me. \n\nGreat time and I recommend this place to anyone who comes here.",

There were still a few stragglers from lunch - the vibe is dark and soothing, gentle Moby tracks were wafting and the lighting low.  Service prompt and attentive, panko fried avocado appy was delicious with hot mayo.  The Wasabi roll was beautifully presented and tasty but devoid of wasabi, no matter plenty to dip into on the other plates.  The Maguro and Saba were both delicious and generously cut.  A ginger Martini thingy was quite lovely.  We split all this for $55, it seemed a little pricey and it is far from home but definitely A-OK.  Private rooms and hibachi tables available.",

I used to love the spicy chicken sandwich--it was the only thing on the menu I would ever order.  I still love it, but NOW they have fabulous burgers too!\n\nThey use the same local beef (from Triple L Ranch in Franklin I think?) that Burger Up does, and Melrose has an excellent selection of cheeseburgers now.  It's great for Sunday \"brunch\" too--if you've got a good hangover.  I recommend the sunshine burger (think that's what it's called, something similar if not that)--a fried egg on top of the burger patty with cheese.  YUM and I can only eat it once a year unless I'm training for a marathon.  Can't imagine the calorie intake, but it certainly made me feel better after a particular heavy binge the night before.\n\nThursday nights, Melrose is still the place to be.  2 for 1 drinks and a big crowd--ranging from 20-40-somethings.  Laid back and unassuming, this is a favorite bar for sure.",

This is a good thing. \n\nThe cocktails: I'm a big fan of tiki drinks, and the drinks here hit the spot. From margaritas to mojitos, these drinks hit the spot. Beer choices however, are lacking. With only 6-7 choices, and maybe one local selection, it leaves the beer lovers out quite a bit.\n\nThe service: service is hit or miss, sometimes. Servers are friendly, helpful and nice, but if sitting on the back patio it might be awhile before you see a server. \n\nThe atmosphere: Super.Cool. It's island flair gives a welcoming air, Andy the copper bar tops and open design lets light stream in the inside seating area. The back patio is a great place to hang on a cool evening.\n\nThe pricing is a little more than I'd like - guacamole and chips, and tacos  are a little pricier than expected.",

  "text": "First thing about this place that caught me off guard was a lack of menu.  \nJust...coffee?  That's just assumed by all who enter?\n\nHowever, I'm not complaining [but I did feel a bit like a moron]; maybe I'm too American (read: Starbucks).  I just ordered a latte, got my sugar, and [luckily] found a seat to do some work.\n\nThe latte was thick and creamy.  The espresso was good--not bitter at all.\n\nThe little cafe has a modern European feel and the people watching varied greatly.  In my opinion, the set-up is a tad awkward in ordering, picking up your drink, and adding sugar, etc.  But, again, maybe I'm just not used to this type of setting.  I noticed a lot of customers took their coffee to go, here, so that feeds into the weird vibe.\n\nIts almost not a coffee shop.  Yet it is, in the most literal sense.\nBut the constant to-goers sort of takes away from any coziness at this location. Especiallly when winter air is slapping you in the face with every door opening and closing.\n\n I enjoyed the experience overall, however, and can see why others love it.  I almost really appreciate the simplicity of it all.  They brew good coffee, and that's it.\n  \n(And at this price point, it definitely is good enough coffee)",

I posted a photo to show how beautifully the style held up throughout my wedding day. Kaylee was so sweet and skillful, and her positive vibes really enhanced my wedding prep process. Thank you so much, Kaylee!\n\nAs far as the actual business, everything was clean and beautiful (I love the pops of yellow and fun product names). Check in was simple and there is a small waiting area with all of the latest magazines to browse. I enjoyed a mimosa during my styling session.

  "text": "I am excited that there is a restaurant like Blue Duck Sandwich Company in North East Philly.  Living closer to downtown there so many awesome restaurant options but in the North East where I work it's mostly chains restaurants or less than exciting pizza/bar food type places.  Now getting my co-works to branch out of just a basic salad or sandwich can be challenging at times.  But despite their preference for boring food choices they seem to be ok with the small and unique menu offered at Blue Duck Sandwich Company.  And one of them actually frequents the place regularly.\n\nLove the décor of the place has a very farm to table feel to it.  It's very bright inside; the only issue I have is that both times we went it's been extremely cold to the point where I debated eating with my coat on.  They were out of their signature sandwich and the produce truck hadn't come so no tomatoes for the bbblt on our second visit which was a little disappointing since two of us planned to try the blue duck sandwich.\n\nThe Blue Duck Fries honestly could be a meal in itself, there huge the 1st time the 4 of us split them the second time I went I actually just got it as a meal neither time were they all finished.  I've tried both the bruschetta wing and general tso, both were nice and crispy but the general tso were infinitely better.  Two of my co-works are picky about Chicken Salad and raved about the club, so if you're picky too this one might be worth a try.  I really enjoyed the portabella burger the roasted red pepper aoli really topped it off.  Both the fried chicken sandwich and quack & cheese looked yummy.  If you're not into cheese the cheese on the salt and pepper fires comes on the side.  It's a different sauces from the blue duck fires both are tasty I can decided which I like better probably leaning towards the one on the blue duck fires.",

  "text": "Reading the other yelpers' reviews on here was very perplexing.  And like so many others, I don't see any possible justification for the low scores, so had to check it out.\n\nAdmittedly, hubby and I had never been to a Brazilian steakhouse before.  Who are these other yelpers who have experienced so much that leave us lowly native Middle Tennesseans \"in the dust\" culinary wise I wonder?  We've been to many places and experienced great dinners from all sorts of realms - so while this was new for us, it's not like it's our first dinner out.\n\nWe visited on Saturday night at 7 PM with reservations between Christmas and New Year's.  The restaurant had a few other guests, but not too many at all, and just felt \"cool.\"  We were seated at a table where we could look out over Belcourt Avenue through the (permanently closed) glass-paned garage doors, and it provided basically dinner and a show.  We're Cool Springs people... and couldn't go over all the cabs dropping off diners for Sunset, Cabana, and here.\n\nNote - very recently, like the past month, I'm told a second Brazilian steakhouse opened on Second Avenue next to Melting Pot. Don't know if that means anything, but just thought I'd mention as a possible explanation for the low crowds.\n\nOur very kind waiter explained the steakhouse what's-going-to-happen, and brought us our drinks and beginning sides.  The salad bar was very well appointed and presented well - all the items were in geometic, interesting bowls and perfectly-molded together-but-crushed ice, it was really lovely.  Nice greek salad, excellent smoked salmon, fruits, chicken salad, olives... I don't know what more you could ask for honestly.\n\nWe finished our salads and enjoyed some absolutely fabulous rolls (small warm cheesey yet yeasty, yum!) and then once our waiter magically appeared at exactly the right moment with fresh plates, we flipped our little cards over to green.  Within like 30 seconds, the first \"meat steward\" appeared with filet on a sword, and we took our little tongs to accept a slice, then steward #2 was RIGHT behind him with BBQ chicken wings he popped off his skewer.  Not 30 seconds later, another meat steward with Parmesean Pork, another beef something or another, pulling right in like it was commuter traffic and there's a guy with lamb and grilled pineapple - yum!\n\nWe immediately saw the value in pace of eating, so we flipped our cards to red to enjoy for a bit.  The filet was excellent, BBQ chicken excellent, lamb excellent... was it the best ribeye ever?  Not for my taste.  There wasn't any meat in the 12 courses we tried allowing for a repeat round of \"visits\" that I'd say we disliked, but we did have favorites.  Our waiter checked on us periodically, and mentioned more than once if there was any specific meat we wanted to visit just let him know.  A BBQ rib selection was a favorite as well, but honestly we were so full - the only repeat we asked for was the grilled pineapple for the \"palate cleanser\" appeal.\n\nOur service throughout from both our designated waiter and all the numerous meat stewards was very good - we never felt like we were waiting for anything.  The experience overall was very good, because honestly it's something different.  We can go have a very nice $100 dinner lots of places, but only here can you have multiple meat stewards come by with kabobs on swords and try a little bit of everything - and at this point in life we are all about trying something different.\n\nWe did use a Groupon for $35 discount, but our tab which included 18% grat (their norm when customers use a coupon) for the other dinner and three cocktails was $90.  A little pricey, but not ridiculously so considering the uniqueness in my opinion.  We would very well go back, probably for a special occasion and using a Groupon/Living Social deal again since that seems to be easily done.",

He ordered a Boulavardier. It was a smokey delight! \n\nThe bread arrived and it was warm, yeasty, doughy goodness with a sweet creamy butter. We could have asked for a bucket of that to go and been fine! But... \n\nWe moved on to appetizers - we share everything - so one ordered the Brussels Sprouts with Calabrian Chilies ... OMG.. probably the best Brussels we've ever had. Perfectly cooked and the chilies gave it such great flavor. We added the Duck Rillettes with Mango Mostarda - I thnk i was delirious after one bite. \n\nWe tried the Asparagus and Spring Onion Soup... Was that tarragon? Pernod? How did you make ASPARAGUS taste so amazing!? \n\nOnto Dinner - Moroccan Chicken Breast for me and Lamb Shank for him. Both were superb. \n\nWe brought a bottle of wine from our cellar to share. So - no opinion on the wine list. \n\nThe service was great.

  "text": "You should definitely visit Zollicoffee. Even if your not a coffee fan, you will find something to love about this place. Less than a mile from my son's school, I find myself here quite a bit. They have interesting seasonal syrup flavors - and Zolli makes all the specialty syrups himself. Lavender, blueberry, strawberry, mocha cayenne, chocolate basil, etc. They have comfy couches, as well as regular tables. Lots of board games and some books to read. Outdoor seating w a giant Jenga game on a table. WONDERFUL employees. Always delightful. My favorite food item is the yogurt with granola and fruit. My son's favorite is the homemade Chex mix. My daughter is a huge cane of the fruity pebbles rice crispie treats. Oh! The rice crispie treats!!!! TONS of awesome flavors. I try not to eat sweets too much, so I usually only try a little free tidbit near the cash register. HIGHLY recommend this place.",

  "text": "I loves da Schlaflys.\n\nGreat beer. In my too few days in STL, I had the following types of beer from Schlafly: Hefeweizen, Pilsner, Pale Ale. All of them were great, good quality craft beer. I really enjoyed the Tap Room too and it was fun to walk around and in to the restaurant to see the brew making machines / magicalness.\n\nWe didn't have any food at the Tap Room, just beer. But the atmosphere was cool.  Kind of like a mix of a Wisconsin bar with a lot of wood details with a urban-chic section of comfy & modern couches with a tad bit of German Brauhaus for your to make it your own stammtisch.  \n\nGreat place and I wish I lived in the STL area so I could drink more Schlafly beer.",

I love the Tropichop meals - meat over your choice of rice, beans, or salad - and they often offer bundled deals for a Tropichop and a drink for $5.  They also have a salsa and sauce bar so you can spice up your meal as you see fit.  The food is consistently good, fast, and at a good price.\n\nOne down side - I have never had a to go order come out correctly at this location.  When I ask for sauce on the side, I usually have to go in and prep it myself so I started just ordering inside.  Nice staff but they always seem a little lost and disorganized.",

Plus they charge you if you want to take a picture in one of the cars.  I love the idea of this place as I watched the show growing up.  It only take 20 minutes of your time to walk around and it is beside the Willie Nelson museum.  Why wouldn't you stop in here .\n\nMy daughter didnt think this place was all that cool, but there was room for her to walk around.  She was at least a little bit entertained.  They have the cars inside the place as well as the General Lee on the outside.  They also have a museum in the back that is dedicated to Sun records.  The cases are a little busy but for free I understand using all the space one can.",

  "text": "I think Juan's gets a lot of unnecessary flack. It is what it is. I hate that saying but it is true in Juan's case. This is not the restaurant you go to for Mexican food. But then again, it never says \"Mexican restaurant\" it says \"Creole Taquería\"; whatever the heck that means. Their margaritas are delicious but small for the price. If you like your margaritas in a \"big girl glass\" and not a \"sippie cup\" go during happy hour, they're 2 for 1 (double for the price of one). If you care that the wait staff all has tattoo sleeves and not real sleeves, don't go to Juan's. \nI have to admit, I have a soft spot for Juan's. I've been coming here since I was a lowly tourist and it was a great place to grab a drink and some food when I first moved to the city and knew no one. I have numbers in my phone that say things like \"Annie-Juan's\". These were people I first met when eating at the bar by my lonesome and we had such a great time that we continued to hang out and exchange numbers. So cut Juan's some slack huh? Food wise: I love the pork and slaw tacos (usual), the Mardi Gras Indian tacos (veggie option), and the bacon azul quesadilla (when you want something that just might kill ya, but at least it's a happy death). Happy hour really is the best time to go, cheaper drinks and fewer crowds.",

  "text": "Okay. Overall I love their cheesecake and every once in a while I BEG my fiance' to come here basically because I want that brown wheat bread they give you and I want a piece of cheesecake.  So we went last weekend.  Luckily, being a party of 2 the wait on a Saturday night was only 30 minutes but be aware to potentially wait well over an hour for a table, especially if you're a bigger party.\n\nUsually, I don't have any complaints. The food is just average and I always order off the skinnylicious menu because seriously all of their food is WAY too many calories (good luck finding items on the normal menu under 1000 cals) and if you want cheesecake with that, it's just too much for me.   But this last time our waitress was terrible.  She didn't come to check on us at ALL and she got my order wrong.  I ordered the skinnylicious chicken tacos and I got some kind of fish tacos with rice and beans.  The problem is, after we got our food, we couldn't find her or anyone that wasn't running around for that matter, so I ended up just eating it because I was starving.  She also didn't give us any refills on our drinks which was annoying, especially because I literally got water so I don't think I was costing them much.  I hope they're more attentive next time!",

  "text": "Lee How Fook is a pleasant spot to dine with friends.  It's a BYOB and we sat around after dinner, finishing our wine without feeling rushed.  Service is good (by casual Chinese restaurant standards), but food is not so much.\n\nTHE GOOD NEWS:\nSalt-baked squid is great.  Good texture, salty, tasty and fragrant.  4+ stars\n\nSauteed snow pea shoots (green leafy vegetables) are good.  I love snow pea leaves and there's nothing wrong with these! 3.5 stars\n\nWhite rice: acceptable.  Not great, not fluffy, but edible and included with meal.\n\nTHE BAD NEWS:\nPan fried wide rice noodles (ho fun) with beef: so-so, mixed.  Noodles themselves are a good texture, and fried nicely, but beef is hard to eat: overcooked, hard pieces lacking in flavour.  I was surprised by how bad the beef was, since even the mediocre Chinese restaurants I'm used to will tenderize and season their beef adequately.  Lesson learned: Avoid the beef. 2 stars for the dish.\n\nSzechuan eggplant is disappointing.  First of all, the flavour of this dish is not Szechuan at all.  Nor is it spicy.  Instead, it comes with something like a sweet and sour sauce -- and not a good one.  The texture of the eggplant was fine, tender and soft, but a disaster flavour-wise.  I normally love Chinese eggplant, but the flavour on this was such a turn-off that I didn't want to eat much of this dish.  To be avoided. 1 star.\n\nPork with mushrooms, bamboo shoots is again not something I'd want again.  Pork is overcooked, and lacked flavour.  The vegetable stuff in the dish is fine, nothing amazing, but nothing gone horribly wrong with it.  Avoid pork. 1.5 stars.\n\nSUMMARY:\nCould go back for salt-baked squid, snow pea leaves, and ho fun noodles, but I'd want to avoid anything with beef or pork.  Might need to avoid anything that requires flavouring (with sauces, slurries, etc.)  The simpler dishes seem to work best here, e.g. SQUID + SALT = yummy, GREENS + GARLIC = good.\n\nI'm putting an optimistic spin on things -- partly because I had such a great time with friends here -- but frankly, it's pretty bad when a Chinese restaurant can neither manage a dish with more than 2 main ingredients, nor pull together an acceptable sauce when so many dishes depend on it.\n\nGeneral rating ends up around 2 stars: I've definitely had better.",

  "text": "I don't know why I've never been to this festival until this year. Maybe the very strange promotional art? I thought it was going to be very hippie, and it was in a way, but it brought out a lot of people...and not all of them were hippies. I do love the idea though: arts and crafts through upcycled material...how much cooler is that?\n\nGetting there is somewhat of a pain because Highway 50 narrows down to one lane each way when you get close to the park. Add to that Oktoberfests galore, and you have a very nice recipe for \"traffic jam\". Everyone parks everywhere, but surprisingly enough, parking wasn't that big of a deal. It is really a family thing too. They have arts and crafts for the kids, indie bands playing, lots of picnic tables set up with the usual assortment of fair foods, an alpaca petting zoo, and of course, Girl Scouts selling cookies. \n\nBut the booths themselves are the showcase, and the media is quite varied, even though I heard a booth owner complain, \"It is so hard nowadays to be original.\" She was selling wire jewelry, so I guess I can see her point. And really, my favorite booths are really the unique ones like Beqi Clothing and Newberry Furniture. The Newberrys repurpose old wood for new stuff...their current thing consists of Adirondack chairs made from an old barn. And Beqi takes vintage clothing and changes it all around..she has quite the gift. The whole thing is pretty big, and it really does impress me that there are so many craftsters in the area.",

Loved the seafood gumbo that I got but there weren't a whole lot of options (which is very surprising for a gumbo FESTIVAL) hence why I'm only giving it 3 stars.. \"festival\" is kind of a big word to use for what was more a concert in the square with some gumbo.",

  "text": "After trying the cheesteaks and roast beef sandwiches at the market, make a stop here for the Trainwreck. We preferred it's meaty, spicy, greasy goodness to the iconic cheesesteak sandwich because it was packed with flavor.     The portion size was good enough for two of us to share for lunch. Try to down the sandwich quickly because the grease can make it soggy if it is sitting out a long time. We also got the beignets which are served on Sunday. I felt the doughnuts were a bit chewy because of the dough but my dining partner loved them. The sweet tea rounded everything off nicely and was a good way to wash down the lunch. Cajun is not a cuisine that instantly comes to mind when you are visiting Reading Terminal Market, but the wonderful flavors in the sandwiches served at this place is worth giving it a shot.",

Apparently this used to be a retail store only selling Mexican groceries and goods (the store is still in the back and is super cool) and recently added the restaurant portion. I ordered the mole chicken enchiladas and I'm pretty sure my order was mixed up somehow... there wasn't a hint of mole flavouring or colouring. The meal was okay, it was fresh and relatively tasty but I couldn't get past my disappointment of getting regular chicken enchiladas instead of mole (I am never the guy that would complain or correct, they are a small business trying to make it so I'll eat what I get). Served with side beans and rice, and tortilla chips and salsa to start... the best part here was the homemade hot sauces they bring out... quite the assortment of deliciousness if you are a hot sauce person too.\n\nThis is a spot I will give a second chance.

  "text": "Located just north of Grant MacEwan on busy 109 Street is Purple Bubble, and you'll see their signature purple hue coming from the windows as you drive by. I stopped by after dinner one evening to check out the space and see what they had to offer.\n\nWhile bubble tea isn't a go-to for me like it was in my younger days, I definitely appreciate a good milk tea every once in a while! At Purple Bubble there are a variety of drinks and a handful of snacks and desserts you can order as well. \n\nWhen it comes to bubble tea I'm a green tea or traditional milk tea kind of girl. The Original Milk Tea ($5.49) at Purple Bubble is smooth and isn't overly sweet. making it a winner in my books. The menu has an extensive list of milk teas, including some specialties like Hokkaido Caramel milk tea and Pudding milk tea. If tea isn't quite your thing, Purple Bubble also offers fresh fruit smoothies and fruit slush. \n\nOne thing that separates Purple Bubble from all the other bubble tea spots in the city is their Blooming Art Tea ($6.99). A clear teapot suspended over a tealight holds a single flower bulb that \"blooms\" as it steeps. It really is quite lovely to see the flower open, and it makes me think I need to get myself a clear teapot! \n\nWhen it comes to the snacks, Purple Bubble has both sweet and savoury offerings. There's the usual fries and Chinese snacks like dimsum and dumplings, but on the more interesting side there's Taiwanese fried chicken, seafood ramen, Taiwanese style rice bowls and even Korean style spicy rice cakes. As this visit was after dinner we decided on an order of Egg Waffles ($4.99) - one of my favourite street foods in Hong Kong. Very few places in the city offer egg waffles, and those that I've tried have been quite disappointing. Luckily the puffy egg waffles at Purple Bubble are the best I've had in the city. Served fresh out of the waffle maker, the waffles are light, puffy, eggy, and lightly sweetened. \n\nFor a dessert option Purple Bubble has Snow Ice ($6.99), which is their variation on a bowl of shaved ice. This dessert is available in four different flavours: Matcha, Vanilla, Strawberry, and Mango. We opted to go with the mango, and the shaved snow came topped with fresh mango chunks and a light drizzle of condensed milk. The snow was fluffy and creamy, and the mango topping sweet and fragrant. However this shaved snow did have a bit of an artificial flavouring to it, so it didn't quite hit the spot for me.\n\nPurple Bubble is in a great location along busy 109 Street and just a quick walk away from the Grant Macewan campus. It would be a great spot for students to study or catch up with friends, and it's in a place where it is convenient to stop on the commute out of downtown. I would happily stop by for some tea and egg waffles if I were in the area and craving something sweet!",

  "text": "One of my all time faves, this is the first thrift store to hit in South Philly!  Racks and bins of clothing always stuffed to the gills.  Their selection of 80s prom dresses and wedding gowns is usually jaw dropping.  And, the prices are really quite decent in comparison to other Philadelphia area shops.  I have noticed a recent raise in prices.  However, as thrifting becomes an accepted and often profitable hobby, that seems to be the nationwide trend.\n\nThere are always a fair amount of hipster types at this establishment.  But, oddly enough, this thrift store hardly ever seems picked over.\n\nBest thing:  An often large selection of boots in the fall/winter - from Frye cowboy boots, to 80s slouchies, and uber glam heeled \"hooker boots\" - I've found it all.  And, they stock a large amount of mens clothing and ties.  I find some of my best guy's stuff here.  Note: If you're a guy, always check the women's section for jeans.  Whenever I come across 70's bell bottoms and 80's skinny jeans in that section, they are usually for men.\n\nWorst thing: There are no carts.  You have to keep making trips to the front to dump your finds in their reserved bins.  I find that incredibly annoying, as I love to get lost in the shopping experience.",

  "text": "Full disclosure: the owner is a friend of mine.\n\nAnd he loves what he does. That dedication and passion for accessible cuisine really shines through here. \n\nI've probably had a third of the menu here so far - stand outs are the mac and cheese (it's not a side - share it), the banh mi sliders, the pulled pork nachos, and the homemade parmesan truffle chips. The bang bang chicken is also pretty good - be warned, however, because even though I can eat a spoonful of ghost pepper sauce and still remain coherent, the bang bang chicken made me sweat for a good 20 minutes. It's not so much a super sharp heat (6 out of 10 with ghost pepper at 9 in my opinion), but it's a sustained one. Good, but if you're not a lover of heat, you might wanna stay away.\n\nAlso, tons of beers. Ithaca beers. I'm always a bit disappointed at how many craft bars don't have Ithaca beers available, But the last few times I've been here, they had both Cascazilla and Flower Power IPA. Delicious.\n\nAlso, 5 dollars for a pour of whiskey? Seriously? Get a designated driver, and try 5 of them. \n\nIt's also a beautiful space. My kind of ambience. They also play a lot of funk, R&B, classic rock, and other selections in the dining area. Not a lot of places stray from Buddha Bar or top 40, so this was welcome change for me. Put on some James Brown and you've made my night.\n\nAlso, check out their shows and movie nights and the like throughout the week. I saw a band there last Saturday that was actually quite good. Alt rock, local band, you know the deal. I'm pissed that I forgot their name, but hey - I was 6 deep and still drinking when I got there. \n\nCheck the place out.",

  "text": "I thank all my Yelp friends and others for suggesting that I pop into Thumbelina's for my bridesmaid's dress alteration this past week since it was easily accessible from my house. I walked in on a Thursday, and said I needed my dress by Tuesday. She waved me into the changing room to make the alterations without any sort of sigh or \"tut tut\" you might get asking for a late favor.  The dress was a double layer of two opposing fabrics; one being a light fabric under a thick lace with sequins adorning it.  She pulled it tighter along the back seam and pinned it without putting any other alteration pins in it besides there. I took off the dress, and paid $32 in cash that I miraculously had on me that day. ((Cash or check only)).  I really don't know the price of alterations, but I felt like this was fine. \n\nI ended up actually picking up the dress early Wednesday morning since I pushed my flight back, and trusted that the alterations had been made correctly. \n\nFour days later I put on the dress right before my sister's wedding and loved how Thumbelina had transformed this beautiful yet frumpy-ish garment into a well-fitting dress that I could feel confident in wearing again. \n\nNotes:\n-They do have weird hours and days off, so make sure to check!\n-Wear the undergarments that you'll be wearing when you wear the altered piece again\n-Bring cash or check\n-Parking behind the building on the grass\n-I would suggest trying on whatever you have altered there just to make sure, but they did a great job on my dress",

In fact we became wine club members and look forward to coming back for dinner and get our bottle of wine for free!!\n\nAnyone who loves wine or enjoys it needs to go here. It's a wine person heaven. Im actually a beer guy but enjoyed every glass I had. And the different ways to enjoy it were sensational. You can order bottles from the store in front and bring it to the table. You can order a flight which is 4 tastings sampler. Order a carafe out of the barrel of their \"seasonal special\". Or just order a classic bottle service or glass. And even show up early and pay only 7$ for wine tasting. The area they hold the wine tasting is full of all kinds of great wine accessories for your wine enthusiasts. \n\nNow for the food, wow everything we were served was supremely delicious, fresh, and cooked to perfection. I highly suggest you ask for the free pretzel bread. Wow so good. The Asian Pork belly tostadas was out of this world appetizer. Made to perfection. I had the Dana's Parmesan Crusted Chicken and it was sensational. The freshness and taste was just exploding out of this meal. And you would think a place with this upscale atmosphere, amazing food and wine, would be well over priced, WRONG!! The prices here were not only fair but comparable to your general restaurant. But the food was hands down a million times better. The wine service amazing. And our waiter made us feel like we were his prestigious guest he provided us with such great service. \n\nSo with all that said there is no reason to go anywhere else when for the comparable price you can eat amazing food, great wine, amazing service, and a beautiful atmosphere and view. \n\nWe are 100% sold on Cooper's hawk and will be back soon and often!!",

  "text": "This place is pure love. By far one of the best options in Nola, away from tourist traps of French quarters yet very much accessible by Uber. \nThis was highly recommended by a friend and it totally exceeded our expectations. The vibe is very hippie and its a self service kind of place so might get a bit confused initially figuring out how it works. The bar tender was pretty helpful though a bit cheeky, guess was trying to fit with the vibe of the place so we didn't mind that at all. We chose to sit outdoors in their backyard over some live music and under the warm toasty sun. I dig such cozy set ups, enough to win me over.\nWe ordered an olive tapenade sandwich and wines to start with. I can say very confidently that each and every ingredient is freshly sourced and carefully selected. You can taste the freshness in every bite, their portion size is also generous but then hey it's Nola. \nThe afternoon was so enjoyable that we kept the wine coming and decided to go next for the cheese platter. For that you need to go to their wine shop in the front, pick your own cheese and pay at the counter. They charge u extra for the cheese plating. Do not regret coz they do an awesome job; you get cheese along with generous portion of bread slices, jelly, mustard sauce, sweet pecans, olives and pickled beans. \nDon't miss out on the cheese platter, it's worth every penny.\nWe loved our afternoon spent at this wonderful place. They are doing it right coz it pays to be different.",

For the most part I have never been mislead by Yelpers but I have to say as far as the Charbroiled Oysters are concerned....I don't get it!  My buddy and I agreed, \"they are just okay\".  Admittedly, maybe we just are not oyster people but seriously we just didn't get what all the fuss is about.\n\nOkay, now that I have gotten that off my chest, I absolutely loved my entree!!!  I ordered the Charbroiled Lobster with Spinach Risotto.  I'm not really a lobster person.  I find it to be a lot of work for a little bit of pay off.  However, this lobster gave me a huge return on my investment!  Every bite was delectable!  The spinach risotto wasn't exactly \"real risotto\".  It was more like rice with spinach and sausage.  Even though it wasn't what I was expecting, it still was delicious and I cleaned my bowl.  Lastly, the service here is incredible.  After this meal, I walked back to my room, climbed into bed and had a peaceful rest with dreams about buttery charbroiled crustaceans.  I will definitely be back!",

Why are you so heavy-laden with carbohydrates that I must avoid you most of the year? Why, is it that I let my guard down at Raddichio and consume you until I wipe my plate clean? Why??\n\nEven crowded on Monday nights (a tell-tale sign that this place is not only good, it's popular), this cute corner BYOB is a neighborhood staple and along with La Locanda (a couple blocks over), it's a solid go-to choice for local italian BYO around Old City.  \n\nDinner progression goes like this: crusty bread, complimentary fresh bruschetta to start.  Wicked garlicky goodness of mussels followed by a favorite of mine, Penne Toto, that is liberally doused with mouth-watering prosciutto, shallots and a pink vodka cream sauce.  Get in my belly!  All their seafood is good here too, and the fish of the day is always fresh and well-prepared.  \n\nService is fast, sometimes rushed and a little impersonal.  Menu consists of good, standard Italian dishes except the Scallops Al Radicchio -  which are bland and the scallops are almost invisible (more white beans than anything) - skip it - and try their calamari instead.  Also, appears like frequent patrons (or family and friends of the owner?) get preferential seating and even reservations - even though the restaurant does not offer them.  I guess if you show up here in a Porsche or a Corvette Stingray, it guarantees you the first and best table in the joint.",

  "text": "I'm surprised at all the negative reviews, Stock Rittenhouse is definitely at the top of my go-to work lunch spots Iist.\n\nHere's what it's not: a cheap authentic Vietnamese place with $5 banh mis or $6 pho. If that's what you're looking for you're gonna have to walk down to Chinatown or Washington Ave. I'd love to do that too, but it's too far to walk for lunch on a work day.\n\nHere's what it is: a place you can take a coworker that's maybe never had Burmese noodles or a Thai crispy rice salad or Cambodian pork dip that you can be in and out within an hour and pay $12 for a decent amount of food that you can even pack up half of for a snack later or lunch the next day if you have any self control (I don't). The flavors are not too crazy or spicy or authentic but they're better than it's predecessor wokworks or a place like honeygrow. \n\nFood:\n\nThe options are more interesting than your typical Asian fast casual concept, there are herbs and toppings and things you've never heard of, but then there are simple things like a chicken pho (which they call a good deal soup for some reason), peanut noodles, and banh mis. Some of the other options are a curry soup (very good and going to be my go to in the winter), Curry noodles (really liked these), Burmese noodles (liked them at first but then got a bit tired of the flavor- lots of picked things), Thai crispy rice salad (good and actually spicy), Cambodian pork dip (this is an app and was very good, and would be big enough for a meal). The dishes aren't as customizable as wok works or honeygrow where you choose a sauce, topping, veggies and everything, here you just choose a protein ( tofu, seitan, grilled chicken, fried chicken, pork (+$1), and shrimp (+$3)). The fried chicken and grilled chicken are both really good.\n\nThe set up is pretty much the same as wok works was: order at the counter, choose a protein and type of food, they have some sort of rewards system you can link your card to, serve yourself complimentary water and grab your chopsticks/cutlery/napkins/ hot sauce, sit down at tables very close to others, they bring out your food, you bus your own table.\n\nHoping they add some hot noodle dishes for the winter, and looking forward to trying all their options!",

Seeing that it was new years weekend and we hadn't made a reservation, we were told that there would be a 60-70 minute wait. The bar was PACKED and we wouldn't have been able to sit down and enjoy a drink while we waited so we walked across the street and got a round at the Carousel Bar. We returned 45 minutes later and were told that they had already called for our table and that the restaurant was closing so they would \"see what they could do.\" \n\nEnding up sitting at the bar which was actually a good thing because we didn't feel obligated to over order.  We were there specifically for the BBQ shrimp (their signature dish) and were were not let down! We were given bibs because the jumbo shrimp (with their heads still on) were served in a big bowl, sitting atop at least two inches of a peppery, butter sauce. It also came with french bread for dipping.  Trust me, it was GOOOOD stuff!  \n\n I am always a sucker for jumbo sea scallops so we had an order of those as well. They were served with a spicy,  watercress salad drizzled with white truffle oil and shaved parmesan reggiano.  Also delicious!!! \n\nThe restaurant itself is beautiful and only added to my new found love of the city.",

Passed by Little Greek and decided to hit a quick u-turn to try it out.\n\nI'm huge on customer service and theirs was great from the jump. The girl working the front asked us if we had been in before, we let her know we hadn't, and she went through the menu. She let us know that they were out of 100% lamb but their Gyro meat (90% beef, 10% lamb) was good. I think she noticed under my mask that I was a little suspect of it being \"good\" and offered me to try a piece. It was delish and had she not told me, I would've thought it was 100% lamb; appreciate the honesty! \n\nI ordered the Greek Salad with Gyro meat and the BF ordered the Steak-Skewer dinner. Both of us were impressed with our meals. I loved the potato salad on the salad and their Greek dressing paired very well. My BF loved the rice on his salad and said the steak was \"flavorful.\" The side of warm pita bread was good too and was shocked my boyfriend ate it too as that's usually not his thing. \n\nWe ended up eating our food there and the manager periodically checked on us, which was a nice touch.

  "text": "*****Zahav, Zahav, Zahav. Feels Like a Migos Song or Something*****\n\nFOOD\nSalatim: Don't sleep on the cabbage. The Beets are an older fave than even The Beats on Doug (killer tofu, anyone?), but the cabbage was my favorite.\n\nHummus and Bread: the SINGLE GREATEST DISH I have ever eaten in the United States! Thank you, Based Zahav. Someday, I will treat myself to an AYCE hummus sesh at the bar. For reference, went to Dizengoff for lunch, and this completely blew it away (which is no stab at Dizengoff). Bread is one my favorite foods and it doesn't get better than Zahav's laffa folks.\n\nMezze:\nDuck Hearts: a classic favorite. Salty even by Zahav standards but the muscle is exquisite.\nSable: On a previous visit, I found this dish \"inspirational.\" This rendition gave a more \"uplifting\" vibe. From the bread, to the egg, to the delicate fish, the dish gets increasingly lighter, providing a fresh, enlivening energy.\nKibbe: another old favorite\nHaloumi: Classic dish but this is the best rendition I have had (dat date sauce doh). Gotta get multiple orders when sharing with a big group.\nCauliflower: A Zahav staple. Highly recommended for first timers. \nCrispy Grave Leaves: these were great, but not my favorite among the mezze\nCobia Crudo: If you could make a mini pizza out of fish, this would be it. Nice spicy sauce complements the raw fish well. Recommended for the adventurous\n\nAl Ha'esh\nCrimini Mushrooms: Very good but not the best I've ever had. \nBranzino: Also exquisite but portion could have been a little larger (~4 small bites).\nLamb Merguez: mmm mmm good.\nBeef and Lamb Kofte: see lamb merguez\nRice: Would have liked to see a slightly bigger portion, not because I had room for it, but just because its rice. I'm just really looking for reasons to criticize, at this point...Please bring the Ribeye back, Zahav!!! \n\nDessert: true sleeper of the meal. Wasn't expecting this as a strength but Zahav is still #zahav. Wasn't a huge fan of the complexity and sourness of the sourbet but it was a hit at the table. Ice cream sandwich was small (cut into 3 pieces) but delicious. Chocolate mousse had the most decadent cream. Kataifi had a great variety of texture and I felt one of the largest portions.\n\nSERVICE: It's like they secretly slip a magnet in your food that repels you from the staff when you walk around the restaurant. If you are sitting on the open end of a table, good luck trying to make it to the restroom and back before your napkin is neatly folded. Same goes for seeing the bottom of the water glass, quite impressive given the massive quantities of water necessary with a neverending rather salty feast at the table. Service would seem over the top if they couldn't pull it off, but boy do they pull it off. \n\nPLAYLIST ANALYSIS: Up to this point we're at six stars. Zahav flexed an upbeat variety, with The Dream to dropping sidetracks from College Dropout (School Spirit) and the Black Album (Lucifer). Even paired Nas and Jay songs with only one song in btwn!! If anyone can pull that off, it's Zahav. But the one moment where things went too far...to my utter shock, I heard Drake (fortunately not while I was enjoying that hummus). I wasn't expecting to hear Meeks weak response to Back to Back, but dropping a sing songy Drake track? TOO SOON, Zahav, TOO SOON.\n\nWEBSITE: Single greatest website music ever. Really want to bump this at my wedding. Until then...link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBuBAOxtLpI\n\nFINAL VERDICT: I can't imagine why anyone besides Jeezy (\"standing at my podium, trying to watch my sodium\") and maybe Meek would not fall in love with Zahav. Get rid of the Drake and I'll consider petitioning Yelp to add a sixth star #zahav",

  "text": "Bravo, bravo! Vision Lofts was a wonderful place for my coworkers and I to get sh*t done. We had the space to ourselves for our annual planning summit and while there were only about 10 of us, you could definitely host an epic party of just about any kind, in this lovely space. My brain went wild thinking of fun things to do here. \n\nIt was big and open, had tons of natural light, the bathrooms were clean and fabulous, I loved the plant wall towards the back, they had coffee available all throughout the day and heck, there was even a fireplace! We spent the majority of our time in the center of the building watching presentations, but they even had couches and cozy corners scattered around. When we needed go get up to stretch our legs, we could! Additionally, the staff was really helpful when need be, and they had tons of televisions around. \n\nOverall, they went above and beyond to make our group feel welcome. I'd highly recommend.",

I told him what I needed & that I didn't have much time, then off he went to get me a few dresses that fit the style I was looking for.  \n\nThere was a lot to choose from, but I didn't fall in love with any particular dress.

  "text": "I crave burritos on a regular basis and it seems that Chipotle is the best Nashville has yet to offer up to burrito lovers. It's sad to be honest. Chipotle will never have burritos that will compare to my personal favorite of nopales and tofu rancheros from my local taquaria in San Francisco. But its what happens when you move away from the source. If there are some veg friendly places I am overlooking, please drop some knowledge on this transplant.\n\nThis is your standard Chipotle. If you like Chipotle in general, you will like this one. I work across the street and this is the best vegan option for my long days on campus. I tend to burrito here frequently (burrito is a verb here). \n\nIf you don't like Chipotle, you won't like this one either.\n\nI find that Chipotle is a fix, but is not quite fully satisfying. It's like when you really want to have a satisfying beer and there is only light beer. Yeah, you will drink it, but it's no IPA. It serves it's purpose well.",

Burgers, fries, shakes and hot dogs. \n\nPersonally I love me a good old fashioned burger and it looked like they had a burger that looked like a big Mac if that's your thing! \n\nI went plain jane today. A naked frank. An angus beef hot dog sliced open and grilled, on a plain bun. Hey, don't judge, it takes me back to childhood alright?? I know I asked for a naked hotdog, but they toasted the bun and it made it much drier than if they had not. \n\nOnion petals. Think of.onion rings but just a different shape. They come with a dipping sauce i can't quite describe other than its called the \"clancy sauce.\"  It was white and almost looked like tartar sauce but it definitely wasn't. It was chilled and thick, a bit tangy. Was good for dipping the onion petals, but I would be curious if their famous cheese sauce wasn't even better. \nCrinkle cut fries, single burgers with the option to double up the party for an extra $3 and chili cheese fries. I'll be back to try everything.",

He was about 20 minutes late, but they didn't mind.\n\nWe got a bottle of red wine along with dinner. For the appetizer, I ordered a mozzarella with Italian meat. I was expecting something like prosciutto, but it was disappointing... I'd liken it to plain ham from the deli. My friends were happy with their butternut squash soup and beet salad, though. We all had the filet mignon for our entree and everyone was wowed. All conversation stopped because we were too busy eating! It was definitely one of the best steaks I've ever had.\n\nFor dessert, I ordered chocolate bread pudding and tasted my friend's blood orange sherbet. Both were phenomenal as well. \n\nThe food was amazing, the servers and hosts were super friendly, and I really like the atmosphere.

I split the Prime Burger with my husband and it was like ridiculously good! Worth the splurge. So juicy and flavorful!

I love that they don't just have great burgers they also focus on the non burger stuff. All the salads we saw going by our table look great!! We also saw a very delicious looking dessert which our server said was a milkshake with Makers Mark drizzled on top...wish we had more room!

  "text": "Had a nice little solo dinner at the bar here. I, unlike some of the other reviewers, did not come here expecting Mexico's finest cuisine. It's pretty standard Americanized Mexican fare. \n\nAlways love the frozen margaritas here, no matter what size you get they are pretty strong. (Try to get them on happy hour tho for the best price.) \n\nI had a shrimp, spinach and cheese quesadilla. I enjoyed it, but be cautioned that it's pretty small and you'll likely need a side to feel full. I also didn't like that they used these baby shrimp in them that seemed like they were a tad bit over cooked. However, if you drown anything in cheese it'll taste good and this was no exception. \n\nThe service was friendly. It was pretty crowded so it wasn't as quick as it usually is here, but that's fine. What wasn't fine was that I didn't get my complementary chips and salsa. \n\nWhat I like most about this location is that the bar area is pretty huge. There are lots of high tops, bar seating and standing room  near the bar which makes it ideal for sporting events or just a night out at the bar. \n\nOverall a chill place to come eat and drink. I'll be back I'm sure.",

  "text": "WOW.  Just...wow.\n\nI've been in the vicinity of The Black Pearl restaurant before during somewhat drunken girls nights at Kelly's/Chicka Boom Room/Blur next door and have always made a mental note to try TBP sometime.  However, I seemed to have forgotten about it during our millions of \"what do you want to do for dinner tonight\" conversations with the hubs.  We got on Yelp last night and tried to find a new place, saw all the rave reviews for TBP and opted to try it.\n\nWalking into TBP, I had to giggle a little.  It reminded me of a dozen \"chic\" Hampton clubs circa the 1980's.  The decor is done in black/grey with very modern, angular statues of posed women (If you were a young adult in the 80's, you know the kind I mean) and peppered with pops of color here and there. They have a bunch of mismatched dinnerware in a china cabinet at the back of the restaurant that they serve with. It's so funky and cool and I loved the eclectic mix of dinnerware.  Tres cool.   Music runs the gamut from Frank Sinatra to funky 70's jams and acoustic versions of modern tunes.  All this lends to the atmosphere and is absolutely a pre-cursor to the meal you are about to eat.\n\nWhen you can have duck pate, escargot and foie gras on the same menu as fried green tomatoes and pork bellies?  You have something truly special.  These are comfort foods done elegantly and elegant foods done homey.  It's an interesting juxtaposition. \n\nWe started with appetizers of fried green tomatoes for me and the pork bellies for my hubby.  The FGT were breaded and had crab meat between the layers.  Delicious sauces accompany it.  It was yummy.  But, I need to focus on my husbands pork bellies.  INSANE.  Tom, our server, who was incredibly delightful, described it to us as \"meat candy\" and I kid you not, those words are the perfect articulation of what this appy tasted like.  These bellies are succulent, flavored in a maple type sauce, sitting on little beds of grated white cheese.  It's not always on the menu, but Tom informed us that if you call in advance and request it, the chef will be happy to make it for you.  My husband referred to it as a \"panty dropper for your mouth\".  LOL  This was followed by a delicious house salad with a stunning raspberry dressing.  Heinously delish.\n\nFor our main course, my husband had the veal paillards (translates to pounded meat.  Heh.)  It was made with a vanilla bean sauce, shiitake and crimini mushrooms and sweet marsala wine.  Served with a little muffin looking thingy that turned out to be spaghetti squash.  Tasted like a ball of stuffing. It was just a little mouthful, but left you wanting more!  A few stalks of asparagus, perfectly cooked. Warm layer of mashed potatoes.  I don't care for veal, but this was delicious.  For my meal, I opted for the twice cooked Long Island duckling.  Now, understand, I do not like duck.  The meat is generally too dark for me and it's just not something I usually enjoy.  However, something in the description of the menu drew me to it.  It was a semi-boneless leg, slowly braised, and the breast is grilled with a cranberry apple demiglace.  It just sounded like it would be so sweet and succulent and that is EXACTLY what it was.  My husband tasted it and his eyes literally rolled back in his skull and made a noise that is usually only reserved for our um...\"private time\", which does not include ducks (usually?) or farm animals of any kind for that matter.  I kind of choked on my duck meat watching him react that way and I admit, I think I might have been a tad jealous of the duck.  Um, hello?  That reaction is supposed to be on reserve for MY breast meat.  Hmph.  So, now...I was more than happy to eat this duck that was trying to steal my man.  Make my husband moan with delight? Not on MY watch, Duck!  Back off or I will EAT you!  (and did...happily!)\n\nDessert: Bananas foster for him and a creme brulee for me.  However, they are well known for a signature dessert called \"Tarte Tatin\", which is required to be ordered when you order your meal as it takes some extra time to create.  It is granny smith apples cooked in butter, brown sugar and spices,  topped with puff pastry and fresh whipped cream.  They also have their own signature black licorice ice cream.  I think my husband and I moaned and groaned through the entire meal so much, we probably sounded like a bad 70's porno.  I am usually a kind of classy chick when I am dressed up, out and about.  But, poor Tom made the mistake of asking how everything was and I, caught off guard and still reeling in the afterglow of this sexy meal came out with \"I wish I brought a change of underwear\".\n\nYeah.  Classy chick.  Thankfully, Tom took it in stride. \n\nThe meal came out to about $160 for two, without gratuity, and with only one glass of wine each, but well worth every penny.  Since hubs is determined to try \"everything on the menu\", we will definitely be back.\n\nI hope they Scotchgard™ the chairs, you know...just in case.",

Anyways, several options were given to me for dinner. The menu and reviews here stood out to me. So it's located on the same floor as Bok. We had a nice rooftop view. The interior was elegant and relaxing, as well. Cocktails were light and refreshing. Perfect balance of alcohol, sour, and sweet. We got the carrot fritters, which were amazing. Crisp exterior without too much breading on the interior. The haloumi dukka was amazing. I love cheese, and this was well made. The dates and nuts added great contrast to the tenderness of the cheese. We grabbed the manti, which were tiny little beef filled dumplings. The chili oil served with it wasn't overbearingly spicy. The lamb kofta was cooked well. So much flavor to the meatballs and the sauce. Great food and ambiance.",

Bonus, this one wasn't overly crowded when I went to it, and had a fair amount of inside and outside seating.  The mac and cheese side is legit, but I found the baked beans to just be average.

I had a Lexus a few cars ago and absolutely love their service department, it is top notch. Unfortunately in the two months since I purchased my car I have become the Duke of their service department. \nI purchased my auto at night , it was a certified 2 year old auto so I wasn't too thorough examining the car. The next day I was examining the NX in the daylight and noticed some serious damage to the front of the vehicle. Someone hit a curb and the front spoiler was severely damaged as well as the front air dam. They replaced the parts but it took 3 visits, the first time they thought they could touch it up , then the second time they fixed one of two damaged pieces. The third time was a charm and they have a happy customer. \nI can't imagine that they were aware of this damage as it was definitely over $1,000 to fix and nobody would buy a certified vehicle with that amount of damage. I am thinking a lot attendant or salesmen hit a curb and didn't report it.\nIt worked out for me and I was impressed with service department.",

  "text": "I've had this place bookmarked for a while, so I was excited to be in the area around lunch time today to finally get to try it. The truck sits back from the street so it's easy to miss if you haven't seen it before. There is a small seating area out front on a wooden deck with a few chairs and a couple of benches. It's obviously more of a waiting area than an eating area. \n\nThe gentleman who helped me order was very courteous and helpful with my food selections. I could see the cook behind him grilling delicious smelling meats and another worker preparing food. Everything looked clean (it is out of a truck with the doors open in Florida) and the workers were wearing gloves. I was really happy with the service. \n\nOk on to the food - I ordered a ceviche tostada, fish U.S. Taco, and horchata. After living in California for three years, my bar for Mexican food has been set unbearably high. This is not always a good thing, because it's hard to enjoy new places when you had the best for so long. Everything I tried from this truck was amazing. I ate the taco first and the flavors individually stood out to me - the grilled fish, the fresh tomatoes and cilantro, the perfectly warmed corn tortilla. Everything about it was satisfying. On to the tostada - I'm so picky with ceviche. I make it at home all the time so it's hard to eat it out. As soon as I took the first bite, I knew this would be the item that would bring me back again and again. The lime taste was subtle, not overpowering like it can get if too much is added, the fish very fresh tasting, and then all the other flavors came through like the fresh cilantro and onion, and the crispy shell underneath. It was topped with a generous  amount of perfectly ripe avocado. Absolutely perfect. So last but not least, the horchata! After trying several attempts of horchata in Tampa I gave up. I decided to give it a try here and I'm happy I did. It wasn't overly sweet or thick like I've experienced lately, instead just the right amount of flavor and really refreshing. \n\nSo overall, I can't wait to come back and get some more authentic Spanish food, especially the ceviche. Don't let the outside deter you, it's worth the stop.",

I'm constantly on the lookout for new and fun stuff to try and I can always appreciate the nice employees.",

  "text": "Came here based on several of my (trusted) friend's reviews.  I'm a little bit of a sushi snob since Samurai blue was the very first place I ever had sushi- so, where do you go from there?   But, I was definitely impressed with Matoi.\n\nThe waitstaff was extraordinarily peppy and friendly- and I love that each table has a \"call\" button you can push when you need your waitress.  There was a great assortment of specialty rolls- plenty of fried and unhealthy options (my favorite).  And a lot that had cream cheese (my second favorite).  \n\nI opted for the Bucs roll and i was not disappointed! I also had a ginger salad, which I inhaled as well.  \n\nMy lunch companion was equally as pleased with his meal...and he is very picky when it comes to restaurants.  So, a win win for everyone.",

  "text": "Yee haw!  This place is really, really awesome!   I could seriously go back and spend another couple of hours there.\n\nFirst off, the building is beautiful.  I enjoyed just walking around the outside taking pictures.  Second, it's well curated.  So many interesting facts along with historic video of classic country and rock n roll pioneers.  The collection of memorabilia is astounding.\nThird, it's very interactive.  I loved the \"Nashville Cats\" exhibit which talked about Bob Dylan and a lot of the musicians in Nashville.  Listening to musicians and their influences, along with selections from songwriters and session musicians was really an immersive experience.\n\nBest of all, they have the Trans Am from \"Smokey and the Bandit II\".   Makes me want to go date Sally Field, seeing that!\n\nThe Hall of Fame section is great too.  The design is wonderful and it's great to see.\n\nI'm not a huge country music fan but after coming here, I realize Nashville is about more than that.  I think the city inspires creativity and I have a better understanding of why singers, songwriters and musicians from around the world would come here.  Really, really outstanding place.  \n\nPro tip: If you go in the side entrance on 5th Avenue, the ticket line there is usually much smaller than the one in the main lobby facing Demonbreun Street.\n\nOnly reason it's not five stars is that it gets a little crowded and it's hard to see some of the exhibits and some of the interactive stations didn't work.  If you're going to make it interactive, you need to make sure the stuff works.",

  "text": "Redemption. The awful hosting ability--we waited for anyone to acknowledge us forever--was bettered by the immediate presentation of warm flat bread, hummus, fresh \"Tza-tzi-ki\" and Mythos beer.\n\nDays could and should be spent addressing the decor!  Somewhere, the staging of an ancient tragedy is missing a few colum-esque props and the baroque glitter and gold of some of the venu's accoutrements clashes--80's clothing style--with the faux elegance of the painted-brick-fountain nook.  It was Greek, way outside of Greece, without an assigned century and with no sense of synthesis.  I was thrilled from the get go!\n\nAnd then there was Heidi the waitress.  Her absolute nonchalance, her in your face charisma, her slightly iffy charm.  I couldn't have loved her more.  At one point she walked away from the table in front of me, smile on her face, stopped at my elbow, leaned against my shoulder, hand on my arm and said \"what do you think that is?\" \n\nI looked over and saw that a woman in the adjacent group was wearing a full on stuffed sheep bib.  Huge.  Appalling.  To Heidi, the epitome of distraction.  She couldn't contain that as she served the table she thought they could all tell that she, while addressing the group, could not take her eyes off of the sheep bib.  \n\n\"I just wanna talk to it, y'know?  Ask it,\" she said, \"if it needs anything else?\"  \n\nShe was completely dead pan, not in any way unserious, and concerned.  I almost peed my (heavily complimented) shorts.\n\nAnd the foodohmygod. I indulged in the Pastitio; a layered greek pasta that hinted at nutmeg and elevated the warm cheese (ricotta, if I'm not mistaken) to flight.  It melted in the right way, like a full bodied cloved wine.  It was gorgeous.  The rice was indescribable.  It was a little overcooked, but the flavor compensated for the little-bit-too-fluffiness of the texture.  The cucumbers and carrots and flatbread triangles, drizzled in the light oil and vinegar house made Greek dressing...I could hit the character limit talking about the dance of dazzling tastes.\n\nGustavo ordered a sampler platter of sorts complete with lamb and gyro skewers. The spices popped, the sugars glazed, this marinaded meat got me trouble. I kept just picking off of his plate.  And picking.  Picking, just a little bit more.  One hand slap and some sharp admonition later...well, we have leftovers now.\n\nI also ordered the spanikopata to go (a few bites didn't quite make it home intact) and it was filo dough deliciousness.  And a sweet-treat for later tomorrow of raspberry white cheese cake.  One bite told me yes, Gustavo said the sauce was a little bit to fruit out of a jar.  True story, but then get it on the side--the cake is the real ticket.\n\nOh, and we started with the grape leaves.  Can anyone say yesplease and thankyouIwantmore?  Mmmmm.\n\nTotal bill for the homemade humus and cucumber dip, 5 Mythos, Pastitio, Skewer platter, spanikopata and desert?  $66.00.  That's five courses and a heck of a lot of beer.  Enjoy it friends, I know I will be.  \n\n--Fairy Food Father\n\nPostscript:  The cascading drape/glass lights.  You have to see the interior to believe it.  It is sublime in it's confusion--It almost makes a sound--like the discordant notes of a pantheon of plural at-odds deities.",

I don't even care if my grandma says it's not my favorite. If she does, she's toast. \n\nI'm sorry, I get passionate about Thai food because I love it so much. Anyway, let's get to the WHY. \n\nLet's start where all good Thai meals begin: with Thai tea and spring rolls. The Thai tea was pretty good and they were happy to sub milk for coconut milk for my vegan wife. The springs rolls were off the chain. Very crispy and not too greasy. \n\nThe main course was the highlight. My first time at any Thai place usually involves me getting a staple: pad Thai. This pad Thai was memorable. There was a lot of good size pieces of chicken and it was nice and tender, not dried out like it tends to be with most Thai places. The flavor was on point as well. \n\nAnother plus was that they have a whole separate vegetarian menu making this place an awesome spot for anyone with a restrictive diet.",

  "text": "A seriously elegant evening at one of the Tampa Bay area's newest restaurants. Cooper's Hawk Winery & Restaurant is both a surprisingly-good winery and a fine-dining establishment located near International Plaza.\n\nYou'll find Cooper's Hawk in the same little shopping plaza as the Kona Grill, Texas de Brazil, and E*Trade, along Boy Scout Road. The three restaurants all offer complimentary valet parking which is a great idea since the available spaces out front fill up very quickly.\n\nYou enter Cooper's Hawk through their beautifully-appointed tasting room, where the staff hands you a complimentary glass of one of their wines and invites you to look around and ask questions while waiting on your reservation. You'll find a large number of options for tasting their white, red, and sweet wines. This is a terrific place to learn about wine, and order a \"tasting\" of 7 or 8 different types of wine to enjoy with a cheese plate or a dessert from the bakery case.\n\nIf you prefer a sit-down dinner you have two options -- the lounge area is more casual with TV screens, and you have the choice of a high-top table, small booth along the back wall, or seating right at the bar. I'm told that you can order the full menu from the lounge.\n\nMy preference is the main dining room where you'll be surrounded by large oak barrels used for aging the wine. The feeling is very much like a private dining area in an exclusive wine cellar, an Cooper's Hawk pulls this off flawlessly.\n\nMy extremely lovely date and I ordered some wine with our dinner - a bottle of the incredible Sangiovese Merlot, and we spent a few moments acting like total wine snobs as we swirled the wine in our glasses and just enjoyed the delicious bouquet.\n\nFor my dinner I started with the highly recommended Crab & Lobster Bisque which is as good as any seafood bisque that I've ever eaten. Bold flavors with big chunks of seafood, and finished with a touch of sherry. To that I added the Cooper's Hawk Farm Grill which was a Bleu Cheese-crusted beef tenderloin medallion, a maple, mustard, and pretzel-crusted pork tenderloin medallion, and a Parmesan-crusted lamb chop. This trio of meats was served with grilled asparagus and the house special mashed potatoes   OINK!!!!!\n\nThe waitress smiled when we declined dessert and coffee, and instead brought us a small plate of assorted chocolate-covered strawberries as a little something. (I think this was my Thank you gift for joining their Red Wine Club which will insure that I continue coming back on a regular basis). Regardless, the dinner was so incredibly perfect.\n\nWhen the bill came I was totally stunned at the price. This was a very high-quality meal of the same caliber as Bern's Steakhouse for considerably less money.\n\nOh yes my friends.......an elegant evening, and we will be back for more!",

  "text": "I came here for restaurant week and my experience was ok.\n\nI didn't fall in love with the food here. Everything was pretty average. \n\nMy favorite part of the entire meal was probably the complimentary fresh biscuits. Soft, moist and delectable warm fresh biscuits with a honey butter to pair with -- it was a perfect combination of savory and sweet to start my meal off with. After that, it went on a downward slope. For appetizers: The butternut squash soup was pretty good but comparable to any other vegetable soup from other restaurants. The crab cake was delicious. My partner and I both ordered the 8 oz filet and mashed potatoes for our main entree. It was nice and red on the inside, but the outside was dry and over cooked. There wasn't much flavor to it, nor was it juicy enough. The waitress notified me that's how the kitchen makes their medium rare steaks -- very red on the inside but dark on the outside. I can see why people compare the steaks here to an Outback Steakhouse steak. For dessert, we ordered the lemon tart and blood orange sorbet. Both were extremely sour and tart as expected. I was a little underwhelmed by the blood orange sorbet. It was 3 tiny balls in a glass. \n\nThe atmosphere here is very unique. Definitely an old Hollywood vibe with super dim lighting. Comfortable seating all around. \n\nAlthough the food was pretty mediocre, the service was great. I had multiple people check up on me, consistently fill my water and overall very friendly service. Very quick too -- the courses came out in perfect timing, it was as if there were constant eyes to see when we finished the last bite of each dish.",

  "text": "I lived at The Lakes Bellevue for exactly two years. I only moved because I'm now attending school out of state. If I were still living in Nashville and had to renew my lease, I'm not sure I would. However, I realize that my concerns are probably out of the control of the property manager.\n\nI can't believe I'm saying that I was fortunate for this situation, but I was indeed fortunate that I had an​ infestation of millipedes​ just two weeks before I moved. But it was an annoying two weeks of having pest control come over twice and the millipedes​ didn't entirely disappear after that. It's just odd because I never had problems with pests at this apartment before this incident. I actually feel bad for the tenant who is moving into my unit after me.\n\nLiving on the second floor, I've had to listen to a fair share of upstairs neighbors' footsteps throughout my two years of living in the same unit. The walls of my apartment shook, too, if my upstairs neighbors' footsteps were heavy enough. I understand this is dependent on how heavy your upstairs neighbors' footsteps are and I'm sure the majority of apartments are like this, but I do wish my apartment was more sound- and shake-proof.\n\nDespite my concerns, there are positives. For instance, this a great price in the Nashville housing market. You get what you pay for.\n\nI love the gym, although, you'd probably want a gym membership if you want more advanced equipment.\n\nThere are not only three scenic lakes but also three pools. Yes, there are geese, but the groundskeepers actually do an excellent job at spraying away geese poop. You may be lucky to have your apartment look over​ one of the lakes, but I preferred my apartment overlooking​ the foresty, green hills of the property. They even have a five-mile hiking trail, which I feel like not even the current residents know about, and I wish there was a trail map of.\n\nEverything is renovated from the leasing office to the majority of the units. The property is obviously much older than the renovations​, which you can tell by the exterior of the buildings. But the interiors are beautiful.",

Not sure exactly how the fuzzy navel was supposed to taste but it was rather bland. Luckily the s'mores was amazing and filled me up with the ooooey gooooey marshmellow filling.\n\nI love the dinosaur accents around the place.
