  "text": "Overall, I like the options that LA offers. All the classes, racquetball.. etc. It's great in that regard. The downfall is this place is dirty and the machines are not well maintained. You can smell the dirty carpet and whatever funk they have growing in the corners as soon as you walk in. They really need a cleaning company to come in there, shampoo the carpets and sanitize that place. Also, some of your elliptical look like they're on their last leg! Rusty and literally falling apart. Come on guys. This is a great gym. Clean and maintain it!!",

Read the fine print. \n\nOne day I had completed a workout and got into the locker room only to find that they had plumbers just started working on both showers after a class in November. They could have had them work on only one shower at a time or wait until after everyone had left the locker room. \n\nAlmost impossible to understand the instructions over the loud music. If you are new or don't attend regularly, you may be completely lost. \n\nPros: very clean studio and great workout. Easy attached parking. \n\nNOTE: BB studios must be independently owned. Pricing is different depending on location and you can't share passes between studios.",

I must say, first time I tried power sculpt I thought I was going to die.. Had to build up my strength for sure to ease into this class but now it's my favorite.  It's definitely most intense of them all and least like yoga so if you want more traditional yoga try the hot power fusion or C2. I love the music, the facility is beautiful and I like this studio because it's not as crowded as the downtown one and parking is much better.",

  "text": "Ok, so as far as the classes, the cleanliness, the amenities - five star. \n\nHowever, they get 2 stars from me for everything else. I clicked on a link for a promotion on FB - 30 day challenge! How exciting! I needed the accountability and support. I spoke with Mandi, who encouraged me, offered me a first class free, and really kept on me about getting me in and started. All good. I paid the $149. First red flag, she had always wrote me back promptly (text message), but when I saw on my account that there was an auto monthly renewal- I wrote back and heard nothing for over a day. I went in for my next ride, and spoke to someone else about this being a one month promotion. \n\nThere is NO benefit to the one month challenge that I paid $149 for only to see the price go down to $99 within a few days. I asked for the remainder to be credited to another month and was told no. Not only told no, but that girl never spoke to me again - even in passing. There are no extra perks- I was told there was a Nutrionist coming to speak - she came, but just set up a table and advertised her products. Nothing extra for the challengers - I never met another challenger. I wasn't encouraged to keep coming and I actually stopped. It's just a marketing ploy - I was bamboozled. I wouldn't encourage anyone curious to try the challenge - you can just pay the $99/month and follow their social media for all the happenings. I don't blame Mandi at all - I'm sure the promotion came from corporate- just sharing my experience.",

  "text": "Tough to get equipment, especially the free motion, around 5:30 during the weekday. Cardio is readily available as long as you do not want the one working rower!  There us a membership fee in addition to the monthly rate. My experience is these membership fee went out of favor in this industry in the 90's. I have not paid a membership fee at Quadrum, Anytime Fitness nor Planet Fitness and LA is part of my health insurance discount plan. Go figure. I do like that classes are included and not an extra. This makes the membership fee a little more palatable. Still have to check out the classes. Personal trainers are good, supportive, knowledgeable and challenging. The personal training rate is higher than I've paid at Retro fitness in NJ or Anytime Fitness in Florida. Those rates were $35/30 mins with discount to $25-30 with more sessions purchased. At LA, it starts at $40/30 mins and goes up from there. Unlike the newer LA Fitnesses in the area this one does not have a pool or courts.   It is close to home with ample parking, including a parking garage. Gym is located on second floor. Elevators are available. They have also renewed motivation in my daughter and I see that as a real plus. There is also childcare available.",

  "text": "I love working out at this gym!\n\n I've have had wonderful experiences with my trainers at City Fitness, Rittenhouse. I've been a member of the gym for over 2 years and I've had a personal trainer for about 8 or 9 months. They've changed the way I work out completely. The program is called \"Thrive\", and I've done just that. I'm able to work out on my own and am confident knowing what muscle groups to focus on and which set comes first to get the most out of my workouts. I train with Allissa H., and she's wonderful. I'll tell her exactly what I need and she tailors my workouts to fit those needs (she's rather easy on the eyes and that helps too). I work very well with a schedule, and sometimes I need to cancel due to other priorities. Allissa has never treated me as if I was a floating client and she always fits me into her schedule. She has never cancelled on me and she is always on time. You do workouts in a small group, with your trainer walking you through each set of workouts. There is a definite method to the madness. Stretching and warm up are followed by power, and then two sets of strength training. The trainers are all very friendly. They always smile and say hello when I pass them; as if we were friends or I was previously a client. Alas, it's always a great experience here. This is why I probably go every day.",

But I don't ever really have a problem getting a rack.\n\nEvery LA fitness tends to hide the locker room, this one is no exception. The showers could use an overhaul. I'm never sure if the soap on the wall has been tampered with because the caps are always off.\n\nOtherwise, it's a decent gym and it's not Planet Fitness. I like going here for the price.

The photos above are a true but small representation of the deplorable conditions of the showers, toilets, and stalls. I will be buying out my contract. I went through FVH because they let me use my credit card for monthly dues where other locations will not. Because I live in between FVH and Edwardsville, I figured I'd use both locations. No way.  Going back to Gold's. I belonged go FVH when they first opened. Now, you're lucky to find staff at the front desk and if you do, they're munching on their fast food or chatting up their friends. They probably should be cleaning this disgusting excuse for a gym. What's worse is that a letter to corporate results in a basic form letter response. I'll happily pay more and go to a gym where I won't contract a mega virus from stepping in the doors. Despicable.",

And never fear, even if you don't know exactly what you want as your goals, she'll take you through various programs until you find the perfect fit to achieve results. I love the personal touch of a unique program built for me, including the meal plans. One of the great things about Natali, I feel she truly has a personal investment in her clients, she wants you to succeed. The 1-on-1 training sessions are great, fun and private so you can focus on learning form and techniques without all the extra distractions of public gym.",

  "text": "UPDATE: Review #2\n\nI can now leg press 500lbs. \n\nMy 12 weeks with Natali have ended. I am going to try things on my own for the next 12 weeks, and then hopefully start again (I am more than willing but she is becoming even busier with clients!)\n\nI have lost some pounds and definitely some inches. I have had some physical and emotional setbacks, so I may have been able to do better, but Natali never once even hinted that she was unhappy with me. She understands that her clients are doing the best they can for that given moment. She is ONLY full on encouragement, positivity and she is darn funny. \n\nI also improved beyond the numbers:\n\n1. I am a lot stronger physically. \n\n2. I am no longer even remotely intimidated by the gym. I'm right next to all the other serious lifters and they are awesome, inclusive people. No one cares about my work out if I am doing my own thing and not impeding someone else. I have the right to be in the gym just like everyone else.\n\n3. I WANT to go to the gym. I WANT to lift heavy (and I mean heavy). I have always loved it but Natali helped me cultivate it more by challenging me. \n\n4. Meal planning gets the job done.\n\n5. I am a beast in the gym. Natali knew it when she met me and she kept challenging me until I figured it out myself. And when I did it changed me.\n\n6. YOU are the deciding factor. Do the work and get the results. Figure out who you are. Natali has your back.\n\nI can now leg press 500lbs. With ease. I know I said it before but I went from lifting 175 to 500 in 12 weeks. \n\nI cannot wait to try it alone for 12 weeks and go back to the teacher after doing my homework.",

So we waited until they finally opened up to do a 3 day trial. But honestly a 3 day trial is nothing they should offer a month free to try it out so u have enough time to try out not only the equipment but the classes as well. we tried 3 days it wasnt enough to decide on commiting for a entire year. i dont like contracts and feel others dont wanna be stuck for a year in a contract because if after a few months if your not happy your gonna be stuck i think they should do away with contracts more people would sign up if it was like that.\n\nThe gym is beautiful inside they have a theater room with bikes and treadmills that is a great edition that other gyms dont offer. Also they have a protein shake bar which is awesome. they offer many flavors to choose from. i did not sign up for the gym but you should give it a try maybe it will fit you. I would like them to offer a free month trial and no contract that would fit my lifestyle better but until then i will continue Planet fitness",

  "text": "I am OBSESSED with OTF after being a member for 1 year. I took the initial free class after a coworker recommended it and I've been hooked since. I came to OTF when I was in the most out of shape/heaviest state I've ever been in. When I joined, I hated the way my body looked and how out of shape I felt. OTF staff are all friendly, welcoming and encouraging for the members to achieve healthy goals. In the past, I was nervous about attending studio classes and felt very self-conscious, but at OTF, the coaches and other people taking the class are very friendly and encouraging. High-fives and words of encouragement from coaches and other people taking the class happen every single time I attend. There is never a class that I have not felt motivated to push myself to achieve a good workout. So far, I've taken classes with Angel, Ben, Julian, Brooklyn, Jen, and Sarah. Angel (I believe) is the lead coach is she is beyond friendly, kind and welcoming. All of the coaches have the most amazing and inspiring energy and really make you feel like you can push yourself during the class. OTF has turned me into someone who enjoys running and I thought that would NEVER happen. I even run on my days I'm not at OTF because I enjoy it so much! The music they play is awesome and a good mix of old school rock and contemporary jams. OTF helped me loose 20lbs, get back in great shape and love my body again. Getting the confidence back to be comfortable in my own skin and feel strong is the most amazing feeling of accomplishment. I'm a member for life and constantly recommend this place to anyone who will listen. If you're debating trying a class, go for it! You won't be disappointed and you'll leave feeling amazing.",

I mean, yes, please swiftly swim to my drowning child in high tops!\n\nAll in all, it's a good facility that offers a lot of options for working out or playing with the family. Compared to other cities, the Indy Y's are about as low cost as you can get--membership fees fluctuate depending on the city in which they are located. It's good bang for your buck.",

The staff is friendly and just cool. No issues, they always answer my questions and they are very helpful.\n\nEquipment. There is ample equipment at this location. Cardio section has elliptical, treadmills, stair masters, bikes, and a few variations of those things.  There are also sections dedicated, to weightlifting, abs, thighs, 30 minute workouts and more.\n\nSpa. So for black card members, there is a spa area where you can get hydro-massages, chair massages, tanning, and a body enhancement machine. I love the hydro-massages; it is definitely a treat after working out.\n\nLocker Room. Lockers, Full shower and Dressing Rooms. Actually pretty nice showers might I add. \n\nParking. There is ample parking in the lot, so there really shouldn't be any trouble.\n\nI normally go to the gym at 6am-8am  or 4:30pm - 6:00 pm range and there is never a crowd issue. Not sure about the other times.",

While the facility itself is nice, clean, large, etc. if you are going for the fitness classes you will be disappointed.  Class would be cancelled at the last minute, instructors would quit and not be replaced, substitute instructors would teach a totally different class than what is on the schedule, etc.  When members complained to management we were told we could always go to another LA Fitness and did not seem interested in fixing the problem. If you are going there just to work out, you can go to Planet Fitness or Gold's Gym for much less.  $35/month is too much money to pay when you're not getting what you are promised.",

From the outside, it looks like a small facility but after walking in, the facility was a pretty big especially with the high ceilings.  The equipment and machines are very spread out and walk room is spacious. The gym is 2 stories with the treadmills are all up there.  the reason for the 3 stars is all the equipment is all old and needs a big renovation.  Even the bathrooms are very old which only has 2 toilets. But then again, this club is only an Active so what do you expect, its the entry level of 24hr fitness.",

I was shocked by the amount of people there in the late morning on a Tuesday and I'm now convinced that no one in St Pete works, but that's beside the point.\n\nThe gym was decent. Fairly clean bathrooms, and I liked the stall area they have outside the shower for extra privacy while changing, however the gym area itself felt  very confusing. The machines seemed to have no particular order or organization to them, meaning you had to scurry around the whole gym in order to find machines that all worked a certain muscle. The gym floor itself felt cramped and overcrowded, with many machines  much too close together to achieve a comfortable workout. \n\nThe have such a cool  location and an interesting info set up, but the disorganization makes it hard to have an enjoyable workout at this location.",

  "text": "I sure wish I had any other option for swimming, because this place really sucks.  From the filthy locker rooms full of hair and water damage, to the loud 90's faux punk music blaring in the locker room to the shitty pool that is out of service constantly because they have no one on staff capable of maintaining it.  The good is that it opens very early, the pool is 25 yards and is kept to a temperature that makes swimming laps at least possible. I also like the crowd of women who come early (I'm told the place is essentially a whorehouse if you go in the evening.) The bad is just about everything else.  I really wonder what their insurer would do if they knew that this joint allows people to swim in the pool completely unsupervised with no lifeguard on staff at all every single morning from 5 am to whenever a lifeguard gets there sometime later in the day after 7 or 8 or so.  Also, on numerous occasions I've gotten there and no one has showed up to open the place.  Once on a weekend there was a crowd of about 50 people in the parking lot waiting for someone to show up; I finally gave up after about 45 minutes of waiting that day.  It's really unbelievable.  The place is so poorly run and so shoddy it kills me to pay them every month, but sadly there is nowhere else to swim.  As soon as the new YMCA opens, I am OUT of that hell hole.",

  "text": "I purposely avoided joining City Fitness prior to their opening and immediately after because I knew there would likely be some hurdles to overcome. Judging by the early reviews, I was right in my decision. But now that they are in their third month, things seem to be flowing smoothly. I've been a member for two weeks now and I'm very happy with my decision to make the switch from my old gym to this one. \n\nFor starters, the facility is brand new. That means everything is clean, machines are new, nice locker rooms, etc. The two-story layout is interesting and the hallway downstairs is a little tight but after a few trips to the locker rooms after using the back staircase, I feel like I know where everything is located. \n\nEveryone on the staff is super friendly. That's important. You don't want to join a gym and feel awkward. I've been greeted with friendly hellos or goodbyes every time I've gone so far. The towel service is great, and there are always plenty of fluffy hand towels available.  \n\nI purchased the highest tier membership, which includes all classes and access to the We Fit classes. This membership was only five dollars more than my previous gym, and now I'm getting access to the circuit training classes I used to seek outside of my old gym (an extra expense I'll no longer have to worry about). I took advantage of my free personal training session and liked it enough that I have signed up to train with David once a week. Since I'm currently training for Broad Street, I'll probably stick to the treadmills and my PT for the next couple months, but I look forward to trying the classes and We Fit after the run. \n\nBottom line, I'm really happy City Fitness finally made it to the neighborhood!",

  "text": "My husband and I went through a short but intense cycling phase and didn't enjoy our experience at Soho. Firstly, they separated our bikes after they told us we'd be riding together. That didn't start our experience well at all. Then we went to the extremely small locker area with one flimsy bench for everyone cycling (i.e., dozens of people) to use. It was so cramped and obviously didn't smell pleasant with so many bodies crushed together changing shoes.\n\nThe classroom is large, but there are one or two load-bearing poles that make some bikes less desirable than others. The floor is so slippery with the cycling shoes on. I almost witnessed a pregnant woman slip and fall face-first. Thankfully, she caught herself on another bike. \n\nThere were technical issues throughout the class, with music not playing for various reasons. The instructor had to go to the back several times, which killed the energy every time.\n\nWe had been to CycleBar a lot before trying Soho, so we naturally compared everything (as is the nature of Yelp) and concluded that Soho didn't have any positives over CycleBar, which has a large locker area with multiple restrooms, carpet throughout the studio to negate slipping, stadium seating in the studio (so you're not staring at someone's butt crack the whole time), snacks, cold and tepid water dispensers, zero technical malfunctions in the many times we've gone, much more parking, and the list goes on.\n\nAfter the Soho class ended, we headed to the locker area and discovered children playing with tablets and toys on the one available bench. Again, we maneuvered through dozens of people to get our stuff together and return our shoes. Just not a comfortable experience. A staff member asked us how class went. When I said it had been \"okay,\" he didn't inquire further, which indicated to me that nobody there really cares to improve the customer experience.\n\nI'm giving two stars instead of one, because the instructor and workout were fine. It was a decent workout, and we left sweaty. It was the first and last time we'll go to Soho. I definitely recommend CycleBar instead.",

The contract gives you 5 business days to cancel, I canceled in 3 days. It has been OVER a month and I have called numerous times for the refund of my down payment and all you can get a hold of is the receptionist.

  "text": "This one really disappointed me. I just moved to 15th and Reed st and was looking for a gym with a personal trainer.\nFirst I call their location on Wharton St which is a couple blocks from my house. The first thing I say is \"hey I was looking to speak to someone about memberships\" the person responds and says \"can you call back in like 15 minutes? Everyone's very busy right now\". I responded nicely no problem.\nIt was apparent they're location was busy if they asked me to call back, so then I thought hey let's just call and see if someone at the South St location can help me out because I work on south st a block away and it's a good chance I'll be going to both locations if possible. I call up and a very nice girl answers the phone and I asked the same question as I did the first location, she asked if I could hold briefly, which I did. She returns and says \"hey everyone's with someone right now can we have someone call you back\" I responded \"It seems like you guys are a little too busy for a someone who wants to be a new customer huh\" she responded telling me how they were slightly short staffed for it being a Tuesday night which I understood and was fine with, she than went totally out of her way to explain a few things about the membership and how it works and settled me for sure. She told me she would have Harrison they're lead guy give me a call back in 10 minutes which I was cool with because I didn't have plans for a couple hours. The time went by much past 10 minutes and I get a call from Harrison at 9 pm when I was already out with a couple of friends that I wanted to actually join a gym with. I gave a call back the following day and asked for Harrison, was put on hold and than told he was unavailable and he would call me back very shortly when he's done. I understand work is stressful and people get busy but for 2 of their places to be too busy to talk to a new member immediately makes no sense to me when it comes to a business aspect or a customer service aspect. I unfortunately don't know if I would sign up with city fitness at this point. I am going to check out other places in the area and go from there.",

  "text": "I can understand the hype about Solidcore. But for those who are looking for a pilates place that you can learn the more technical stuff and to correct your form, this is not it. I went to Solidcore twice with their new member deal (2 classes for $42) but I found the experience both quite similar. The class is not interactive as in that the instructor is not doing the moves together with you. The instructor instead is yelling at you the instructions while the music is blasting, making it super difficult to understand. This is frustrating because the instructions themselves are quite complex as it's not a simple \"squat 10 times\" but \"put your foot on this platform and place your hands here and do this.\" For someone who has no experience with a reformer (the Pilates machine), it's quite hard to keep pace. Once you understand what to do, yes the moves are hard. But I don't mind that as I know that solidcore is known for their hard workouts. However, I wish it was easier to follow so that I could get to the hard workouts faster instead of wasting time trying to understand what is going on.\n\nI will say, the few days after solidcore, I was very sore. I appreciate the philosophy of solidcore about engaging in small repetitive movements to engage the core and other body parts. I wish I could have liked solidcore because it really is a good workout, but I found myself struggling and lost on the instructions 25% of the time. The instructors were very high energy and optimistic.",

The regular weekday Zumba instructors, Loretta and Tommy are the best! And Mary Kay's class on Sunday is also a lot of fun. There's a class on Saturdays, but it's at 8AM, and that's just a bit too early on a Saturday.

I would not hesitate to bring newbies to the classes. \n\nThe gym facilities are nice, and there's plenty of treadmills, ellipticals, and bikes, but I'm not a frequent user of the equipment. Also, there are personal trainers and massage therapists, but I have not taken advantages of these added services. \n\nThe staff at the front desk are really friendly, as well as most members of the gym.

My eating habits worsened once I began my new job and I wanted to get back to eating healthier.\nThe only reservation I had is that Malcolm would be an intense trainer and force me to do exercises I was not comfortable with. Malcolm went over each exercise with me and ensured my form was good. Whenever I had questions about an exercise Malcolm went over them with me and ensure I mastered the exercises before the next time I went to the gym.\n\nI really like the online app and that I am able to track my workouts, cardio, and weight. It's great that I am able to see the difference since the time I started working with Malcolm until now. Malcolm is also always available when I have questions and he gives me honest feedback.\n\nThree other benefits are: being able to talk to Malcolm through the app, Malcolm helped me work on my nutrition as well, and Malcolm also spoke to me about the importance of my water intake. I would recommend Malcolm to everyone I know! He wants to see you succeed and lose weight. He is also very personable and down to earth. I was not expecting that in a trainer. I'm glad I had the opportunity to work with Malcolm so far I have lost about 13lbs and counting. Malcolm helped me to push myself harder and to not be afraid of pushing my boundaries and eating healthy.",

The staff is great, they get to know you like a friend when you walk in. The instructors are great as well. I love that I never get bored with the classes as they are always changing them up. Since I've started I've lost a good amount of weight and my cardio abilities are vastly improved, it's really helped me condition for big hikes I've gotten into.

No ask for money to pay for it, just an offer to show me some things.\n\nFrom there he talked about some options, because I asked, not because he pushed, about personal training.  I signed up that day.  It was his non-pushy approach in the sale that he got one.\n\nSince then, I have been working with Rocky.  He is awesome.  Hands down one awesome trainer.  He listens to my needs and respects my goals (I wanted to just get fit and not huge; I just want to be around when my kids are older).  I am not fat by any means, but I needed a push to get my fitness back to a good point.  \n\nI have weekly 30 minute sessions with Rocky and am glad for the weekly push to get up and get moving.  Being a web designer/nonprofit professional by trade it doesn't give me much time to get active, except the weekends.\n\nNow about the gym itself.  I am giving 5 stars because of the features of the gym.  There are classes happening all the time and they have an app for the iPhone (I don't know about Droid) displaying all of their class schedules.  There is a saline pool to do laps, a room off to the side only for women (so they don't have to feel like they are being watched by everyone in the gym). There are more than enough cardio machines and most of the weight machines are always available.  They have lots of televisions to watch while doing cardio and a side spin classroom and aerobic room for classes.\n\nWhat is great about this location is also their willingness to watch your kids at no extra cost.  You have to stay on premisses,  but they will keep your kids up to two hours while you work out at no extra cost.  \n\nI am thoroughly impressed by this gym.",

  "text": "Dear old city sweat fitness, i realize that this review only furthers your decline on yelp but, in my opinion is necessary. This may potentially get removed because i will outright admit i have yet to actually use your facility. However, i do see the validity in wanting to review your business practices, though i haven't come inside. STOP putting solicitation fliers on everyones vehicles! At a minimum, it is one of the single most obnoxious and, honestly, desperate moves a local business can do.\n\n If you were having a charity event or community event you were trying to make the neighborhood aware in a short period of time, i can at least semi-understand that. You want to spam everyone? Pay for it and do it via snail-mail like all the other businesses in the area. Do NOT litter on peoples vehicles, especially those of whom are your neighbors. Not only is it obnoxious, irritating, and burdening on the owner of the vehicle (thanks, now i have to shove trash in my car because i'm not an asshole who litters, just you), it is also illegal without a commercial solicitation permit from the city which i hope you have, since i filed complaints with both the BBB and the DA's office.",

It also keeps getting better all the time!!\nWe (my wife and I) went to the same gym for about 14 years when we lived in NJ. It was hard to find a place we would be so happy with again. But when I first moved back to the city, i checked out a few gyms, but City Fitness felt right from the minute i walked in. Steph explained everything and showed me all around the place and (still makes sire all is great for us). I joined immediately and brought my wife in a few days later. I am there 6 days a week and couldn't be  happier. Love all the classes and the instructors are great. Analis, Carrie, Jackie, Katie, Chris, Chuck, Kelly, Dayna, Jacquie, Ted, Rachel and Christian are ALL awesome.

I originally signed up for semi-private lessons with Steve, but since no one else typically shows up during my time slot, I essentially have been getting private lessons.  Each time I go we work on form, technique, etc.  Additionally, Steve throws in some core and leg exercises so I get a full workout to compliment my boxing lesson.  Steve is a great guy to train with and he'll consistently push you.  The name of the place is well suited because that's exactly what's going to happen to you if you come.  Not the biggest gym, but it gets the job done and that's all that matters.  If you don't mind taking a hit to your wallet in exchange for hitting the bags I recommend checking this place out.",

  "text": "There is plenty of criticism in the reviews of other yelpers, so I will keep this short and sweet.  This was a great gym when it was Gold's, but it has rapidly gone downhill since changing ownership.  Though there has been some turnover since then, a lot of the Gold's staff stayed on through the transition.  I have never had a problem with customer service here.  In fact, when I canceled my membership (of several years), the  young man who assisted me concurred with my observations and frustrations.  The problem with this gym boils down to greedy leadership (at the corporate level) more interested in short-term bottom line profits than it is interested in the quality of its product.  It appears that \"more=better\" in the minds of Fitness Connection executives.  It could not be more apparent that the modus operandi of this corporation is to just keep signing more members until they surpass maximum occupancy.  Any decent gym adds more classes when they become really popular.  The class schedule here hasn't changed since it was Gold's back in the day!  The classes and instructors are still great, the problem is overcrowding and management's lack of interest in expanding their offerings.  Why pay another freelance fitness instructor, when you can cram your members in like sardines?  I am absolutely SHOCKED that equipment is constantly broken and that the facility and equipment simply are not cleaned.  Ever.  It is such a shame...What a waste of wonderful resources.  On a positive note, contrary to what I have read from other yelpers, canceling my membership was easy peasy.",

However, my friend who signed up because I raved about how amazing fitness connection was, has dealt with rude staff and had unauthorized withdrawals from her banking account on countless occasions ranging from $10-$100. When she has tried to rectify this or at least understand the reason for the withdrawl, attempting to give them the benefit of the doubt, they give her the run around and get extremely curt with her transferring her back and forth between departments and providing her with \"help desk\" numbers that do not help, or even answer half the time. My only complaint is that some of the machines are often out of order. I love the classes, I wish they would add more that aren't so early in the morning, given the fact that my work out partner and I both work nights and it is often difficult to pull ourselves out of bed at 8 am. I know they have 430 classes but we are already headed to work at that time. I think anywhere from 11 am - 1pm would be perfect! Just a suggestion though. Again, the staff has been awesome to me, I  wish I could give one more star, but it's unfortunate that 2 of my friends had similar experiences here.",

The gym is great: large, clean, friendly, and a wide range of ages and physical fitness. You can read the other reviews for that info. My review is going to explain why I'm not giving it five stars.\n\nThe main reason I chose this above other gyms was their childcare. The only way I was going to be able to workout was if I had someplace for my child to go. I thought the LAFitness Kids' Klub would be a great solution. Unfortunately, it's not. The large TV is on the whole time, and often very loud. They don't even play nature or science stuff on there; it's all Disney movies. I'd expected that a fitness club would understand the importance of having kids do active things and move their bodies. There is some play equipment there, but my son tells me that he was told not to climb on it because he would get hurt. Most of the time when I walk in there all or most of the kids are sitting in chairs up close to the TV, even the very youngest of them. The vibe in there is also quite negative; the workers seem depressed.\n\nIt makes me feel awful that here I am, trying to have a healthy lifestyle, but while I'm working out, my son is sitting there like a zombie. I try to rush through my workout to get him out of there as soon as possible, but it still makes me feel guilty. I'm really not sure how long I'm going to keep this up.",

I eat a lot. \n\nThe gym owner at my old gym upset me with his misogynistic comments and consistent inability to take constructive feedback. I went there for 17 months.

  "text": "I love the idea of the Y and this is the only branch I've been to so I can only comment on this facility but as much as I want to love it, it definitely needs improvement. The cleanliness gets 2 stars at best. The floors in the yoga room, group fitness & the basement level room are filthy. My guess is they are almost never cleaned. It's difficult to do Barre because certain exercises require a sliding motion & you're sticking to the floor. The noise level in the yoga room is almost hilarious. During the rest period at the end of class you can hear every conversation from the locker rooms, toilets flushing, the bathing suit dryer spinning, the doors slamming, kids whining & screaming, you name it. The yoga room is too small & awkward with the amount of people they allow in. The last three classes were so tight we couldn't do several of the poses the instructor wanted to do because there wasn't enough room. People show up for yoga late, even 10 minutes into class & are allowed in a packed class where they force everyone to squeeze in even tighter disrupting the others practice to the point it's un-enjoyable. The instructor put up a sign yesterday at the beginning of class that said it was at capacity & three more people came in after several minutes completely ignoring the posted sign on the door. At that point the instructor should have asked them to not come in but I realize that might be awkward for them to have to do. \nThe parking lot is not planned well & most spaces are too narrow for most cars/SUVs to fit into forcing people to use two spaces. I was unable to get into my car one day & had to climb in from the passenger side when someone squeezed in too close & I injured myself climbing into the driver seat. I told the staff later & they had no response or follow up. Having said all this the staff is very friendly mostly & several of the longtime employees are really welcoming to everyone. The instructors are the best part of this Y in my opinion.",

The machines and weights definitely have some years on them but they are usable. \n\nThe gym itself is pretty clean, cleaner than some of the newer LA Fitnesses actually. There's also a relatively comprehensive cardio suite upstairs. Note, however, that this location lacks both a pool and a basketball court so if you're looking for more functional fitness options, you're better off heading to the LA Fitness on 22nd Avenue near Tyrone Mall.\n\nStaff is pretty aloof but I've never had any issues. Parking is plentiful in their private lot. I think the biggest pro of this location is its actual location! I would say this is the most comprehensive gym on this side of St. Petersburg.",

That being said, here goes the rest of the review.\nI took the free introductory kickboxing class and I came away disappointed, because there is ZERO proper technique taught here. Proper stance and foot work? NO! Proper body mechanics and punching / kicking technique? NO \nThey don't even permit sparring here!\nThere is no doubt in my mind that you can or will loose weight and burn calories here but without proper technique someone is eventually going to get hurt flailing around at the abundance of heavy bags. Personally I wouldn't waste my time here, so my search for a proper gym continues",

  "text": "I really liked the location of this gym. It's in a nice looking town center that seems to have a lot of activity going on in it. I would feel safe working out here at night. Based on the other reviews I was expecting this place to be microscopic, but that was not the case at all. This is a decent sized Anytime Fitness that is nowhere near the smallest sized one I have been to. The front of the gym has a collection of the standard machines that you see at almost every location. In the middle is the cardio equipment. I did find it odd that for a gym of this size there are only four treadmills. If you wanted to use one during prime time that could definitely be a problem. There's another room in the back that houses the free weights. There is a squat rack, a smith machine, and a benching station. There is a station for doing seated barbell shoulder presses, which is rare at Anytime Fitness locations. The dumbbells go up to 120 pounds instead of the standard 100 pounds. The fixed weight barbells go up to 110 pounds.\n\nThere is a small room that can be used for classes. I was going to comment that it was nice that there were 3 to 4 spinning cycles in there, until I read the sign that was attached to each of them. The signs stated that the cycles were the personal property of one of the trainers and that they should not be used. Honestly this rubbed me the wrong way. We've all seen signs saying that you shouldn't use equipment that is broken. But to have fully functioning equipment in the gym that I'm not allowed to use? I've never seen that in any of the 20+ locations that I've visited. If I'm paying my monthly dues I should have full access to all of the equipment in the gym period. The locations I've been to in Riverview have lots of cycles available for everyone to use.\n\nI did see several machines that had cracks and splits in the padding on them. The good news is that there are signs throughout the gym stating that a renovation is about to happen (that will not close the gym). Hopefully they will take care of that during the renovation.",

There are 3 separate rows of cardio equipment so you never have to wait for a machine and even if you did, there's the indoor track to get some laps in while you wait. There's a basketball court and indoor lap pools as well as the nicest gym locker rooms I have ever seen. But the reason I kept coming back (even though the cost is sort of unreal) is for the personal training. I trained with Gavin for over a year (until health stuff got in the way) and he got me into incredible shape. We were training on all of he equipment and even using stairs and going outside, the works! He knew exactly what my goals were and he encouraged me every step of the way. I trained for a Spartan Race with him and I got so strong with his help. If it wasn't for the cost, I would still be there training with him. Highly recommend if you can afford it!",

  "text": "In this city filled with yoga studios, running clubs, spinning, and other types of fitness places, I was really looking forward to the opening of CKO Center City! I love the energy of this place! The workout is a sweat fest, and it works out your whole body, both physically and mentally. You soon find muscles in all the right places, and during class your brain keeps telling you that you're not dying, so keep moving! Plus, the thought of going beast mode on a heavy punching bag does more for me than any workout that I've tried. It really is my new obsession. You learn and burn! Learn new combos, and burn off a gazillion (ok, I'm exaggerating, but it seems close to that number) calories at each class.  \n\nThe place has been open a little more than two months, and I've been to enough classes where I've experienced each instructor. All of them are OUTSTANDING and MOTIVATING, and each of them are different. Regardless, every hour you spend at CKO is worth it. I love that you go at your own pace and skill level, so don't feel that you need to kick higher or throw 10 more punches than the person next to you. You compete against yourself to do better, and at the end of class, you leave stronger and confident that the next one will be better than the last. You'll be planking longer, running faster, and throwing more powerful kicks and punches. \n\nFor those that are new, I highly recommend going to your first class 15-20 min early and coming with an open mind. You'll learn the basic punches and kicks with one of the instructors, and then you're all set to join the class for a fun workout! All the classes have the same format: warm up, lots of exercises on your core, work some combos on the bag, maybe 1-2 freestyle sessions, and then a cool down (you'll love the moment when they say starfish!). \n\nI love coming to my new \"therapy sessions\" because it relieves stress, and after a rough day at work, it's awesome to get angry and destroy the bag. \n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, I'll learn to love burpees.",

  "text": "To preface this review let it be know that I'm not very athletic. My high school PE coach once told me he thought badminton might be my sport. That being said, my roommate and a few friends talk up crossfit all the time so I figured I should see what the hype was about.\n\nMy initial fitness level was probably average, high school sports days are way behind me, and regardless-- benchwarmer status. In Nashville I tried out some pure barre here and there, running, different spin classes, etc. but I hadn't committed to anything. I decided to give the Crossfit Forte intro class a try (first one is free) and here they teach you some of the basic moves and the accompanying form. Katelyn was the teacher and she was awesome. She was encouraging, and really really helpful to someone whose only athletic ability apparently reaches its limit with badminton.\n\nAfter the 101 intro class you can sign up to join the regular classes, its $139/ month for 3 days per week, and $169/ month for unlimited. In comparison to spin studios, barre studios, and other workout places around Nashville this is really a steal.\n\nI was sooo nervous for the first day of regular classes and for a quick minute I considered turning my car around and heading home and giving up on this new fitness venture. Luckily, I bit the bullet and went inside. Evan was the coach on the first day and he, just like Katelyn, was great. He made sure to introduce the new people to the class, explained each move as we went, and helped with modifications. Since the first day, the coaches have been nothing less than encouraging and supportive.\n\nThe rest of the reviews really touch on how great this crossfit gym is. There have been a few events planned since I started and the community feel is no joke. People of all fitness levels workout at CrossFit Forte; the gym is fun and everyone is committed, helpful, and friendly.\n\nI am really happy with my decision to try out crossfit and join CrossFit Forte. It has only been a few weeks but I already feel somewhat athletic (say whaaat?!).",

  "text": "I tried out this location using a guest pass during a really busy week (during which I didn't have time to drive to my normal gym - the West Chester YMCA).  This place definitely has perks that the Y doesn't - an insanely huge and nice locker room, a juice bar (though, I'm still not sure what \"magic milk\" is), a tiered spin studio (loved the look of that and wish I could have tried a spin class), etc.  But overall, this place just wasn't for me.  I didn't like the layout of the cardio machines and prefer other machines to the Lifestyle brand that LA Fitness carries.  The group exercise schedule wasn't as thorough as I hoped and the (one) pool was small.  I also missed the smaller, more intimate feeling that I enjoy at the Y.  This place just confirmed for me that large chain-style gyms aren't for me.",

  "text": "RowZone is what all exercise classes in Philadelphia should strive to be. It's challenging, it's well-designed, it's encouraging and it's fun. I have tried RowZone via class pass twice, and even in my short tenure as a customer, I have realized that the members of this gym are a community. Through the sweat and loud music, you hear members supporting one another and coaches cheering you to push just a little harder. \n\nWhat I like most about this gym, is it's a low key, no frills environment. Many of the classes I have done through class pass (while challenging and enjoyable) have been in super glamorous gyms, with loud music and DJs, dark lighting, etc.  I don't need to pay for the frills, just deliver a workout that's going to kick my butt. RowZone is exactly that, the room is lined with erg machines and there is an assortment of free weights available for exercises you do off the machine. There are lockers for your belongings and a fridge to keep your water cold for after the workout. \n\nRowing is a great full body workout, and the class is designed to get you on and off the erg. There are a few circuits for each class, some are AMRAPs, some are focused on the distance rowing. In addition to rowing, you work in some strength training using both dumbbells and body weight. It's high intensity with low impact. \n\nI have told a few people about this gym so far, and what a great feeling it is when you complete the workout! I'm hoping to bring my parents next time because I think they would really like the intensity without the impact on their joints!",

  "text": "I belonged to a Lifetime Athletic outside of Chicago and the Tampa club doesn't compare to the one back in IL. The IL club was two stories higher, thousands of square feet larger, had WAY more equipment (especially cardio), had indoor and outdoor, huge swimming pools  and was $50 a month CHEAPER. Makes absolutely no sense to me. Summary:\n\nPROS\n1. Obviously very, very clean and well-maintained\n\n2. Nice locker rooms, free towels, eucalyptus steam room, nice showers (although there are only 6 or 7), free quality shampoo, conditioner, body wash.  Deodorant, hair spray, mouthwash. \n\n3. State-of-the-art cardio equipment (although there are no cross ramp ellipticals, which I love)\n\n4. Brand new machines (cardio and weight)\n\n5. Very nice and helpful staff\n\n6. No crowds whatsoever. I was there today, Monday at 530pm and I saw maybe 15 other people. Granted, they just opened two days prior but still, very weird. But at the same time, it was nice not having to wait on any machines or for a shower. \n\n7. Whirlpools in the locker rooms\n\n8. Has a child care center for the latchkey kids\n\n\n\nCONS\n1. Way overpriced. Not worth the $140 per month fee plus initiation fee.  I'd be ok paying $80 per month. \n\n2. Very, very small. Even seemed smaller than some good clubs I've been to. Also very weird because it looks huge from the outside. \n\n3. No swimming pool. Lifetime is known for their amazing pools but not even a kiddie pool in this one (although they have the aforementioned whirlpools in the locker rooms)\n\n4. Not a big variety of cardio equipment or weight machines. \n\n5. Not 24 hours like most Lifetimes\n\n\nThat's pretty much it. Like I said, very very nice club, but not worth the price. More pros than cons but the cons are pretty steep.  And I have a feeling if they don't lower that monthly fee, they won't be in business very long.",

  "text": "If you are looking for a solid gym, this is for you.   \n\nI was in the market for a new gym after graduating from the UA. I am a very critical consumer and I did my homework before visiting this gym. I have to say that many of the reviews here paint a poor picture, so I thought I'd share my experience as you shop for the best gym for you.   \n\nNote: I visited most of the commercial gyms in Tucson prior to signing up, and I enjoyed a 3-day trial run over most of the one-day passes. It ensured the best fit for me.   \n\nPros: Big open space (Chuze and Planet feel so small in their strip mall style), lots of different machines, pool, courts, Large variety of free classes. No contract.   \n\nCons: Busy at 4:30-6pm, only open until 8pm on weekends, no towel service for the pool  I would like to mention two key inquiries in my consideration of this facility. \n\nIf you note other reviews, people say they feel uncomfortable because of the \"bros\" and \"meatheads.\" I was reasonably concerned about this. I have found quite the opposite. There is the full range of people here. I personally think the old ladies are adorable. Everyone is kind and respectful. Even though, I lift 20lbs next to someone lifting 100lbs. There has never been any hostility.   \n\nAnother consideration was the busy hours. Simple reality. It is busy. I like to go at 8pm. A lot less people. (and yes there are 8pm classes).   You will read about the sales people in the comments. This is a business folks. Yes, they are trying to make a sale. Look online before you go in. See if there are coupons and deals. Know the price you can get. Be a smart consumer. I notice that only people that complain seem to post.   \n\nHope this helps you. Picking a gym can be a very stressful experience! But this place helps me destress every day.",

The environment could not be more comfortable. With a max class size of 4, you get one on one guidance and every person I've been in class with has been super friendly. Lilly is delightful!

  "text": "I have been a member at this gym for a long time. I initially began my membership when it was golds gym, which I loved a lot. I don't mind spending the extra $10-$15 a month for a clean gym with updated/functioning equipment. When fitness connection took over, I renewed my membership, and got a much better deal $10 a month. \nHowever, I was wrong about being happy with the $10 a month membership fee. It seems as if the WHOLE world goes to fitness connection; too many young high school students that don't take their work-out serious; and their equipment is super worn out and outdated. They have not changed their equipment, at least not since I've been a member (4+years). \nIf you plan on going to the gym after 5pm, forget about funding a functioning cardio machine or having space to do weights. I went a few times to do cardio around 9-10pm & it was still super crowded at that time. \nAs far as cleanliness goes, the main floor is very clean. There's always someone cleaning the equipment and floors. However, the men's locker room is not the same story. The men's locker room is filthy. There's always wrappers & used paper towels on the floor. The sink counters haven't been cleaned in who knows how long. Some lockers don't function. The carpet is very worn out. \nOverall, I do not recommend this gym. I enjoyed the quality of my workouts much better when it was Gold's Gym. $10 a month, yeah, but you get what you pay for. \nHope this review helps & is seen by the Fitness Connection management.",

The fella who showed me around was very friendly and totally excited about the gym. Encouraged me to take advantage of all the classes offered, which I may start with AM Boot Camp tomorrow....hello 6:30AM (ugh).\n\nThis time of the morning wasn't too crowded -- plenty of available machines and lots of room on the stretch mats. I didn't do any lifting, but it seemed that anyone there had their choice of machines during the hour I was there.\n\nI went back again after work and while it was much more crowded, it wasn't overwhelming. I was able to get a treadmill right away and then a stationary bike. While it's cool that the treadmills have personal TVs, it's a bit much since they're so close to your face. The desk was manned this time around (more people working, so it makes sense) and the staff was again very friendly.\n\nI enjoyed my first day and hope the rest of the trial goes as well. I'm still not clear on where all the classes take place, but I definitely want to get involved in some of them. Good variety: yoga, boot camp, zumba, Indian dancing, spinning, and a lot more.",

The only complaints that I have is the paper towel holder near the ellipticals is usually out and ladies who wear way too much perfume make me want to gag. It seriously makes me have a hard time breathing when they get on equipment right beside me. It smells like gardenia and old wooden musty closets. I wish they would put up signs asking people to refrain from having perfume or cologne on until after their showers .",

  "text": "I feel kind of weird giving a gym a 5-star review, but I really have no complaints with this location, so we're going for it! \n\nI've been a member for a little over a year (can't say I attended regularly during that whole time, though :x ) This location was my first experience with a Planet Fitness, and I'd have to say I'm impressed! For all I've heard about them, especially for their membership pricing, I figured it'd be cheap and rundown and bare-minimum ammenities. This is not the case! \n\nThe place is huge- there are always enough of the machines, even when it's busy. Sometimes you have to wait for weights when it's busy, but everyone is always pretty courteous about not hogging for too long. \n\nStaff has always been nothing but helpful and welcoming. Always being sure to welcome you in and send you off with well wishes. \n\nThey do offer free group and one-on-one workouts with their trainer M-F. I haven't done these yet, but I've seen them in progress and they seem beneficial to those new to the space or unsure of how to get jump-started in their workout journey. \n\nIf you're in their upper-tier membership, you can use their red-light machines, tanning booths and massage chairs. I haven't worked up the nerve to use these yet, but I always longingly look at the massage chairs on my way out.",

  "text": "I've been a member here for a little over a year. First the good.\n\nThis facility is beautiful. The architectural design is pleasant and well planned inside and out. The fitness center, which is the reason I joined, has high quality equipment and a nice selection of classes. Many of the staff and instructors here are friendly and helpful.\n\nThat said, there are some things that pull this otherwise nice facility down. Really down! The rules posted -  no cell phones in the gym, re-stack and don't drop weights, wipe down the equipment, etc... - are never enforced. People routinely use an exercise machine as a lounge chair to chat on the phone, text, talk to a gym buddy, or for some purpose other than exercise and are never spoken to by staff. Weights drop constantly and unnecessarily and I have never seen staff address this with an offender. Maintenance on the machines, like the bikes in the spin room, is wanting and mentioning this to staff seems ineffective. Several bikes have been in need of repair for some time.\n\nThen there is the behavior of some, and I emphasize SOME, of the gym-goers. While plenty of gym wipes are available, many lack the proper gym etiquette to use them. Profanity and stories about jail are not uncommon. Again, it's frustrating to have to ask a person to get off of a machine they are NOT using so you can use it for its intended purpose. People don't re-stack weights. People DO drop weights. Children often run about unsupervised (although staff does seem to address this when they see it). There is just a relatively high level of inconsideration and little knowledge of etiquette. \n\nOh...and the parking lot is too small and people seem to lack sufficient driving skill to take up only one spot.\n\nSo, why do I stay here? It's reasonably priced and is overall a nice place. But, with a little effort from the staff to not only post rules but to gently and kindly enforce them, this place could be so much nicer.",

  "text": "I jumped around gyms/health clubs quite a bit in the last 12 years since I moved to Philly from NY. I went to Sweat, PSC and finally joined The Sporting Club in April 2015. It's the best gym Philadelphia can offer, for now. Depending on what you want, I love most of the classes I go to. They have a wide selection but I have my favorite classes and instructors that I follow.  I highly recommend: Nathaniel who teaches Hatha is a really fantastic instructor who pays attention to your alignment (Hatha), Miko, Jen & Remi (Hatha and Vinyassa), Jamie is simply the best (hip-hop), Nicole is high energy combo Zumba/hip hop class too. Luis and Laura (Zumba), Emily (Boot camp) and Kristin (Pilates) classes.  They also have Aquafit, TRX, Spinnjng and Barre classes.  Kelli's Barre class is wonderful and Kristin's Pilates mat class will kick your abs! The studios are all hardwood floors and kept clean.  The towels are constantly kept washed, fresh and clean. Clean locker rooms, steam room, dry sauna and jacuzzi are wonderful amenities. The olympic sized pool is great with lukewarm water temp all year round but the cool ambient air can make it feel cold in the winter. The weight room is expansive & updated machines. You get all sorts of people that come to this gym - the lookers, the onlookers and wants to be looked at.  Of course there are the ones that just go & workout and doesn't care (that's me).  They also have a basketball court which draws all kinds of leagues but not necessarily the usual health club  members. They also have squash & racquetball courts.  The front desk people are nice, especially Chuck who greets most people by their first names! A plus for him. The sales staff are helpful...well its sales. Hannah Purbe who is the Group Fitness Director is awesome and responsive to our suggestions, if reasonable.  I also love their indoor running track, so kind to your knees. Its not Equinox (my gym in NYC) but the Sporting Club is as good as its gonna get as far as Philly is concerned. I wish they would replace those stinky carpets along the stairways that somehow soaks up the smelly sweat from people. The management & customer service seem to be more responsive these days and a bit better with communication.  Watch out though if you catch them on a bad day, they might give you the attitude or no response at all.  P.s. I ran into Bradley Cooper in the elevator one afternoon.",

My friend gave me a three day trial pass and I completely fell in love. If I wasn't moving from the city I would definitely consider joining. The kettle-bell class was great, followed by a strength/cardio class (with mini trampoline!), followed by the intense TRX class. Also, next day I tried spinning which was good. There is tons of cardio equipment (with actual working TVs and multiple channels) and also tons of weights, indoor track, and pool. I only hope my future gym will be as good otherwise I'll have so suck it up and sign up for this one. I haven't been this excited to go to the gym in forever. This is great for anyone who loves variety  of work outs from boot camp/cross fit type classes, to spinning, yoga and zumba and is bored with their current fitness routine. I could spend all day there and never leave.\n\nThe best part? The atmosphere, you forget you are in Philly.\n\nPS. LA Fitness is actually embarrassing at this point, and should really get one star.\n\nSigh....",

I didn't want to derail my fitness too much and being that I am a Crossfitter anyway, I decided taking a Crossfit class would probably be a very good idea. I did a little Yelp search for Crossfit gyms only two came up. The closest to the house I was staying at was Crossfit NOLA. I perused the website and it would set me back $20 to attend a class. An average price for most places. I sent out an e-mail explaining I was visiting from out of town and would like to attend a class. I promptly received a welcoming response. \n\nCut to Thursday afternoon and I walk into Crossfit NOLA. The previous class was wrapping up so I checked out the space and it is typical of a Crossfit gym: bars, kettlebells, weights at one wall, pull up bars along another. There was a guy at the laptop which I assumed was the trainer and I was correct. He immediately asked if I was the visitor and I told him yes. He welcomed me and had me fill out some paperwork. Soon more people arrived and the class started. \n\nAfter busting my ass class came to an end. I had a great workout!

And if you don't mind the darkness and orange lighting - it feels almost like a night club. The monitors that tell you how you are doing are pretty much the only reason I keep coming back. \n\nIt's like one of those group bootcamp workouts, but it's not crazy like Crossfit. it's different every day, which keeps it somewhat interesting but if you aren't a fan of the treadmill or rowing, this ain't for you. \n\nBasically you spend 30 min on the tread, or rower/weight room--- and then switch off. They say it's a 500-1000 calorie workout but so far my best ever was 470 calories and 11 minutes in the Orange zone. \n\nThe ppl taking classes aren't that friendly either. They don't even smile at you when you pass. They definitely don't have the kind of camaraderie that you get in a Crossfit box. \n\nIf you miss a class, you get charged $10. Or, if you are on the 8x a month plan, you lose your class. Unless you cancel 12/24 hours in advance. I don't recall which it is. \n\nFor now, I'll keep on going because it's conveniently located. And the only other equally accessible gym is YouFit. But its just ok.",

Fairly priced membership with the added benefits aside from just using the gym.  Clean facility, I've always had a great workout every time I go.  I would LOVE a third rower since that's typically the only machine I have to wait for, but I know space is limited.  I have been a member at several previous gyms and this one surpasses the rest by far.  I did see several reviews criticizing the far walk from the parking lot to the gym, but I actually appreciate the longer walk; isn't that why most of us are there, to exercise? Great place!",

They have lots of membership discounts for various businesses and services and many employers have membership discount deals, so ask when you go to sign up. Gym is usually pretty clean, they run out of cleaner and towels for the machines pretty regularly, and I wish they would go back to the disinfectant wipes they used to provide so you didn't have to spray cleaner. There is often at least one rowing or star master machine that is broken, but they keep fixing them. Minor issues that you would experience at any gym. \n\nI've been working with a personal trainer 3x a week since December and have lost 50lbs! I highly recommend working with trainer Tyler D. He is super supportive and effective. The sessions are cheaper the more you sign up for and if you pay in advance and the trainers focus on exercise and diet, they put you on a meal plan to track your micros and they check in with you daily to see how you are doing. The environment is very welcoming and the program has been life changing for me!",

I tried to use the baby pool with my little ones and they close the pool for camp 9-3:30 every day in the summer.  And even though I am a paying member and both pools were empty due to lunchtime for campers, they wouldn't let me allow my baby & toddler to use the baby pool for 20 minutes AFTER their front desk clerk told me it was open and I spent 20 minutes getting everyone into swim diapers, required plastic pants and swim trunks.  When I pleaded my case, they said that they couldn't do anything about it.  So I did - I took my money elsewhere.  \n\n\nThey told me it would take 60 days to cancel and I told them that if I got charged for a MINUTE more let alone 60 more days, I would file a complaint with the owner and investigate legal options.  \n\nI am a reasonable person but I am also logical and if a pool is empty and a member is standing there asking for 20 minutes in the BABY POOL you oblige.  No negotiating - you just oblige.",

I highly recommend the group fitness classes - if you're like me and need structure or a start/end time, that's the way to go. I've tried almost every class they offer and they are all amazing! Any class you can take with Becca D. is worth your time - she is an amazing fitness instructor, and if you love Zumba, she's your girl! Amy is wonderful for yoga, though again - all of the instructors are great. The gym is always clean and well-maintained. The locker rooms are kept clean and they provide a hair dryer, which is so convenient for those of us that need to get ready again after a workout. \n\nAs Tom mentioned in his review, the gym is NEVER overcrowded. I recently attended the 80's Zumba Party and we comfortably had 75 people in class enjoying the party with plenty of room. Even at the busiest times, the gym isn't jam packed.",

  "text": "Facilities: 2 stars. The tile around the pool and hot tub was definitely dirty. I saw a lot of hair that REALLY grossed me out. The hot tub itself was kinda clean, but the paint was really chipping off making it look dirtier than it probably was. My massage room was clean and the pool chairs and sauna were nice. The women's locker room needed some work. The shower had excellent water pressure and complimentary shampoo, conditoner and bodywash but again it desperately needed a deep clean. The grout was full of mold, which was pretty gross. Someone needs to get a powerwasher in there STAT. Also, people were drinking complimentary water out of styrofoam cups and leaving them all over the damn place and no one was picking them up. A couple sat in the locker room for at least 3 hours. \n\nMassage: 4 stars. My masseuse was polite, asked me about my specific needs, and provided a relaxing, 50 minute experience. I wish she worked more on the horrendous knots in my shoulders, but I did not have a deep tissue so I can't blame her for that. \n\nOther: 3 stars The lotion they used in the massage was unscented. Personally, I like to smell either like a coconut, sugar cookie, or grapefruit after leaving a massage so the fact there was no smell to transport me to a happy place was disappointing. I realize how silly that sounds. Also, there was \"relaxing music\" but it sounded like Spa playlist from Spotify that didn't have any transition between the songs. It was actually distracting, because there would be classical music then the song would end, a 3 second pause, and then tropical thunder sounds would play, then stop and pause 3 seconds, and then ocean sounds would start. It was just confusing and I could not get into my relaxation zone. \n\nOverall, an okay place to get a massage, especially on a budget. If you are a germaphobe, stay away, because I am not and I was kinda skeeved out.",

My personal favorite trainer is Rich, because he takes the time to genuinely get to know people. He is a leader, motivating people to be their best and adapting the workouts to people's needs. As for the center itself, they offer good hours and one on one training which is invaluable to those who don't prefer group workouts. It is a bit pricey, but the variety of exercise and training styles is worth it with the right trainers. The only reason I'm rating 4 stars instead of 5 is because new owners (co-owners?) are coming in and I'm not sold yet.",

Be aware that there is a $100 initiation fee that they 'fail' to mention when you are talking to them about the program. It's $115 a month. If you decide to opt out for any period of time, you must call/email the front office to let them know or they WILL continue to bill you.\n I was charged for 4 months after I opted out and noticed the charges on my credit card statement. It is questionable whether or not, according to Platoon that I opted out correctly, but what happened to the customer is king, or the customer is always right. Apparently the person I was dealing with didn't get that memo. I tried to get a refund on the 4 months and they did not want to give it to me. After several emails back and forth, they offered me two, we settled on three. I disputed the charges with my credit card company and the individual in the front office was 'disappointed' (boo-hoo) that I disputed the charges so he billed me again to make a point. REALLY? I'd stay away from these guys unless you over communicate or pay with a check, they seem like real shysters.",

It's rare to meet someone as perfect at their job as Elizabeth. \n\nI've been unable to workout consistently for several years due to workout related injuries and had almost given up on being able to exercise again. My studies also keep me super busy and I never thought I had the time to workout. This all changed when I met Elizabeth...within minutes she was able to assess my physical abilities and develop a regimen of exercises that get my heart rate up while strengthening my body. It's been about a month and I already feel stronger, happier, and more agile. I have more energy and am able to study way more effectively. And she's such a blast to work with that the time FLYS by.\n\nI cannot express how wonderful it is to have peace of mind that I will not be injured during workouts. I feel so safe with Elizabeth - she knows my limits, but she also knows how to push me way beyond what I thought I could do, and the results speak for themselves. Her dedication to you as a client extends well beyond the gym. She's  available via text for questions about diet/overall health and she is SUCH a knowledgeable resource. \n\nThe gym itself is fantastic as well. No frills, just great equipment and a huge variety of free-weights, machines, bands, etc. They keep it VERY clean, which I really appreciate. \n\nIf you've ever considered getting a personal trainer, or are like me and always say that you'll get to working out when things settle down in your life and you have more time (which never actually happens)....try Philly Personal Training out. BEST DECISION EVER!!!!",

The floors are caked with grime. It's not just the grout color folks, the actual tiles are so dirty that your feet stick to them.  There are big clumps of dust, hair, etc floating in the corners along with used bandages inside the lockers.  The locker interiors are never cleaned (shoe dirt, hair, clothes tags, etc.).  Paper towel holders are frequently empty, toilet paper holders in the stalls are also frequently empty but they at least place a couple of rolls on top of the dispenser, like a gas station. The shower room has the worst smell I have ever smelled. A combination of rancid bleach and mildew. Again they simply don't clean. I see the same empty water bottles in the showers day after day. There are some towel hooks that have been missing for months.  I get it, stuff happens, but maintain the place. Lastly, the HVAC system is not strong enough to keep the dressing area cool enough. It's very warm in there. No fans to circulate the air. \n\nThis gym is way too new to have these kind of problems.  Get all of your shots before going into the locker room.",

They give you a free parking pass, everyone is knowledgeable.   A lot of hardcore athletes (as opposed to juice heads) workout here so you can usually pick up some challenging exercises if you just people watch.  They have plenty of classes, pretty much something for everyone.   They have 6 running lanes too.  I usually use lane 5, 7 laps around is a mile if that tells you how big the track is.

  "text": "Verity is a solid, small gym. It has most, if not all, of the essential gym equipment that you need. But the lack of space and multiple sets of dumbbells, benches, squat racks, etc. prevent it from getting the five star reviews. \n\nThe pros of this gym are many. The monthly rate is cheap! And you don't have to be part of a long-term plan. You can just pay month-to-month. There are different membership rates, ranging from ~$15 to ~$30 per month. The cheaper rate restricts your hours, while the higher rates provide you with 24 hour access, guest privileges, and access to the classes. Another pro of this place is the owners / employees. They're all friendly and willing to help. The gym is also extremely clean. From all of the equipment to the locker rooms and workout studio, this place is cleaner than some restaurants in town! The weights are also all rubberized. Some gyms, especially commercial gyms, do not have rubberized weights, so dropping them on the floor causes a lot of noise. Since they are rubberized here, it doesn't cause as much noise and it doesn't feel like you're bothering the other gym patrons. Finally, the keycard is a nice touch and is a reason why they can be open 24 hours a day. \n\nAlthough there are many pros, there are also a few cons. The biggest con being this gym is small. The workout studio is fairly small and can only fit a handful of people at a time. There is only one squat rack, one bench for bench pressing, and only one set of dumbbells (that go up to 100lbs?). If you're a serious body builder, this place could work for you, but you might have to wait for weights to free up if the gym is busy. If you're a serious Olympic weightlifter / power lifter / crossfitter, I don't recommend this place. Although the weights are rubberized, there is just no room to \"dump\" your weights if you happen to fail or succeed in a lift. There are also some equipment and cable attachments that are not available in this gym. But they do listen to patrons, and they are adding more/different pieces of equipment!\n\nThey do have cardio equipment (treadmills, ellipticals, stair masters, etc.). I just haven't used them, so I can't give you a fair review. They're clean and brand new though! Same goes for the classes that they offer. I haven't been to any of them, so I can't give you an honest review of them as well. \n\nOverall, this is a really nice, small gym. This gym is perfect for beginner and intermediate lifters and people who just want a clean, friendly space to workout in. I definitely recommend it if you're on a budget. I will definitely be back.",

  "text": "The best spinning studio in phila for a number of reasons. It's like flywheel without the pretense. Don't get me wrong I love a good flywheel class but body cycle is like it's less culty little sister - and there are no arm workouts which let's be honest makes sense (if you're going to work out arms do it separately not during cardio! though it is a welcome break from interval sprints). Body cycle shares a studio with yoga and barre classes which is nice but it's got its own little area in the back and doesn't feel too crowded. Classes are at convenient times for the most part but there aren't any early afternoon which has been frustrating occasionally. The teachers are phenomenal and I never get bored during class - Robbie is one of my favorites. A notable difference from flywheel is no shoes provided so you either bring your own cycling shoes or wear sneakers and use their shoe cages (which I have found to be almost as good as clipping in though serious cyclers would probably disagree). It's a great workout and you'll leave sweaty but happy.",

  "text": "Cannot get enough. I started working out here because I hated not pushing myself enough at the gym. I wanted someone to help tone my body but have fun with it. Went to a class with a friend as a free trial and signed up as soon as the work out was over. Every day is different and pushes you in a different way. Billy is amazing with always changing it up and challenging you. Lindsey doesn't let you quit and helps my \"girlie\" areas. With Andrew you know you will get a good work out - and I find him to have good funny commentary.... not to mention he loves hooks! Today I got to work out with Ronez..... just a perfectly amazing class. He changed it up and had a lot of fun and encouragement throughout the class. If you are looking for a change you need to try Title Boxing Club at the Glendale location. The trainers are amazing and I am amped to go every chance I can (no matter how cozy my bed is!) I'm hoping to try some night classes in the near future to see what those trainers have to offer!",

  "text": "Was in yesterday 5 pieces of equipment had out of order signs. Went to use the leg press and it was broken. When I reported it to staff I was told..\" yeah we know about it, but we are out of out of order signs.\"  The cardio theater is a wreck and hasn't worked right in a year and a half. The place is always a bit over crowded. The front desk staff is usually very nice. I have never been in that I wasn't at least greeted with a smile or told \"good bye\" when I left.  I've only encountered a few of the personal trainers... They don't seem friendly at all and one of them is actually kind of a jerk. If you like a good front desk staff... And that's all that matters for you it's a nice place. But if you actually want to work out I would not suggest it.\n\n\nUpdate: went back today and some of the machines were being repaired. For the second time I tried the audio app that is supposed to work with the cardio theater. It completely earns the 1.5 star review. The sound quality is bad and the TVs do not align with the app.  After the review. I was contacted by the front desk manager... like I said before. Top notch front desk staff.",

I used to be a member here for several years, and since I was back in town I figured I'd stop by for the day for a 1-day visit. However, when I went to pay I was told the Day Pass price is $50?? As in 5-0, aka more than the cost of most monthly gym memberships for one day of working out. I thought that was a laughably high price, but the membership office confirmed it. \n\nTruly a terrible business model, since I have no problem spending $100+ on a monthly membership at a nice gym but you'd have to be nuts to drop $50 to go work out for a day.

  "text": "I really like the Center of Clayton for it's versatility. They have great courts for basketball and volleyball. Their pool is fantastic with 8 lanes in the main area and 2 more lanes in the recreational area, plus a fairly good-sized hot tub.  They also have a fairly good amount of aerobic work out equipment such as treadmills, bikes and others of the sort. Their weight room is really great and has a number of free weights and machines to really throw around some iron.\n\nHere's what I wish they would change.  There is no \"cross-fit\" type of area to do the very effective and very popular type of training. Body weight stuff is the way to go. Try throwing around your own weight to see how quickly you get into shape. Of course, you can do this on your own, but it's difficult because it requires a fairly significant amount of 'free\" space. \n\nAnother thing I don't care for is the additional cost of each and every class. If I want to do a spin class or a kettle bell class the cost is an additional $8-$15 PER CLASS. That doesn't make any sense at all. For this reason alone, I drop it to 3 stars. I used to belong to St. Louis Fitness Club when I lived in the Dogtown area. For $35 per month, for myself and my fiancee, got a great gym, great weights and classes. Tanning was even included if you cared.\n\nI am not a resident of Clayton. Of course, I live as close as a person can without being in their city limits, so I pay $55 per month and then up to $87 for a family pass. Now, don't get me wrong, the whole reason I left St. Louis Fitness Club was to find a great pool where I could swim laps. Yes, I found it, but that's pretty much all I'm getting with regards to working out. As I said, all other classes are at an extra cost. \n\nI did check out Wellbridge, but at $90+ a month their lap pool just wasn't going to cut it. \n\nI guess it's what you're looking to do that matters. I suppose for an extra $35 per month I could go back to STL Fitness, but they are not close to each other and that can be a pain when it's tough enough to get out and put in a workout.",

I highly reccomend morning spinning classes there because they re not too full and you can always get a bike and get your workout over with for the day!\n\nAlso, first class for new customers is free so definitely worth a try!",

  "text": "I'll premise this review by saying I'm not a gym rat, nor am I remotely interested in the fitness lifestyle. The only reason I joined this gym is because 1. I'm not getting any skinnier, younger or stronger 2. It's easy to access for me 3. Affordable.\n\nThe complex is clean, amply lit and organized. There are plenty of machines to use and I've felt that there were more than enough units to accompany the number of guests even when it's busy. There's a \"ladies only\" workout area which I think I'll check out more this week as the main floor CAN be intimidating, but that's mostly because I'm new and don't know what I'm doing. \n\nThe reason for such meager stars falls mostly on the staff. After joining, they ask that you schedule a physical fitness evaluation to see where you are, what your goals are and how to get there. Unfortunately for me, they left out the \"how to get the results you're looking for\" part. They essentially used that half hour of time to push their physical trainer program which is not included in the $15/month basic membership plan. At one point the trainer Kyle, said \"95% of the people here don't know what they're doing here.\" I thought, oh great, that means you're going to help me not be one of those people. Wrong. I left after my workout session feeling discouraged and without guidance. Instead, I now have to do homework on my own since the only way the trainers are going to walk me through some basic workouts is with more of my hard earned money. \n\nI would suggest to FRS to add the following question to their physical exam questionnaire; \"Have you ever been to a gym/when was the last time you spent time in a gym\" to get a better assessment of their members rather than assume just because we don't know what we are doing, we are willing to spend above and beyond our membership plan to achieve our goals.",

  "text": "My son, small for his age of 6, developed an awful habit of dealing with frustration by hitting.  So, naturally, I enrolled him in a class that would make his strikes more deadly! \n\nWell, no.  Actually, I discovered that other parents found help for their similarly-disposed children via the martial arts.  Many said that the emphasis on discipline and focus was the reason.  Others said it was their child's increased confidence.   Whichever reason, they were saying it worked, so I was intrigued.  But I was also cautious.  I didn't want this to become another \"you damn well are going to practice\" struggle, ending with an unused violin in the closet.  Or whatever the karate equivalent to that would be.  \n\nI discovered the website for Church's Karate Academy, and the price and length of the trial package was fantastic.  Low output of cash, two months, uniform included.  After that, you enroll at the regular monthly rate, or you walk away.  No strings.  Not bad!  I went to the studio with the intention of enrolling my son.  So glad I did!!  \n\nIf you go to the website expecting to find information about the studio, please don't be put off.  The website is flashy, but it's also a bit generic, offering reasons why studying the martial arts is a good choice but no sense of Master Church or his studio.   Frankly, the website feels like more of a sales pitch than much else, but that is not how Master Church himself is.  \n\nThe studio works like this.  Karate students are placed in a class group based on their age and expertise.  Master Church holds classes for each of those groups five or six days per week at regularly scheduled times.  You attend two of those classes per week, and he tracks this via an attendance card.  You do not have to commit to particular classes.  For example, if you can normally attend on Mondays and Wednesdays, but something comes up one Wednesday, you can go to the Monday and Friday class for your group instead.  Or, if you split custody, perhaps it's easier for Mom to take Kid on Tues and Wed but Dad to take kid on Wed and Sat.  No problem.  No need to tell Master Church in advance.  Just show up to whichever two classes per week for your group.  So flexible.  \n\nAs for Master Church, enough cannot be said about how great of a teacher he is.   It's obvious that he genuinely cares about and believes in them.  In return, they want to do well and can't stand the thought of disappointing him.  He's that kind of teacher.  If you have ever had such a teacher yourself, you know their magic.  He is firm, though, not a push over, and he has their respect for that. I eventually even enrolled a certain violin quitter, and she loves it. \n\nWhat's more?  I honestly cannot remember the last time my son hit me, although I'm sure I'm just as frustrating as ever.",

Most members do not wipe equipment down when finished. I moved away from the area and needed to cancel. Even though the contract states to give written notice 10 days prior to the next billing cycle, Crunch Fitness Hillsborough will only accept this notice in person. Imagine moving out of area, and having to come back in person to cancel a $9.95 per month membership? I have been emailing at length with the manager, and he/she still refuses to cancel my membership. I have been a member since the gym opened, I actually transferred from another Crunch when I moved closer to this location shortly before it opened. I typically move every year or two for work, and I have never had more difficulties cancelling any gym membership, cable/internet agreement, electrical, water, other utilities, etc than the Crunch Fitness on Hillsborough.",

  "text": "This reviews the BJJ discipline at this place. This place is the cleanest Brazilian Jiu Jitsu academy in the world! When you walk in the front door you will see exactly what I am talking about. The mat space is also one of the biggest I have ever seen at a BJJ gym. Franjinha and Sean's teaching styles compliment each other so that students get the best of both worlds. What I really like about their styles is that you can train as a hobbyist or you can also train like BJJ is your life. They also have a great kids program. The kids instructors understand what kids need and want. From the moment you walk in this place you will be welcomed here like it is your own. Franjinha (the founder) has always been a true leader and has perpetuated this philosophy to his students. In every class there are extremely talented BJJ players to train with. If you come on the right day, you may get to roll with world renowned athletes like Jeff Glover or Bill Cooper. These guys will leave you wondering what just happened. Keep an eye out for this school, they have been opening up locations in California, Texas, and Sweden and continue to be on the podium stands at the high level international/national tournaments. Go check it out and see for yourself.",

Without discounts, the month-to-month price is around $75\n-Some of the equipment is getting rather long in the tooth, a problem that I find compounded by the cost of membership\n-I'd personally prefer more squat racks (the only one they have now is difficult to adjust)\n\nWhile Reno's high-quality gym offerings are pretty slim, Saint Mary's is a solid option with a lot to offer.

It's not that they were bad before but I can see how they needed the upgrade.\n\nI did spinning classes, boxing, circuit classes, pilates, swimming and general weight training.  I even tried yoga a couple of times which was awesome because it was in a private yoga studio, not a room with the lights dim.  The yoga studio was tranquil and even though I ended up hurting myself, I still enjoyed it.  I just don't think I'm the yoga type.\n\nThe website went a bit wonky from time to time when I tried to look at class schedules.  That's a minor complaint in my book.  I was able to take advantage of a special offer when I joined so I beat the initiation fee which is outrageous by the way.  Still, they offer specials and will let you train for a few days to see what you think of it.\n\nI really liked working out here and I hope that a gym near my new place will be even half as good as the bellevue.

I like a workout class and some structure but I can commit to a class time. So when I heard about round9 - 30 minutes, full body workout, 9 different stations 3 minutes each - I had to try it. \n\nTo start, you get hand wraps and gloves, a quick how to wrap and you are off. First to stations are strength training...squats with medicine balls, push-ups, etc...then to good stuff....the next 6 stations you jab, cross, kick and speed bag you way thru an intense workout that leave you wondering how long 3 minutes really is. Punching and kicking while trying to stay coordinated is great and it goes by super quick. The staff was super motivational. When Josh, the owner,  saw I was really struggling around round 6, he mixed it up a bit to keep me going (and it worked)! I will admot though - when the buzzer rang at the end of my ninth round I was stoked I was done! That was awesome.\n\nIf you want a full body workout, no class time, and like to sweat, this is for you!

The music he picked was fantastic and I actually enjoyed that you could see your ranking in the class. Puts a little fire under your ass. Like most spin classes this is not a cheap form of exercise. They have an intro package of 3 classes for $29 which I picked up that day. I was lucky enough to notice that on St. Patty's day they had a 4 pack of classes for $40.

There are great trainers who are so impressive in their athletic abilities that it's easy to be in awe of them--but they are so personable and down to earth that they really make you feel like they want to help you on your fitness journey.\n\nI like the format of the varied classes. You know you're in for a hard workout no matter what you choose. There's good music and before you know it, the hour is done and you've undoubtedly burned a ton of calories, cleansed your body of toxins, and sweated through all over.\n\nI've taken boot camp, spin classes, hiit, tone, strength, tabata, and their afterburn classes. My goal was to be going 2-3 times a week, but I've found myself going 5-6 times because the classes are so addictive, easy to schedule, and fun. \n\nI definitely recommend it.",

  "text": "Plus side:  A lot of people go here because it's inexpensive.  You can negotiate a monthly price that works for you.  There are classes, but you have to pay more.  Not a huge variety, but something may be at the right time that may work for you.  There are lockers to lock your items up and there's child care.  Nice employees, but there is turnover which is typical.\nNegative:  It's not kept very clean which is gross at times.  It's very dusty, especially the walls, exposed pipes/fans on the ceiling.  Mainly the bikes are not working at their best and need maintenance.  There's paper towels and spray that your supposed to clean your machines with, but it would be nice if they went back to towels or employees could step up the cleaning.  Billing as stated in previous reviews can be a problem, but just try to give notice.",

  "text": "TO SUM IT UP: DO NOT JOIN - AWEFUL, HORRIBLE STAFF, Classes change all the time without notice, Calendar is never updated correctly,  ALWAYS uncomfortably hot, basically they lie and scam you to sign up and don't hold the end of their bargain.  \n\nI have been going to the King of Prussia Sweat Fitness for about 3 months now and every time I think it will get better it just gets worse and worse.  At first I thought it was just me and I was expecting too much but as time went on and I spoke with other members, I realized they all felt the same way but they were STUCK with their memberships for a year.  I will start by saying that customer service is horrible at this gym.  The 2 ladies in the front are rude and don't even bother going to them with an issue because they don't have the slightest clue as to how to go about dealing with it.  I don't want to write too much so here are all my issues in a nutshell: \n\n1.) The Gym is SO HOT that it's very uncomfortable to work out, you start sweating just standing there and they don't allow you to open the doors. \n\n2.) I do spinning every week and in the past 3 months, I already have seen 3 bikes break, 2 bikes wobble so you have to put a magazine underneath to be able to balance and not fall in the middle of the class.  \n\n3.) They change the schedule of the classes and DO NOT update the calendars, so basically you leave work to go to a class and it was a waste of your time because Denise up front filled out the calendar incorrectly and when you show concern she could care less.\n\n4.) I wanted to use the jump rope yesterday and there were only TWO for the entire gym.  A guy was using one and the other one was BROKEN.  The answer front desk gave me was \" I don't know where they are, we had 3 this morning.\" \n\n5.) If you have concerns, you have to talk to the girl who washes the towels and is on the phone all day.  Basically you're screwed if you have any issues and you're stuck for a year.  \n\n6.) I've had a friend try a free trial and when he called to cancel after the 21 days, they ended up signing him for a full year and charged his card.  \n\nIf they expect us to pay our monthly memberships in full and on time, I expect the same treatment back.  I expect everything that I was promised when they were trying to convince me to sign up.\n\nBest part is, when you tell them your issues, they show no concern or a solution and make sure they tell you if you try to cancel they will continue charging your credit card and will send you to collections.  If you want to be associated with a company that threatens you that they're going to report you to collections instead of trying to work with you to resolve your concerns, then join at your own risk.",

  "text": "The Sporting Club at the Bellevue was easily the best gym that I visited in center city while I was deciding where to get my gym membership. The location is a bit quirky, on the 8th floor of a parking structure, but the gym itself is very spacious. \n\nThe membeship staff were very helpful in getting me set up, the shoe-shiner across from the membership office is very nice and good at his job, the gym includes an indoor pool and basketball courts and ellipticals for days... the list goes on!\n\nThere are 4 floors for exercising- the first floor is the locker rooms, showers, pool, and cafe/restaurant. The second floor has the boxing ring, squash courts, a basketball court, and aerobics rooms. The third floor is the main fitness gym, with a lot of workout machines, ellipticals, treadmills, rowing machines, and free weights. The top floor is a baby version of a track, where 12 laps around the area equates to 1 mile.\n\nThe people here are generally friendly (except when the basketball games get super competitive). I don't feel like I'm being judged while I work out, which is a big plus, and signing up gets you a few discounts and perks for personal trainers, which is nice.\n\nLastly, the locker room is pretty nice as well. There are hundreds of lockers, and you can pretty much find every essential item that a locker room needs. \n\nI've been really happy with my decision to join the Sporting Club at the Bellevue, and I'd encourage anybody looking for a gym in center city to strongly consider this gym. The higher price is justified in my opinion, and they often do deals where you get 1 month free when you sign up as well!",

  "text": "I've been a member at SRAC for 3 years. I love this place. It might not be right for everyone, but I'll note down what keeps me a regular and extremely happy member:\n\n-You can virtually always get on whatever equipment you wish to use, even during primetime hours. The parking lot may appear at times to be overrun, but a lot of those people are present for leagues, so don't let it scare you that the rest of the gym is overcrowded and you'll be sitting around, waiting for things to open up.\n\n-I work out all the time during the boot camp classes. Sometimes I even work out in the same space they use downstairs. I've never had any problems. I used to be a trainer for many years and don't feel these guys overstep their bounds at all. I don't think they monopolize the track for long periods of time either.\n\n-The customer service of the owners and staff is fantastic. In 3 years, I've never witnessed any bad behavior on their part personally. Karl and Gabe always know you by name. They talk with members and get to know them. The few complaints or problems I've had (minimal) have been met with quick and friendly response. The only staff member I felt had a problem with good service was their billing/accounting person. I talked to the GM and he took care of it within hours. Fantastic! Their front desk staff is trained to greet you, say goodbye when you leave, smile, and be friendly. Big points in my book. \n\n-If you are into functional training, this place is full of all the cutting edge equipment and the necessary space to use it. The indoor track rocks too. If you prefer traditional stuff, they have all that as well.\n\n-Their operating hours seem quite reasonable to me. Gyms are not going to stay open til midnight if the traffic they receive doesn't drive it. If you need to work out after 10pm or before 5am, another gym would be a better option for you.\n\n-Most of their long term, regular trainers seem well educated and up-to-date and good at what they do (as I have a degree in the field and worked in the business for a long time, I know how to rate what I see). I've never seen any of the men leer or sexually harass ANYONE (per another review here). I am a young and fairly fit female and have never had ANY such problems.",

  "text": "As a gym, I give this place 5 stars. It's impeccably clean, beautiful, modern, and gives a lux feel. The bathrooms are spacious and clean, with tons of lockers, and every kind of toiletry available for your disposal. There is a regular sauna and a eucalyptus infused sauna, as well as a hot tub in the bathroom. They have showers, sinks, dressing stations. Outside the bathrooms are a Pilates studio, a cycle studio, 2 fitness studios, a childcare center, a cafe, a business center AND a beauty salon! Creme de la creme of gyms. And the best part- it's not super crowded, even at 6pm! \n\nNow. Their yoga classes. The studio is gorgeous and gives a serene feel. I took the Monday even hot yoga class and expected to take class with LeSean, who I have heard great things about, but she unfortunately had a sub. I personally hated the class and could not WAIT to leave. The flow was extremely confusing, the teacher did not model any postures, and the weirdest part was that she would teach the flow once, then turn on the music FULL blast while do tried to remember how to do it yourself. And when I say full blast- I mean like night club level. It was weird and ridiculous. 1 star for that experience. I also have taken their \"surrender\" class and thought it would be more of a restorative practice, but it ended up being yin. The teacher Vivian had a soothing cam voice and was composed during that practice but I honestly didn't love it. This place kind of validated that gym yoga isn't legit (to me).",

  "text": "Philly Dance Fitness has been on my to-do list for a while because if you haven't noticed, I have commitment issues when it comes to gyms/fitness. (Life philosophy: Try ALL the things!)\n\nWent for Zumba with Jamie Wednesday, checked out their new studio, and had a great time! The studio is on the 2nd floor of nest (entrance on 13th street, not locust like the address says). Jamie was awesome and the class was a good workout, but 50 minutes felt so short! Also, the vibe of the class was a little womp womp, not as fun/exciting as other fitness classes I've been to, maybe because it's new and people are still getting to know each other. Hopefully that'll change. Also, right now it's carpeted and looks like a little kids play gym (which it is) but if there's interest, they'll put in hardwood floors and make it more legit.\n\nThis is not a pretentious, super intense place. This class is definitely fine for people new to Zumba, but will still be a good workout for others. Having gone to Koresh a few days before, I will say that this place is more fitness than dance. The routines are simple, with more emphasis on workout than performance. As far as difficulty, I'd rank Jamie's class as slightly easier than the cardio classes I've taken at Thrive, but on par with Sweat (actually, Timaree teaches at Sweat and here and I love her!), the Sporting Club at the Bellevue, and 12th street gym (like I said, can't commit).\n\n$10 dropin is SUPER reasonable, and their class cards are only $40 for 5 and $70 for 10 and you can go to all their locations. Definitely great for people who like to mix it up!\n\n$5 off coupon if you sign up for their emails (so, $5 class!) Recommend checking them out! This location will only stay if there's interest.",

  "text": "Saint Mary's Fitness Center is interestingly located!\n\nSo this gym is connect to Saint Mary Hospital. But you can get a membership here even if you do have any association with the hospital via your a client, work at the hospital, or in patient. You can get a membership here. \n\nLet's talk you through the staff. Staff is great and very accommodating. The entrance by the way is on the first floor. The people are friendly and everyone is pretty happy with the status of the facility. The facility is well kept and the cleaning staff seems to be making rounds during the rush hours. Which is a good sign that this facility is pretty clean and it is. I have mainly used the lap pool and it's pretty clean. So, I am happy with the facility and its staff. They are good at what they do. \n\nNow for the parking. That can get pretty crazy because they share the parking with Saint Mary Hospital. Which during the regular work day it gets busy and it can be a bit tough to find parking but not impossible. Just keep that in mind when you are looking for parking here. With that said I came here during 4pm-5pm to find parking and I found parking on the second floor just find. \n\nThis place isn't for people on a budget. It is on the higher price range. But for what you get it is pretty good. I will explain this. So they have 3 floors. The first floor has a lap pool, lockers, staff/checkin area and importantly a baby sitting area. For those of you with kids. This is a great day care that is conveniently located in the gym (1st floor). They have a great staff there and they do a great job watching your kids. I would recommend them if your looking to get back into shape and need a baby sitter. No more excuses they have a day care here. So, I stated earlier about the price this day care is worth the extra money in my opinion. I have talked with the day care staff and they are very nice. So some of the rules are 2 hours max for infants and 3 hours max for toddlers. Also if they need you back for anything they have a beeper they give you in case your child really needs you. Also, they don't do diapers changes they will call you back for that. But this place is pretty awesome. I would recommend them. Thank you for reading my review.",

Ok, that was to be expected.  I was a member for about a year and a half and the only two reasons I left were because first the traffic made it so annoying that half of the time i did not even want to go.  I worked in Philly and would take 70 East bound, having to make that cross over 70W with no light.... you could age 5 years waiting for a break in the traffic during rush hour.  The other reason was their hours were just not late enough for me.  They close at 11pm on the week days and though that's pretty late, I still need something that is open later - so I went to cancel my membership.  First I called, they said please come in.  I went in, they said you need to speak to the manager he wont be back until Monday, come back Monday.  I came back Monday and the guy gave me the third degree and actually became nasty.  Can I just cancel?  Can you do that for me???  Are you the manager?  Yes???? GREAT!!!  I don't want to be a member here anymore, I don't need the third degree or the drama or the 'tude!  \nSad, this is a really beautiful gym with a TON of good stuff going for it, they could do better with their exit strategy.

This is a relatively small gym, I think the smallest of the 3 locations of all Upper Limits. However there is a variety of routes for beginners, regulars and beyond. I started at 5.6 and am slowly but surely making progress. It's challenging to take on a new route and rewarding when you complete a project. There are patrons of all ages here. It's definitely a fun activity that I'll continue to keep up with in 2021.\n\nThe gym is taking measures during the pandemic -- Mandatory mask wearing, handwashing before you climb, spraying stuff down after, and limited capacity. I feel pretty safe here. \n\n**PRO TIP: Check out this brilliant, real-time occupancy tracker while planning your visit, so you know for sure you can get a spot at the gym at any time of any day. https://stlmo.io",

The change I have seen in my son's surfing level as well as self confidence is phenomenal. My son went from riding a 7'2\" board to a 5'0\" in 9 months. He has been instructed on how to position himself in the line up for maximum wave catching. I can honestly say he is now entering into the intermediate / advanced level after only 9 months of coaching. There is no turning back for him, he is a surfer for life.\n\nMatt Coleman is as much as a mentor to my son as much as a coach. He is truly invested in my son reaching his potential as a person. He has taught my son to reach for his personal best and to stay far away from comparing himself to others. He has also taught him the very valuable trait of staying humble, even when your ripping. At the very heart of Matt's philosophy on teaching surf is to have more fun then anyone else in the line up...thats the key to success.\n\nI would recommend LoveWaterSurf to anyone at any level of surfing. Matt is an incredible role model for teens and young adults.",

They haven't gotten the body enhancement/ red light therapy to work yet but will sometime this week :)) and they also have tanning beds, massage chairs and hydro massages. And lots of fitness equipment!!! I also discovered the Stretching Cage. so cool!\n\nPros:\n- Open 24/7\n- Offer fitness classes (Monday through Friday)\n- Have cardio equipment- elliptical, bike, treadmill\n- Have a TON of strengthening and toning machines\n- Have weights\n- Really friendly staff\n- Super cheap! (Regular is $10/ month and Black card is $20/ month)\n- Its accessible - on Charlotte Pike, 5 minutes from West End Ave, across from Kroger's and Kroger's gas station, and near a bunch of things\n- They answer the phone line promptly\n- Free purple pens and tootsie rolls!\n- Black card member benefits- Tanning beds, Body enhancement vibration therapy, hydromassages, massage chairs, and can bring 1 guest\n- Lockers in bathroom areas and there are showers\n- No parking issues (yet...)\n\nCons\n- Driveway tricky to get in the first time (at night...)\n- Their webpage isn't up to date yet (and their twitter, Facebook isn't setup)\n- With starting up- some tanning and vibration machines aren't working yet\n- No mirrors in tanning rooms\n- Direct withdrawal from debit card only (not credit card or cash)",

They have student packages which are really reasonable. \n\nStudio is located above Breakaway Bikes, and it's a really nice space. I like that the bikes have the monitor on them telling you what resistance you are at and how fast you are going. The instructors will often refer to what RPM and resistance number range you should be in. This allows for you to push yourself harder than you would normally, since you can see how much slower (in my case) that you are going compared to the number they are giving you. Also, I definitely use more resistance using these bikes!  Studio uses the black lights and when it's dark outside, it's dark in the studio. Little clip on lights on the bikes let you see the monitors.\n\nThey provide towels, coat rack, cubbies, bathroom. They sell water and some other things, but there is also a water cooler for filling up bottles.\n\nSo far I have taken from Jessica and Shoshana. I found their classes to be very challenging!",

This was my first time doing cycle bar and I loved it!\n\nThe staff was very welcoming and showed me how to check in, where to find the clip in shoes, the lockers and got me all set up on my bike. \n\nOnce the ride started the music was awesome and the time passed before I knew it. The instructors are really motivating and reassure you to go at your own pace. Sometimes workout studios can be intimidating but this is a no judgement zone with a \"you do you\" attitude. \n\nI really like how they send your stats along with the playlists after class.",

One of the front desk employees who is especially rude parks in the handicap spot WHEN HE IS NOT HANDICAPPED nor does he have a sticker to park there. Same guy also made a rude remark about my hair when I walked in one day and decided to say hello to them since they were so absorbed in their own conversation and couldn't do their job properly. I have watched these \"personal trainers\" walk into the gym with fast food... like you've got to be kidding me  there is only one person who has ever made me feel welcome at this gym and that's one of the actual personal trainers, not the one eating fast food and showing poor form to his client.  \nI can't explain how important it is to make your clients feel welcome and comfortable and that is the staffs job.

The new studio space is beautiful, with screens so you can still see the instructor's moves even from the back.  They have a great variety of classes: Zumba, Bombay Jam, Beat HIIT, PiYo, Yoga, Barre classic, Barre Pump, and 305.  Some of these classes are hard to find anywhere else or aren't offered in gyms nearby.  I've taken all of these except Yoga and I really enjoy them all.  It's a great variety of cardio and strength training.  The instructors are fantastic.  Each one is friendly and welcoming.  They make a point of asking if anyone is new and they show modifications.  What I also appreciate is that there are all body types and fitness levels, so it's not intimidating.",

Once I did, I pretty much booked that same hotel so I could have an awesome workout here.\n\nCoach Pepper is encouraging, understanding, and actually *coaches* you on technique and form (and for me -- being so new, this was important). I knew that when on one of my first two days there, my shoulder was bothering me -- he took me off the floor and put me on crossover symmetry right away (v. familiar with) ... that's when I knew that this would be my gym for as long as I was in Tampa.\n\nThe athletes here are very friendly and welcoming, and the camaraderie is great. \n\nI'm not sure what my future CF holds in my hometown of CLT as I'm worried I won't find another place like CFDH.

  "text": "Bringing your kiddos here is one of the best things that you could do for them. Playformance is more than just another kids' gym: Kevin (\"Coach Kevin\" as he is affectionately referred to) incorporates exercise with character building, nutrition lessons, friendship, and good old-fashioned play. Our kids have attended Playformance's after school programs and summer camps for years, and they LOVE it. My oldest two daughters don't have a sporty bone in their bodies and loathe exercise, but Kevin's gym was the exception - I never dreamed those two would ever be able to climb walls or shimmy several feet up a rope and touch a vaulted ceiling, but the encouragement they received here was highly motivational. Your child's physical development will blossom here, no matter what fitness level they are at. Some kids come here during their \"off-season\" to cross train and keep fit, while for others, this may be the only form of physical activity they get. All of the coaches at Playformance are wonderful - they truly care about the kids and they clearly have a blast playing with them. \n\nKevin runs a variety of programs, including after school, Saturday Parkour, summer and other school break camps, and \"parent night out\" events (where you can drop you child off for a couple hours and head next door to Borderlands for a beer). He also hosts birthdays and team building parties (for both kids and adults). Kevin has an entrepreneurial spirit, so if you have an idea for some type of fitness and/or play related event, he will try to make it work. \n\nWhat child couldn't use a bit more play in their lives?",

Lots of equipment, but some was in need of repair. I tried the calf extension and the metal plate I was standing on came off. That was the deciding factor which prevented me from joining. \n\nI think this is a great gym if you're a bodybuilder and train during off hours.

  "text": "This was my 8th summer attending classes at the Monon Center. I love aqua classes and the water park is a great place for them! \nThe aqua teachers are top notch and they really care. I attend 2-4 days a week. The walking track is a great easy workout and I love Deep Water classes. I also love Aqua Zumba and a new class to me was Aqua-yo-lates, which is pilates and yogo in the water! I love it and am sad they only have it on Friday mornings. \nI wish they would have more outdoor classes. New this year was a night time outdoor Aqua Zumba and it was great! The water park closes at 7, so I wish they would offer more night and weekend options for people work. My schedule at work changed and I can't get there as often as I would like and that makes me sad. The day classes are very busy and I think outdoor night could be just as busy. \nCommunication with the Monon still is just absolutely awful. I prefer to not even bother interacting with the staff as they never actually know what is going on. I think this is a high level training issue and it's just not gotten better. \nThis summer when the indoor pool closed for maintenance they decided to not move classes outdoors.  I am not sure why. The park is now closed during the days. Tuesday night I tried to go to class at 6 and followed the email that said classes were being held outdoor. We did have to go inside even though the email said the gates would be open. I asked and they told us classes were outside. But when I asked outside which pool the lifeguard was unsure. 2 people inside told us to go out. 7 of us showed up for class, but another woman doing laps said the teacher told them they canceled them. A super helpful girl came over and said that they showed class was happening and she wasn't sure where the instructor was and she went off to make a phone call. About 20 min later she came back and said they were not having classes. We ended up just jogging in a lane the 6 of us who stayed. \nOne woman just joined yesterday and was told class was tonight. She said she specifically told them she joined for nighttime aqua classes. Yet the pool is closed for 2 weeks?!! They told her classes were going to be outside. They always move outside. But not this year, but no one was told I guess. \nAnother guy did come out and he apologized again and said he guesses they didn't update the daily notes and schedule. \nI am just not sure how things like that happen. The Monon Center is a multi-million dollar facility and very nice, but very poorly managed.",

  "text": "I have been looking for new ways to get into shape. I've done everything from spinning to yoga. I saw a living social for Rowzone and thought I would give it a shot. \n\nI arrived 15 minutes early to learn the ropes, as instructed, and was able to catch a few minutes of the class before mine. I must saw I was a bit intimidated by the sweat dripping off the people in that class. But the diversity of their fitness levels gave me hope. I am definitely not in the best of shape so seeing people that looked to be at my fitness level was encouraging. \n\nJess was the instructor for the day and she gave me a run down of the machine, what the correct form was, and watched me use it a few times to correct any mistakes. Then it was time for class.\n\nWe started with a circuit that was easy to follow and Jess kept me encouraged to keep pushing myself. I think that the 1st 15 minutes were the hardest. Gettin the rhythm of the correct form started to get me a bit frustrated, but Jess came over to help me correct my mistakes. \n\nI was really in the zone at this point and she tells us to hop off the machine. We broke up the middle of the class with some elevated push ups, planks, and supermans. I really was feeling the burn!\n\nThe it was time for the last stretch of the class, everyone was pushing them selves, the music had me pumped, we finished the last 2 sets and it was over. It was really the fastest 45 minutes I've ever had working out. Normally I am counting the seconds until I am out of these types of classes.\n\nI was dripping at this point too, but I felt amazing. Everyone of my muscles felt engaged and exhausted. I would highly recommend Rowzone to anyone who is looking for a fast and efficient full body workout. I loved it so much, despite my still sore muscles, I will be going back tonight!",

  "text": "Does the term, \"Greasy sales tactics\" resonate with anyone? If so, this is what you can expect when going to LA Fitness. Particularly the one on Ina/Shannon. \n\nHere's how my experience panned out. I get several  calls from a guy who claims to be the general manager named Clinton J.  I finally call the guy back and tell him I'll sign up that day, but that I'm not going to pay an initiation fee. He replies, \"No problem. Come on in. We'll work something out for you.\" I then replied, \"Are you sure you can waive the initiation fee because I'm not going to pay it and I don't want you to waste my time or yours?\"  He said he was sure and so I decided to ignore my intuition which said, \"They're like used car salesman...they probably won't do what they said.\"\n\nAt any rate, I decided to enter the lion's den. The greeter greets me and is very friendly. I am then taken to a waiting area behind where all the sales vermin reside. As I'm sitting there, I actually heard Clinton tell his sales team and VP who happened to be there. \"You all ready to see how this is done?!\" Then Clinton comes around the corner and greets me with his VP who says his name is also Clint.  \n\nLong story short, I sit down at Clinton's desk and he says he's going to see what he can do and starts looking at his computer's screen like as if he doesn't already know what deals he can offer. I then tell him I'm only interested in the single club monthly rate with no initiation fee as I'm not going to pay one. He then abruptly gets up, shakes my hand and tells me that plan doesn't exist. \n\nAll this could've been avoided if the dude was just honest. Instead, he wasted my time, his time, his VP's time and all that sales staff who were all listening to how \"it's done.\" Now I'm going to post this review on ever site I can to let people know what to expect at LA Fitness.\n\nBy the way, I echo what all the other reviews have said about how it takes LA Fitness forever to stop charging you once you've cancelled. I sent two certified letters to their corporate office and made countless calls before they stopped charging me. Why I thought they would have changed by now is beyond me.",

  "text": "The sporting club at the Bellevue is everything I need in a gym! I started off lifting weights and they have 4 Squat & Power racks which is very respectable for a mainstream gym. They have platforms for Olympic power lifts. They have air strike bikes. Anyone that knows anything about bodybuilding and weightlifting should be excited by what I just wrote. Usually there's only one or two squat racks and rarely will you ever see a platform in a mainstream gym.\n\nTheir hours are also that of a true athlete's gym. There are some commercial gyms out there like Weston Fitness that will close at 3:30 p.m. on a weekend. The sporting club is open until 11 p.m. on most nights. To go along with the hours is the fact that the pool is open for the same time as the gym. I believe it's a junior olympic size pool and it can fit 8 swimmers.\n\nAside from swimming and weightlifting I also practice Muay Thai and boxing. Their boxing studio is top notch. Trust me I've worked out all over this city from City Fitness to the now-defunct 12th Street Gym to Temple University's gym. Sporting club has it all. Also they have a great view and a little lounge with Pure Fare food there. \n\nAsk for employer discounts. I'm an Einstein employee and I get a significant discount. My friend who works at Comcast also gets a significant discount.\n\nAsk them for their free 7-Day trial. Also members are given 4 three day guest passes so maybe you can meet someone and they can let you into the gym to experience all of it.\n\nMy cons are that it is an outdated looking gym and I have bad service in there.",

  "text": "Horrible cancelation experience; LA Ftiness of Mt. Laurel does not deserve any stars. Please be aware once you complete the LA Fitness requested form to cancel your gym membership they will call you everyday and send emails atleast twice per week to collect billing. It's unfortunate they spend that much time calling someone that has not used their facility in over 6 months. They should take that same energy for calling to collect to make sure their members utilize a service they pay for.\n\nLA Fitness should do a better job with their level of service instead of lying and stating the cancelation form was never recieved. That is not an ethical way to do business and makes the company look dishonest. They leave messages about the representatives needing to make their commisions. They also e-mail a confirmation that the cancelation was received.",

I like that there are 3 huge projectors while you ride so you can go along with the music and also feel bad about yourself that you dont look like Beyonce in the music videos- I guess that's kind of the point.

  "text": "I have to update my review. I've been a member of about 8 months now. It is hands down the best gym in philly. Which is why I guess I continue to go. However being the best compared to terrible gyms doesn't make it amazing. At first I was obsessed. But lately it has been so crowded it's hard to deal with. I used to love working out in the mornings getting ready at the gym then going to work. That's the reason I joined such an expensive gym, was to have a nice locker room. However, if I do that there's no where to get ready. I wait to find a spot to put on makeup and try to blow dry my hair. It's way too crowded for only about 10 stations to get ready at. Also the classes are super crowded. If you don't book it right away you can't get into any of the good ones. It's been so frustrating. \n\nAnd on top of it they change their perks without explaining. When I joined a perk was free PSN sports teams. It's one of the reasons I was ok with the price. I join and email about how it works and I'm told \"they no longer do that\" without any explanation. I emailed back to ask why and when this occurred because it's one of the reasons I joined and no one has responded to me ever. It's been over a month. \n\nIt's the best of what's around but I don't think it's worth the cost. To top off all of my issues I just received a letter they're raising the monthly fee. It's only by a few dollars but it's the principal. So frustrated but unfortunately in philly there's no where else to go. So that's why it's so popular. The best of what's around by far as far as facilities, etc. but they make it hard to enjoy sometimes.",

  "text": "It's true, there's pretty much nothing I can think of that's bad about the spin classes here. I've only been to 3 classes, three different instructors, both great, but Jessica Sullivan's class was the best cardio class (not just spin class) I've ever tried. From the beginning, she was helpful and friendly, but I really appreciated her adamance about form throughout the class. She didn't just say \"no bouncing,\" but explained how to not bounce so that we don't injure ourselves. (I'm a newbie to spinning.)\n\nThe studio is clean, not overcrowded, towels and water available, well ventilated, the equipments are new. \n\nThe only drawback is the schedule of classes. There are hardly weekend classes (no afternoons), and the times are not consistent during the week, so for many of us who have a set work schedule, there's only 1 class I can attend the whole week.\n\n...and if Jessica teaches more evening classes, that would be ideal!",

It's a good thing they were only three of us taking the class today. It was kind of awkward for me. Least favorite class I've taken so far from class pass and I didn't feel it matched the class description well. It was branded as a high energy Bey/Nikki/RiRi HIIT class but it seemed more like barre class with hit song's playing softly in the background. I did break a good sweat though, so...Mission Accomplished! I got in a good workout but it wasn't fun or engaging so I'll try somewhere else",

Cheese, only less Vegas-slot-machine-like, and slightly more expensive. There were only two crazy cars that were operational during the party, so the kids stood in line and took turns basically spinning around in circles. They all enjoyed the laser tag. My son and the other kids seemed to be having a wonderful time at the birthday party, and the service provided to the party was great...I wish I could give this review 2.5 stars for that.\n\nhe biggest drawback however, and for me it was *BIG*, was the music. It was very loud (for any time, much less a Saturday morning), and entirely inappropriate for a place catering to children. It felt like I was in a nightclub in Ybor, and was annoyed and a little shocked by it.",

  "text": "Terrible experience trying for free Trial!\n\nI got an email below once i signed up for free trial. It clearly says \"no obligation\" basically hassle free but once i called and spoke to someone it sounds the opposite (see email quote below). \n\n1. First email: \n\"\nThank you for signing up for a free, no obligation, 7-day trial at Any time Fitness. To arrange a visit during staffed hours, please contact the gym at the phone number or email address below. Then show this email when you visit the gym. See you soon!\n\" \n2. Email asks for much more than no obligation experience: Deposit $$ and proof of residency. \n\n\"\nWe would be happy to get you set up with a 7 day trial pass, which you would be able to use the gym any time of the day 24x7 throughout the seven day period. This is a free pass which does require a $49.00 deposit on a credit card for your security key which would be refunded in full at the end of the seven days when you return the key. We accept Visa, MasterCard and AMEX. You must be at least 18 years of age. We do not accept cash or check. We will make a copy of your AZ driver's license.\n\nIf you have just moved here and your license does not show Tucson, we will need proof that you are a local resident to honor this offer, i.e. a local driver's license, utility bill, etc. Free trials are not available for students, but we do offer a Student Summer Special and Winter Special with a student ID and key purchase.\n\"",

It seems like I was not signed up properly originally by one of the reps and every time I come in there is a problem with my account, stating that I have not signed all the agreements although I've signed all the paperwork and billing information well before this place even opened and on top of that l actually found out they had signed me up for the wrong membership. This doesn't actually make a difference as there's not really any regulation between memberships, so even with a regular base membership you're able to use the HIIT zone, weights and take group classes for the most part. \n\nOne of the reasons why I signed up for the Peak Results membership was the ability to use the tanning and hydromassage, however it doesn't seem like they have even set this up. The facility is clean and the equipment is very nice however with them unable to resolve my account problems and incorrectly signing me up, even though they claimed to have fixed it when I originally signed up, I'm not sure if I'll continue coming here.",

  "text": "I've worked out at the Spring Garden location for a couple years now. This was an awesome gym and the price was right. The trainers were/are still great. But slowly the entire atmosphere started to change. They lost a couple of there best trainers to start. No big deal since they still had solid ones remaining. Then the green turf was laid out to promote a new type of training. This is where City Fitness started to go wrong. If you didn't pay for personal training, you started to get corralled in one section of the gym. Then they put in an awesome 7 rack pullup station similar to what you'd have at a cross fit gym. Even if no training session is going on, regular members can't use the rack. I can see if it is crowded or a class is taking place but an empty station really? Increasingly it is becoming the few \"paid trainer\" folks sprawled out in one area and the many \"non paid trainer\" folks crowded in the rest of the gym. Not cool no matter how many pool parties you throw. The regulars are the reason this gym is even popular. Don't forget that. Getting told I could not use the pull up bars (in the middle of a set no less) was my final straw. Today was my last day. The 3 stars are a remnant of its glory days. Felt like a 2 start gym today but that wouldn't be fair.",

My gym back home was similar (actually not as nice!) and $40/mo more with very limited usage (outside with masks) during COVID.  I see some negative reviews here about the fees but the amenities, size of the facility, cleanliness, etc. are worth the membership to me.  My only frustration is the classes fill up FAST...it seems I may have to set an alarm the day registration opens for the early morning spin classes.  That being said, my solo workouts have been seamless and I've never had to wait for a machine...maybe a bench on occasion.",

  "text": "I did not have a good experience at this location and will not be back. After signing up for a membership online I came into the Charlotte Pike location to work out for the first time. When I walked in there were several people already standing around so I waited until a guy at the counter called out to me. I told him that I was new and that I had just signed up online. I assumed I needed to get a membership card for my key chain so I asked for one. Not that I expected the red carpet rolled out or anything, but the guy barely acknowledged me, gave me my card and sent me on my way...No welcome, No tour...Just gave me my card and moved on to whatever he was doing. I explored the gym by myself which wasn't that big of a deal and did my workout. I laughed to myself because they have a sign on the wall that talks about what they do for new members...none of which they offered when I walked in. Anyway....\n\nWhen I was done walking around I noticed they had the hydro beds and I wanted to try one out. So I go up to the same guy at the counter. He was standing alone with no other customers around. I kindly asked him if I could use a hydro bed and he said they were all taken. He offered me the hydro chair. I said I didn't know the difference (because I have never been there before) and he appeared annoyed that I didn't have a preference. He hands me two coins and I go, \"What are these for??\" He sternly goes, \"For the hydro chair.\" I go, \"Oh...okay.\" He must have been able to tell I had no idea where to go or what to do with these two coins so he walked me over to the area where the chairs and beds were. He noticed one of the beds in fact was available and asked me if I wanted to use the hydro bed after all. I said, \"yes.\" He told me to go ahead and lay down and that it would take \"a few moments\" for him to reset the computer and have it ready for me. So, I get comfortable and lay down. I waited for what I thought was \"a few moments\" and nothing was happening. I thought maybe I was supposed to put the coins in a slot somewhere?! No idea. I finally get up and go back over to him to which he came off annoyed that I was bothering him again. I told him the bed wasn't working. He reset it again and I went to go lay down again. I waited and waited and nothing happened. I finally gave up and took my things and attempted to leave. He saw me walking by and didn't understand why I was leaving. I told him the bed wasn't working yet. You can imagine how irritated he was with me now. He rudely told me that it's set on a timer and it gives me 5 minutes and that it hasn't been 5 minutes yet so go back and wait. UGH!! So I go back and lay down and wait and wait and wait. I was irritated but figured I had waited this long I might as well enjoy it. Finally I hear the machine next to me go off. It didn't dawn on me until after the fact he set up the wrong machine. I was supposed to see a small box on my screen that indicated my 5 minutes, but since he had set up the wrong bed, I never had that on mine. Since I didn't know this at the time, I'm still laying in the bed he told me to lay down in. All of a sudden another employee walks up to me and goes, \"Excuse me ma'am...you need to get off the bed because I have another person who is signed up to use it.\" ((Like I'm just laying on a non-functioning hydrobed for fun.)) At this point I had it. I go, \"Excuse me?? I've been waiting for the other guy to get this bed to work for almost 10 minutes and now you are telling me I have to move???\" I gladly got up and walked straight out of that club and will never return.\n\nSORRY Guys! But your employees need an attitude check and some customer service training. Based on my experience, your club does not stand by what you advertise either. I have since worked out at the Franklin location and will be transferring my membership there as soon as I am able. The energy in their club is more positive and their employees have been absolutely great to work with.",

The pool is dilapidated as the entire finish is crumbling, the volleyball court is full of weeds unkept and unusable. The hottub is broken and like the pool the bottom is gravel so you couldn't even sit in it anyway. The tanning bed at Trinity floor is rusted out and covered with an old dirty bath mat. I would not even use it for fear of malfunction plus when was it last service if it looks like that. After 2 weeks we wanted to cancel our membership and that's when we found out the staff was just as dysfunctional  as the buildings. I ended up having to file fraud charges with my bank and cancel my credit card to keep them from continuing to charge us.

There are also a few bootcamps to choose from that usually have an additional fee. I have participated in: spin, yoga, zumba, and one of the bootcamps and been very pleased with the equipment, facility, and instructors.  Great people work here, it is always clean and bright, there are lots of options for cardio and weights, and it never feels overly crowded.  \n\nThe only reason I am not giving 5 stars is the locker rooms, while clean, they leave something to be desired as far as showers/space/amenities.  What they do offer suits me just fine, but I have been to gyms with better locker rooms.  \n\nOverall, I have been a member of many gyms over the years and would easily recommend SRAC.",

  "text": "After years of visiting what feels like every Club Fitness in the St. Louis region, I can confidently say that the Affton gym is the best of the lot. It's well-lit, has new machines, clean locker rooms, and great group classes. Everyone that I have interacted with has been friendly and helpful, from the front dest staff to the janitorial team. \n\nThis gym is 24 hours, and the parking outside is well-lit, so you can feel safe walking in at all hours. I have not worked with any of their personal trainers, but the zumba and spinning instructors are helpful and encouraging. \n\nA few tips to get the most of your experience:\nI don't recommend going on Mondays and Tuesdays between 5-8pm because that is when it seems to be the most crowded. I've never had trouble getting an elliptical/cardio equipment, but parking and waiting for free weights during this time can be frustrating. \n\nMy only qualm is that many users do not wipe down the machines after use. This does not seem to be an issue with cardio equipment where there are sanitary stations at the ends of rows. However, this is not the fault of Club Fitness and I couldn't knock off a star. Just be sure to wipe down your machines before and after use to be safe!",

  "text": "I recently went to this gym 3 times, thanks to generous friends who had guest passes.  It's a beautiful facility.  An historic warehouse-type building has been renovated to become a gym, and the renovation used good materials and good design.  Here's what else I like about the place:  first, the pool and the hot tub are very good.  And second, the gym is located in the heart of Mt. Airy's business district, so you can go to a restaurant or bar or bookstore while you are arriving or leaving from the gym.  Third, they provide towels at this gym.  Fourth, the room used for physical therapy and classes is beautiful, with huge windows looking out across the street, but I would not use that room for my normal exercising.  This fitness center is classy and deluxe in its appearance.  Here's what I don't like:  the gym is very expensive, costing more than $700/ year per person when Planet Fitness gyms cost less than $200 (but of course there is no pool or hot tub at Planet Fitness).  The men's locker room at Fitlife is extremely small, and usually you are jammed right next to somebody else when you try to access your locker.  That's annoying.  At Planet fitness, for comparison, the locker room is spacious.  At Fitlife the room containing exercise machines and free weights is small and cramped, and the number of treadmill and elliptical machines is very small.  For comparison, Planet Fitness is spacious and spread out, with tons of natural light and tons of machines.  I am a member of Planet Fitness in Flourtown PA, so I can compare, but I have criticized Planet Fitness for having so many machines where, when you watch TV, the sound comes into one ear only through your headphones.  This is a common problem everywhere:  gyms don't repair their machines when the electronics get messed up.  Getting back to Fitlife, the reason I give it only 2 stars is because it's not a good value for the money, especially for me because I don't routinely use a swimming pool for my exercise.  The tiny locker room is a big problem.",

I got suckered into signing up for a personal trainer thinking I would get new ideas for work outs. I had ONE evaluation session then kraig cancelled on me twice and never cared to contact me to make up sessions and I got a sitter to watch my son which isn't easy. My son was born needing surgery and stayed in children's hospital for a long time. I thought getting into working out would help me cope with my son's condition. Instead La fitness took advantage of me. What makes this more frustrating is that I paid several hundred dollars maybe even $1,000 I can't remember and got NOTHING. The manager Andrew called me a liar because the personal trainer manager said I could cancel anytime. Conveniently he left when I was going through the process of canceling and trying to get my money back. These \"men\" are ignorant, rude and selfish. Kellen and Andrew knew my son was sick and continued to charge me knowing I had to be a stay at home mom. I hope people read this and turn away from this gym.

Also great about this place is the sheer number of cardio machines available. I've never had to wait while I'm there. \n\nThis location has a pool and class space. I didn't check out the locker rooms, but I'm guess they're nice as well. There's also an attached parking garage with free parking.",

It's clear to me LA Fitness is not fully invested in the overall health and wellness of their customers or else they'd never consider bringing that crap into the facility. And it's too bad because it's not a bad gym. It's crowded after work but not unbearably so. There's a mixture of types of customers and it's fun to watch and learn new moves from others. I have no idea what their prices are so I can't speak for value, but again, I'm not gonna give them my money to have junk food thrown in my face after pushing myself toward a healthier me.",

I find it easy to navigate the equipment and large enough to never wait for anything! It is extremely clean and there is plenty to offer. I haven't even begun to explore the many classes they have to offer. The best part has been the pool! It is my paradise! I have met so many people this summer and feel like I am part of a country club ! Even though I have a pool at home, this one is a social setting! Where else can you be served food and drinks without leaving your chair! After only a few days the staff already knew my name and greeted me when I came in . I recommend it to anyone with or without a family. I donot have young children but those who do, really enjoy the children's pool , slides and play area!  The adult pool is for adults over age 21 which makes it really enjoyable. It is totally relaxing!  The membership is reasonable for what you get. Most classes are included and of course the pool is included and is open until mid October ! The restaurant and bar are open to the public and they have nice Sat evening events for anyone over age 21 to attend. My husband is in his 60's and he even enjoys the DJ's and music. It has made our summer enjoyable. Get a tour and see for yourself...",

  "text": "Yes, I did this. Yes, I survived. Yes, my bro status grew by five points (from 0 to 5, that is). Located along the Canal Walk in Downtown Indy, CrossFit Infiltrate has been one of those businesses that I slowly walk past and think \"mayyyybeee one day when I'm feeling exxtraa crazy, I'll give that place a whirl.\" Well, that \"maybe\" and \"that one day\" came much sooner than I expected thanks to my pal, Jake. The free intro class is the perfect opportunity to get your toes wet in the world of cross fit (ya know, that super intimidating, tractor tire throwing world). I would say the crowd was what I expected but not overly intimidating. As embaressed as I thought I would be about working out in such a public location (row machines facing the Canal), I actually enjoyed being able to have the open air and water surrounding us. Our instructor was very informative and approachable. My push ups were ridiculous but the intro class allowed me to not feel alone in my .... weakness. The workout clearly worked muscles that I've been missing in spin and barre. I was sore for a solid 5 days. I would consider that a win.",

They give you a tour of the facility, and set you up and appointment with a personal trainer, which comes with the enrollment.\n\nI was very interested in this gym because of the pool. \n\nWhen I started working out here, I tried out the pool, and it was very slimmy on the bottom, and i didn't feel like it was very clean. I wont use it again.\n\nSomething that is nice is they have a wide variety of machines to use to choose from. \n\nThey have classes available as well, and give you a schedule when you sign up. \n\nOverall, this is a nice gym, I enjoy the sauna after working out, the locker rooms are nice and I would recommend it to a friend or family member.",

I especially love the cycle class on Tuesday with Amanda, and the Wednesday night yoga. Boot camp is also great and doesn't charge an extra fee like some other gyms. Same with TRX. \n\nNIFS has a decent amount of weights spread in multiple areas around the gym, in addition to the actual weight room, so there's always plenty of room. \n\nOnly downside is that IUPUI's pool isn't included with the membership, although I think the fee isn't too much extra if you want access to the pool as well.

  "text": "I'm back yelp friends! Short story: I've moved to Florida. Sunny, gorgeous Florida. With alligators and Zika. Not stopping me from reaching my fitness goals. You know what is stopping me?!?! Steak N' Shake, but that's for another review. Anyways, I was content at working out in the tiny apartment gym. It has some basic equipment. I gave myself DOM's (no, 50 shades fans, not that DOM. Delayed onset muscle soreness. Like when you squat so much you can't walk, those are DOMS.) I digress. I needed a squat rack. This gym wasn't cutting it. \n\nIt was my intention to check out ALL of the gyms in the area. This was first on my list. Abe is a good sales person. I have somewhat of a loyalty to ATF. It's where I began, as a mega obese girl in Oregon three years ago. Now I'm a fittish chubby girl who is like hey y'all! Coming to work out! Watch out! Anyways. I never made it to the other gyms. My nostalgia mixed with Abe's excellent salesmanship won me over, and I did what I promised I wouldn't do on the same day and signed up. \n\nI've been four times. Boot Camp on Saturday. Don't ever ever ever do Boot Camp after Friday leg day. I'm moving leg day to Thursday. I did Body Blast today and I was going to do Yoga Flow, but I changed my mind at the last minute because I was starving. :D anyways. These are the first classes I've ever done. I would like to do more. Maybe someday. Also I need more reasons to get more workout clothes. Because workout clothes are the only reasons I go to the gym 5-6 times a week. \n\nTech specs:\nSquat racks- yes\nPlenty of benches- yes\nOlympic bars-yes\nCardio stuff-I hate cardio, but yes. (Also take note that lack of cardio is why I'm still chubby. Cardio-ing it up, and no more steak N' shake. If anyone local knows of any place with healthy choices, hit me up!)\nLots of dumbells-yes\nClean-yep\nFree classes-yesssss\n\nI'll revisit this with progress when I make some.\n\n**edit: one month later,  down 13lbs and seeing some massive progress. Everyone is still amazing. I was in a vehicle accident and Abe even gave me bath salts and recruited me to come to yoga in the middle of leg day. Usually I would carry on, but I was sore. Abe, Mary, Karen, you are the best! None of the other trainers have taken time to visit with me. Kind of wonder if it's because I have RBF. Maybe, maybe not. :)\n\n**edit: 10 months later: still rocking it out and looking and feeling fantastic. Might hire a coach soon for these aesthetics. ;)\n\n***Edit: 13 months later. How come you can't out train a bad diet? I really think you should be able to. I mean? Come on! Still love the gym.",

Make sure you check your bill each month and use a credit card not debit card--they will drain your bank account and getting the money back takes loads of calls.\nOh, and the front reception folks are soooo mean! Downright mean and condescending. My 19 year old teenager asked for a bandaid and they literally started asking if she had a \"boo boo\" and making fun of her. \nThat's just one example. \nNo one ever says hi to you. No one knows my name after 3 years. No one smiles. There's one woman who is nice during the week in the morning. The afternoon and weekend crew seems well, annoyed that you are there.",

  "text": "This was my next stop on my Tour de Gyms of Tucson and it was my favorite by far. From what I saw everything was very clean and the equipment was new. The front desk staff I interacted with was very friendly. Tons of parking available in the lot. \n\nI liked that the cardio equipment was upstairs and there seemed to be a good variety. It terms of quantity, I can see how this may be a problems during peak after work times. TONS of weights--both free and machines. Everything was spread out well so you weren't catching the sweat of your neighbor. There is also a pool, 4 racquetball ball courts, basketball court and 2 different group fitness rooms. \n\nOverall, this gym seemed to attract a much younger crowd than I am used to seeing in North Tucson. I went on a Sunday morning, so it wasn't too busy. I have no doubt that this gym, like all gyms, fills up after work. So plan your workout accordingly!",

  "text": "I'm adding two stars because the staff are friendly and helpful, the child care room is amazing, and the swim teachers ROCK (my 4yo nearly has his front and back stroke down pat thanks to private lessons with Miss Angela--money well spent)...Admittedly, I realized how good we had it after visiting the Hatboro Y...which, in turn, reminded me of the one we used a few years ago back in Queens. Not much to complain about when you compare it to other YMCAs.\n\nAnd even just the lobby...a super useful space, and everybody uses it to settle their kids, wait for people, have a snack, work, study...I've actually put my kid in child care; invited a private language instructor to teach me at the table; and had dinner afterwards that I brought in and  warmed up in the microwave for me and my little dude (who's already had his fun time and shower for the evening). Oh, and they have COFFEE now. (Not recommending the pumpkin spice.)\n\nAnd the sheer number of classes, most of which are free with membership...I've posted all the schedules on the side of my pantry so we know what we can do a few hours before we decide to go. Yogalates...on my list of things to try. As well as cross train boot camp because my husband says I won't last the hour...I'll die trying. \n\nTip: Don't try to lap swim on Thursdays, especially if kids annoy you. And don't take your kids to swim on Thursdays. It's a big lesson day.",

Sure, these seem petty, but it goes toward an overall issue.\nRepairs on fitness equipment takes months some times.\nThe place just plain smells.  And it's not something that can be fixed by wiping down the equipment.

  "text": "Somehow this gym has garnered a reputation as the best in Philly and they ask for membership dues and sign-up fees that correspond with that reputation.  But beyond the prime location and the size of the place, it really is not in any way a nice or fancy gym.  The machines are old, the towels cheap, the TV systems crappy, the locker rooms are dank and crowded and the staff unhelpful and unremarkable.\n\nI have heard great things about their classes, but I didn't take any so can't speak with authority on them.  But on the basis of the gym alone; the owners clearly have demonstrated no commitment to investing in top of the line new equipment which should be the hallmark of any top rate establishment.  The treadmills appear to be at the very least 10 years old with ancient red dot LED displays, the stair masters are fine but also old and faded; there are three newer ellipticals and the rest are all old with cracked rubber handles and over-worn steps.  The basketball court is very, very nice and there appear to be regular pickup games (although the balls on the ball rack were mostly deflated, which to me is another sign of lack of attention by the staff).  \n\nYou can tell a lot about a gym by their towels.  What you get here is a thin, rough, scratchy piece of cloth that reminds me exactly of what we got to use after P.E. class in high school.  It's a small and insignificant thing in one sense (no one chooses a gym because of a towel), but to me its indicative of a larger problem in that the Sporting Club has chosen the cheapest and easiest option in a lot of areas.  They wash all their towels onsite and to upgrade to something nicer would be a relatively insignificant cost based on their size...but they chose not too as like with the old machines and the faded carpet of the \"fitness floor\" they adhere to an ethos of getting away with spending as little as possible.\n\nMy feeling is that the Sporting Club at the Bellevue has an excellent revenue stream and whoever sits on the top of that food chain has chosen to take their member's money happily and spend it on themselves rather than reinvest in the gym.  I can see how it might have been a great place at one point in time, but now its just another gym with a nice name and a good address.\n\nI spent a total of $126 dollars for a 15 day, short term membership there ($75 sign-up fee and prorated monthly fee for my 15 days).  When I signed up I specifically stated that I would like to work out until Saturday, February 4th.  I showed up on the 4th for what I expected to be my last workout. I took the elevator to the 8th floor, walked over to the desk, scanned my card and an alert popped up saying my membership was \"cancelled\".  The friendly lady at the front desk called the manager who checked into my info and said, that my short term membership had indeed expired.  Perhaps I'd counted the days wrong when I signed up (I could have and would have gladly paid for an extra day), perhaps the membership guy counted them wrong; the bottom line was that my card wasn't working and the manager had no interest in helping me out.  You'd expect any normal business to perhaps bend the rules to make a customer happy and let me in for free, or at the very least let me pay something to get in.  But no, he said unless I had a friend in the gym at that very time who could vouch for me and pay $20 for me to come in, then I wasn't welcomed.  And so I traipsed back out; somewhat incredulous but ultimately unsurprised.  The manager's effort mirrored the gym itself: just doing enough to get by but in no way trying to achieve anything above and beyond.",

Well I'm upset that I've never been able to successfully keep myself engaged in physical fitness. Yep. Despite multiple attempts, I've always fallen out of the routine just as soon as it began, and I never quite knew why. \n\nBut I do now! Workout partners! They've never stuck with me! I've had so many over the years but NONE of em would stay true to the mission, so Id just drop off the face of the earth.\n\nThat was the case UNTIL... GRIT! \n\nThis team is badass! Laura, Taryn, James, and Zach are always there and always down to kick your ass in gear with an intense workout that has your body firing on all cylinders all day long. Add to that the team dynamic and no person left behind dynamic of this group exercise program and the convenient schedule, and you've got an absolutely powerhouse combo of factors that will get any couch potato up and out, and on their way to great shape. \n\nYes. You'll hate the first few classes, but they're only 30 minutes long, so you can totally do it! Then, when you get to class number 3, you'll still be hating life for those 30 minutes but loving it for hours, days, years and decades after. \n\nApparently I needed the structure, routine, and assurance that Group Exercise offers to keep me on track, and I'm so grateful I found it.\n\nIf you're lazy like me aka incapable of staying committed to your own personal health, you owe it to yourself to check this program out. You can absolutely count on this crew to keep it fun, keep it tough, and keep you on track toward success. Heck, I'll be there and would love to sweat it out with you too! \n\nHere's to health! Many thanks to the whole GRIT team for all you do to motivate bums like me!",

  "text": "I was visiting Tampa over the weekend & this facility was the neareat outlet to my hotel next to the convention center.  It was a new & very clean facility.  I guess, technically, I'm not entitltled to use this type of club, but the desk agents didn't say anything when I scanned-in.  \n\nThe club is very large with a lot of equipment.  What stood out more than anything else from where I go at home is that I did not see a single \"Sorry for the Inconvenience\" signs on anything - not a single apparatus was awaiting repair & as I noted, this gym has much more there, and thus, a greater chance of something being broken.\n\nSo this club had everything that I use back home, so I was able to feel right at home after finding where in their set-up, each piece was located.\nThere's plenty of parking with an attached parking garage & no time limit.\nI saw a lap pool that I didn't use & the men's locker room had a sauna inside.  The shower stalls contained liquid soap, shampoo & conditioner, none of which was empty, or even low, in the stalls I used the two days I was there.  \n\nIf I lived in that downtown Tampa area, I'd up-grade my membership to make this my \"home club.\"",

  "text": "The Brewerytown/Fairmount areas are known for great food and brew options but finally there is a kick-ass place to sweat out and burn the calories each and every day. \n\nTiffany and her crew at Cycle Brewerytown are truly a step above the big-business cycling studios like Flywheel, Cyclebar, etc. Believe me, I've tried those. This baller Girard Avenue studio is composed of about 20 bikes which makes for an intimate and motivating setting. Once the door is closed, fluorescent lights go out, black lights on, music turned up, it's all about work for the next 45 minutes. Tiffany has a background as a personal trainer and brings a friendly, personable attitude but is ready to put you to work. \n\nFirst of all, the FIRST RIDE IS FREE and every ride the trainers continue to make sure you're set up comfortably on your bike and ready to work. Every ride Tiffany makes sure your form is the best possible despite how heavy and hard the workout may be. \n\nWhat's more to love about this studio? Their social media presence is awesome and drops promotional codes from time to time like 20% off rides or unlimited packages. They also rock great apparel and gear, as well. Just recently, they've added \"Spin and Conditioning\" classes that consist of 30 minutes on the bike and 30 minutes off in their other studio if you're looking to add some variety to your cycling workout. \n\nLastly, the fourth Sunday of each month, they sport a charity ride. You can ride for free with a $20 donation that goes 100% to places such as CHOP. Tiffany and her crew work hard and you will too. If you're looking for a place to go to work, push yourself, hit your goals, and be your strongest, then Cycle Brewerytown is the studio for you.",

  "text": "This is an update to a review I wrote February of 2011. Today  I was contacted via a Yelp message by the manager of this location. She mentioned that  since my review we have changes \"adding new Body Pump equipment for our classes and replacing belts & decks for our treadmills and ellipticals.\" I feel that the Improvements she mentions were much needed and probably if done the almost 2 years ago that I wrote my original review I would have given 4 stars at that time.  The reason for this and it not being 5 Is mostly that at the time I was going there the sauna needed repairs that we had mentioned to employees who were like of ya we know but for a long time they made no changes.  I left the 3 star rating I gave them at the time of the original review.",

I just wanna say that the process of walking in, being greated by the owner and talking about what I was looking for in a gym was comfortable and refreshing.  Mike, the owner, was greeting everybody by name and had a super-fun and friendly atmosphere!  As I walked the premise with Mike, I was in awe of the cleanliness and quality/newness of the equipment. Glad I made the move to get in there and thanks for you help Anytime!",

It's a great full-body workout! It is much more motivating doing it in a group with an instructor encouraging you. The time flies by. They have other classes too like TRX, HIIT, and Yoga. Overall, it's a great place, everyone is friendly, there's no pressure, and you get a great workout everytime. The workouts are always changing too, so you never get bored. I definitely recommend trying Let's Sweat!",

They have a bouldering section, a huge belay section, and a pit where you can lead climb really really high.  If I do go here I go on Saturday when they have a 2 for 1 special so it is more affordable.  The parking is kinda cool because it is right under the freeway, but it is limited.  There was one night when we had to circle a couple times waiting for a spot to open up.  I would suggest carpooling if you are going with friends.  I would highly recommend coming here!",

They have climbing routes for all abilities and the staff will help teach you how to do everything. The bouldering area can get a little crowded sometimes on weeknights so try to get there before 7pm if you want to have a climb without dealing with all the ropes and harnesses. It's a great way to get a total body workout while also the feeling you get when you put a puzzle together correctly. Their exercise classes will also kick your butt, so if you are feeling like you need a challenge, do the HIIT class on a Tuesday night and get ready to be sore for the next five days.",

  "text": "This review is simply for my initial impression of the facility and the staff as I've only been given a tour and haven't worked out at the facility yet. \n\nThe gym is small. Don't expect a Fitness Connection-sized gym. For me, this is perfect. It has two cages, a full set of free weights, nice Precor machines and Life Fitness treadmills, and a virtual workout studio with a ton of workout videos that project. Everything is very clean and organized: all weights were neatly stacked and placed, the equipment was in very good repair, and everything looked great. They have private bathrooms and showers instead of locker rooms (umm, yes. Every gym should do this). If you want tanning, it's an optional extra. They have one tanning bed. Safety and security appear to be of upmost importance at this facility, and the EMT in me thanks them for that. \n\nInsofar as service goes, it was exceptional. I was immediately and warmly greeted by Lizzy who made me feel not only welcome but appreciated. She was constantly and genuinely smiling, and I could tell she likes dealing with people. She provided me with a great tour of the facilities, going over all the ins-and-outs specific to this facility. It was compelling to sign up without being pushy; after seeing the faculty and the staff, you simply want to workout here. It's a totally different atmosphere. At the end of the tour, Lizzy gave me the pricing options and even told me about a sale they're having tomorrow. She didn't have to do this and, to be honest, I never would have known about it if she didn't tell me. This shows a level of respect for customers that is simply lacking these days. This kind of honesty is what brings me back and will keep me a customer. \n\nAs I've said, this (rather verbose) review is rather premature, but I don't see it changing in the future. If something does become amiss, I will update this review. Until then, I strongly recommend you come check out this Anytime Fitness location.",

  "text": "I love the Sporting Club. It is an incredible facility; it feels wrong to even just call it a \"gym.\" I've been enjoying it for a little over a month now, I was able to join because of a LivingSocial deal which reduced the normal monthly fee of $102 to $60 (and no initiation charge and a massage or personal training session, to boot!). This now stands as the best LivingSocial deal ever in the history of the universe and it shall never be surpassed. Fin. \n\nI find most gyms utilitarian. Some are nicer than others, some have more equipment or shorter wait times for machines or cleaner facilities, but generally the vibe is people are there to work out and you go in and get it done and go home. The atmosphere here is totally different. The whole place just seems designed to make you feel taken care of. On the first floor, there is a small cafe with very friendly staff, I like to stop there for a quick snack and some coffee after an early-morning workout. There are some armchairs in front of a flat-screen TV that's usually tuned to CNN, some longer tables where you could eat lunch, and a few smaller tables by the windows overlooking Broad Street that have a great view. I've been to other gyms that have juice bars/cafes, but this one just has a very pleasant, friendly vibe to it. \n\nThe locker rooms are great. They're never crowded, the lockers are big enough to fit whatever you've brought with you. They have absolutely every amenity you could want - for the showers, there are shower caps, razors, body wash, shampoo/conditioner, and shaving cream. The towels are fluffy and always plentiful. There are individual vanities stocked with deodorant, hairspray, body lotion, hairdryers (with diffusers!) and curling irons. Whatever you need, they have it here. I don't think I've showered at home since becoming a member. \n\nSince it's been approximately 1 million degrees throughout my membership, I've been using the pool rather than the other fitness facilities. It is absolutely lovely. It is occasionally crowded enough that I've had to share a lane, but everyone is very friendly about it. Only once have I ever had to actually wait for a lane, and that was literally for five minutes. After my swims, I like to indulge in a soak in the giant hot tub, which is the size of my living room at home. I am not kidding. There is also a sauna. The hot tubs and saunas are single-sex, while the pool is co-ed. I'm a fan of the setup. \n\nAs others have mentioned, if the Sporting Club has an achilles heel, it is the price. I believe the normal initiation fee is $450, on top of the $102 monthly membership fee. They were recently running a promotion for a $99 initiation fee, but you're still looking at a considerable amount of outlay for a gym membership. If you can find a way to fit it into your budget, it would absolutely be worth it. After my promotion ends, I'll be wistfully looking forward to the day my life allows me to return!",

But that's never the case in Jeni's classes.  She moves at such a good pace- keeps your heart rate and mind going the entire class!  And her energy and confidence is super motivating...she never lets you give up!  The classes have a very wide demographic as well- young adults to seniors- all shapes and sizes. \n\nThe only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because this is currently the only class I can vouch for at the studio. I do know that they are constantly adding classes and trying out new group exercise ideas on a very regular basis- so boredom can never set in.\n\nYou can't beat their drop in class rates- $7 for regular classes, and I think $10 for specialty classes.  This is awesome for people like me who have irregular schedules and don't want to commit to a $60/month gym membership when some months I can't get to any classes.   I pay only for the time I work out! Additionally, they have classes at all different times throughout the day and night (not just 6am and 6pm, which are awful times for me when I work 3pm-midnight).  \n\nThe flexibility of the classes and energy of the studio makes Flava Fitness a great choice for keeping your workout regiment fun and fresh :)",

That was a reasonable price considering how frequently I attended. Now that I do not work locally, I get the packages and they break down to $15-20 per class.

  "text": "How have I not reviewed OT in Reno yet?!  This place is amazing.  It is an incredible workout via organized classes with awesome music.  You stay with the same \"number\" throughout the workout, so it is smooth and you are never fighting anyone for equipment.  You wear a heartrate monitor and the goal is to get a certain number of minutes in the orange zone, which is challenging and definitely possible.  The workout room is a \"phone free\" zone and I find it SO nice to unplug for an hour out of my day.  The trainers and the ladies at the front desk are THE BEST.  Definitely check it out!!",

Each class is about 45 min. \n\nI like that they play upbeat EDM music- it was easier for me to get through the class. Our instructor was Tiffany and she was super nice and patient with helping us adjust our bikes and teaching the class. I think this is a great place for beginners! \n\nThey have showers but only like 2-3 so I recommend just going home to shower. The studio is located on the 2nd floor. If I was still living in the city I'd be interested in coming back.",

  "text": "Love this location. This is the old Ballys location. This location is really big. I haven't been to any other location so I am not sure it they are all this big. On the lower level they have plenty of machines. Nothing worse than going to workout and you have to wait for a machine. I really like have everything is organized. Cardio machines one area, weight machines another area, free weights in another area. On the top level they have the running track, crossfit areas, theres another area with a few machines. Then they have classes as well which are held upstairs. If you have the highest package the classes are included which is awesome. I haven't tried any of the classes, but there are a few that are very intriguing to me. Then they have an aqua massager which I have used aftet everyone of my workout. It is a perfect way to end your session. They also have a stand up tanning booth, that's my next adventure. And finally they have a sauna in the restrooms. Oh speaking of the restrooms, the womens (cause I haven't been in the mens LOL) it great. They have a sitting area with tv's, it's open, plenty of lockers and nice showers. The only thing I wish they had was for the shower area big enough to have a changing area with the showers. That way you can have all your stuff right there ans dont have to go to three different areas to get ready.",

Mostly everything is contained in one room including all weights and crunch stuff, but they have a space for the Aqua Jets and massage chairs (which I pay an extra $10 to use because it's an AMAZING deal for those!).

  "text": "I've met a lot of good, skilled guys who went or go to Paragon.  There's no doubt they have some of the best instruction in a 40 mile radius.  That being said, when I went to test out a class, the atmosphere left something to be desired.  \n\nFirst some fat guy was making backwards comments because I don't buy their wrist wraps and wrap my hands to punch bags.  He was saying something to the effect of, \"Yeah he doesn't need wraps because he can't punch hard.\"  Or some nonsense which i found a bit absurd from someone who has never even met me before.  I find the whole wrist wrap thing a gimmick for schools to make more money.  You need impact on your wrists when you're practicing to build strength and bone density.  Sparring is a different story, but I don't need some fat dude insulting me to other students just to make a buck or make himself look better because he was chumped into paying to keep his wrists dainty.  \n\nSecond, I was waiting on the couch with the owner's dog, and when I made a friendly joke about the dog owning the place, the owner snapped at me with, \"Yeah you're in his F*CKING SEAT.\"  Wow, dude is sensitive about his dog or his skanky torn-up couch.  In any case, I wasn't convinced this was the school for me.  Plus I don't think yelling \"F*CK\" in the lobby where kids can hear is appropriate either.\n\nThird, the \"gym\" section was a dirty cluttered mess with equipment in chaos in disarray.  I come from traditional martial arts background so in my Kung Fu and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu classes, and even in some of the kickboxing classes I've taken, the students don't leave the place a mess as it would be considered disrespectful to the school. \n\nSo yeah, I'm cool with a bit of hazing when you are actually part of the school and you know the people.  But when you're a potential customer, you should be treated with respect.  No doubt if you want elite instruction you can suffer through the douchebags and learn a lot here, but as the stars point out, I've experienced better.  Paragon has no shortage of customers so it's not surprising they can afford to be less than civil with new clientele. \n\nLastly, they didn't offer any packaged deal to take both kickboxing and BJJ.  You just have to pay full price for each.  So if you got over $300 a month to blow, go for it, but that's out of my range.\n\nOh, I almost forgot, I had funky colored hair at the time and I remember the fat Mexican guy I mentioned previously whispering comments about that to other students too.   So if insecure instructors try to act like high school bullies, I can't imagine I'd want to send my children here. \n\nI will say the guy who actually did instruct me in the kickboxing class was very nice, very knowledgeable, and from what I can tell, a true martial artist.  But the owner needs to do some house cleaning in more ways than one.",

  "text": "I've been a member twice:  04/2004-2010, then re-joined a month ago after considering and/or being a member of YMCA, Chuze and Undisputed. Nationwide locations, ADA compliance and cost were ultimately the most important reasons I re-joined LAF. \n\nThis particular club has, so far, the best equipment for my purposes out of the 3 LAFs I've been to around Tucson since rejoining, although the other clubs are fine also, just without the Pool or whatever. \n\nJavier signed me up with no bs, making a recommendation that was right for me, a returning member, even after such a long absence. LAF, I gotta say, was REALLY persistent via emails. Javier was professional, a really good listener, so naturally, I left the meeting feeling I'd made the right decision. \n\nThe facility is extremely clean, considering it IS a WORKOUT FACILITY. \n\nCardio equipment is plentiful and in working order, even at peak times. I like it that there are machines available for disabled folks on the bottom level. There are lots more cardio machines on the second level. I use the tread for 20 minutes 4-5x/week. \n\nWeight machines are on the ground level and plentiful, but busy at peak times. I work lower body for 20 minutes 3x/week. Upper body 2x/week. \n\nFree weights:  Don't know, but there are lots of them. \n\nClasses:  Don't know. I can barely feel my feet, so I'm intimidated. \n\nDayCare:  Don't know. Didn't see any small children, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's available. \n\nBasketball Court and Racquetball:  Don't know, but they look fantastic. Wish I could still play well. \n\nThe Indoor Pool looks sparkling, although I haven't used it, but other folks do. It's plainly visible from the first floor weight machines area. \n\nMen's Locker Rooms and Sauna:  extremely clean, but kinda close quarters at peak time. Sauna always at 165-180. Think Phoenix in June. \n\nParking is free and plentiful, although can be a bit of a walk at peak times. \n\nNon-peak times:  8:30 am-3:00 pm. After 6:00 pm. Hours are shorter, but workable, on weekends and holidays. \n\n$35/month. No contract. Good deal for me and my health. Something to make my Doctor happy",

Staff seems to try to enforce rules only with certain people, and only for a short period of time. (Like walking past three people with gym bags in the middle of the gym floor up to me, to tell me the small bag I have tucked under the bench I'm on can not be on the floor, despite the fact that I've had one with me every gym session since they opened.) But by far the biggest issue I have is that the gym is already far too busy, yet they insist on constantly having flea markets in the gym during peak hours. Had there been a few tables offering meal prep or fitness related stuff, I'd have no choice but to accept it, but they have tables selling candles, baked goods, jewelry, and at least once clothing for toddlers. This brings in far too many people, crowding the gym even more. I'm sure this isn't acceptable to corporate, yet I've not received any response from the emails I've sent on their site. Just keep in mind that this is what you should expect when joining this gym. Guess you can't have your expectations too high when it comes to a $10 a month membership.",

  "text": "This is hands-down the worst gym I've ever been to. It falls short on equipment, cleanliness, communication, and pricing. I used to belong to a Planet Fitness because I like clean, cheap, no-nonsense gyms that offer the basics. After moving to Old City, I was in search of something similar, so I bought a Groupon for 15 visits (includes regular gym visits or group fitness classes) for roughly $45. Oh man, I felt bad wasting the money, but I could only force myself to come here about 9 times over the course of 3 months. The gym itself is in an old row-house, and has a distinctly dirty feel to it. Much of the cardio equipment is broken, with no signs of ever getting fixed, meaning I'd often find myself waiting in line for a dated, wonky treadmill for upwards of 30 minutes. As far as free weights, there was only one set of 8 pound weights in the entire place. On three separate occasions, I showed up for scheduled group fitness classes, and upon arrival, was told they'd been cancelled. Are you serious? Send out an email, or ask members who care about group fitness to opt into text alerts. Continuously cancelling classes without telling your members is just abysmal customer service. And finally, the icing on the cake, is that Sweat makes its employees hound Groupon customers about joining the gym full-time. I got several calls and voicemail every week, offering me a \"special limited-time deal\" to convert my Groupon membership to a full-time membership. After answering two calls and declining the offer twice, I still kept getting the calls. Look, I know no one wants to join your gym and this might seem like a way to drum up business, but it isn't. It's awful and annoying, and just another reason I'd never set foot in a Sweat Fitness again. I did get an email last week that this location is now under new management that hopes to address some of the concerns I listed above, and I wish them the best of the luck, but they have a long way to go before this becomes anything close to a decent gym.",

It just seems really not up to date compared to the gyms in Kenner, River Ridge and New Orleans East. The machines are older, the water system isn't automated, and the smell is so pungent. It's always the most packed and the parking lot is tiny. Often times, you have to park across the street and dodge traffic trying to make it back to the gym.",

  "text": "Orange Theory is crazy! I got my ass kicked in that hour doing this workout, but it was awesome. The place is super clean, and the instructors and other staff are really nice. \n\nDuring this workout, the class is split into two halves. One half is doing cardio while the other is doing strength training. While the actual workout itself changes, the premise is the same. \n\nWhen I went, I did 26 minutes on the treadmill. It was all intervals, and what I was doing changed according to the instructor's directions. Walkers increase/decrease the incline while runners increase/decrease the speed. The toning was 26 minutes as well and has a set of three or four workouts that people repeat until time is up. \n\nAll the while, I had a heart monitor strapped to my chest, and my classmates' and my progress was posted on the TV. This way, I knew my heart rate at all times and strived to get it into certain zones. There were time goals for which zones I wanted to be in and for how long. \n\nMy only complaint is not all the instructors are as good as the others. And not all the desk clerks are as efficient as the others. \n\nIt was super hard and super fun, but I will definitely be back.",

  "text": "What's not to like??!! I've been a member since about 2006. I've lived in various places and have never found a place even close to TRFC with such a wide offering of water or other kinds of classes with such great instructors, esp at the price. Deborah S. gives a good run down of the amenities. I'm a water aerobics fanatic and they have an incredible offering of not only water classes but many other fitness classes and they keep up on latest trends. Instructors are terrific! Very dedicated and well trained! Staff is great, mostly very friendly. (Whenever my mom visits from out of town they're very nice to her.) I also like the body conditioning and postural fitness classes and just recently tried some of the machines, which were great. The two hotbus (one outside one in) are both wonderful as is the steam room. The women's locker room isn't luxurious but certainly nice enough and always clean. They provide a cheap towel service but I bring my own. \n\nI do like that it has country club amenities but at middle class prices and attitude. I wouldn't feel comfortable at a country club in the foothills and wouldn't trade my TRFC for a place like that. Facilities at TRFC are good enough, great, even. The facilities workers are fabulous, keeping the pools and hot tubs always clean and sparkling, all the workout rooms are great, and the grounds are beautifully groomed. Remodeling has been underway in different parts for some time. Right now the upstairs bar/restaurant which, according to the pictures, looks like it's going to be really nice. There's a restaurant downstairs, too. TRFC has one of the best breakfast and dinner menues in town. (Coffee could be improved and no espresso coffees is a slight negative.) Otherwise, food is great and prices are very reasonable. Service is uneven but worth the wait if you have the time. The only thing that approaches a downside for me is that singles (like myself) pay a higher price on a per person basis than, say, families or couples. I don't think that's fair, but I think it's still a great deal! And they also give a slight discount if you pay a year ahead. Parking can be a bear around 10am, but I'm lucky to live within walking distance and don't have to deal with that unless I'm short on time or it's just too darn cold out to walk! Oh, and the place has a fabulous view of the Catalinas which I enjoy immensely as I work out in the pool in a water aerobics class, sometimes with hawks flying overhead :-))",

The young lady at the front desk do not (or referred me to another staff) give me tour of the facility. She pointed from the front area of the gym where everything is. Thanks a lot. Really I was annoyed but I wanted to do my workout. The gym is so small. The treadmills are stacked so close that runners would have to run consecutively to not invade ones privacy. The area where the fitness class are held is small and have no privacy. No showers. The elliptical I used had dust so there's no telling when was the last cleaning. I did not enjoy my visit. Also the owner harassed me via text message at night. If he truly cared about good customer service he would have dealt with such matters in appropriate manner and in a more professional  way.",

Not good. \n\nThe locker room floor situation has not improved. In fact, one could write their name in the caked \ngrime if they desired.

You come in, work out and get out.  People who work out at this gym are serious about getting in shape and it shows.  \n\nWhen you enter, you are greeted by a the same staff members every time.  They have had little turnover since I started here a couple years ago.  They also have a great selection of shakes, both pre exercise or a recovery.  I love the whole menu.  \n\nI've recently been taking the yoga classes and they are very well taught.  The instructor Ashley talks you through the posses and lends a little extra attention beginners and includes variations for the more advanced participants.  \n\nThere are a lot of classes to choose from including boot camps and cross fit in addition to the typical spinning and zumba.  \n\nThis gym also has a good deal of equipment that other gyms don't. \nBoxes to jump on, ropes, medicine balls, stretching straps, a massive ab tower, rubber weights for dead lifts, and so on.  \n\nBefore I forget, I have to include the fact that people here actually clean their equipment after they use it.  A rare thing in today's gyms.  \n\nIn the end the only complaint that I have is that turning back onto Hampton can be a challenge in rush hour.  \n\nGet in here and get fit.",

  "text": "I'm going to preface this review by saying I hate to exercise and I'm cheap. I don't like running. I don't like cycling, or swimming. But, I've always felt guilty about not wanting to stay fit so I've always belonged to a gym. And I've belonged to many over the years (Gold's Gym in Naples, FL, Bally's Gym in Boston, Healthworks for Women in Brookline, Philadelphia Sports Club, Newtown Athletic Club). \n\nThe problem with my joining a gym is that while most have offered a lot of classes (Kickboxing for Mommies! Zumba for Couch Potatoes!), and amenities (eucalyptus steam room anyone?), I rarely used any of them. I went in, did my workout and left. Didn't really even need a locker room because I could just put my jacket by a window. \n\nAnd I never went to the gym. Maybe I'd go for spurts, like three times a week for a month, then I'd peter out and go once a month, then once a quarter, then once a year. \n\nWhen I moved to Wynnewood a little over two years ago, I up and joined Philadelphia Sports Club because it was a stone's throw from my driveway (I knew if a gym was too far, or out of my regular driving routine of dropping off and picking up the kids, I'd certainly never go). I went regularly at first, then the visits petered out until I realized it was October 2012 and I hadn't set foot in the gym for 8 months. That's right. I don't exaggerate when I say I rarely go to the gym. At $60 a month, I had wasted $480. That was enough to get me to quit my membership. I was still not exercising, but at least I wasn't wasting money anymore doing nothing.\n\nSo when a Planet Fitness postcard arrived in the mail in early January, with the offer of a $10 initiation fee and $10 or $20 per month membership, I figured it was time to go back to the gym because it was relatively cheap. I knew all about their \"no judgement zone\" philosophy, lunk alarm and no frills approach toward getting and staying fit. I opted for the $20 monthly membership, which was 1/3 of what I was paying at PSC, but which most importantly lets me use the massage chairs for free (and bring a guest every visit in addition to a few other perks).\n\nPlanet Fitness is exactly what I was looking for in a gym but didn't realize it. Tons of equipment, friendly staff, clean, convenient to my house, and inexpensive. I love that I'm not paying for features I don't use, and I love the Tootsie rolls that they keep at the counter that I eat while sitting in the massage chair after my workout.\n\nWhat would make PF perfect? If their \"no judgement zone\" mantra--which is plastered all over the gym--were actually spelled correctly.",

I'm not self motivated AT ALL, so the fact that I show up speaks to the dedication and talent of their instructors. \n\nThey have plenty enough cardio equipment, and lots of machines.

My main reason for joining was a variety of classes and I have been a bit disappointed there, dance classes I've tried were Dance Jam and Hip Hip and both were a joke. Both were a watered down version of Zumba, there is absolutely NO hip hop in hip hop class and instructors were kind of bad... not staying true to count, and putting on a performance more than teaching a class. I'm an ex dance instructor myself. Also, there's a lot more paid classes than I anticipated. \n\nAs far as machines they're all awesome and a lot I've never seen before, gym is never crowded even though the parking lot is huge. The cafe is of course super expensive. Steam and sauna rooms are always clean as well as the spa. Pools look great, but way to many lifeguards watching you.. it's almost uncomfortable. I put my feet (just feet) in the pool the other day and was immediately told by a lifeguard that I'm not allowed to do that... Apparently it was an area close to the slides even though they were not working and no one was using them. Hard to relax with like 5 of them staring at you at all times. \n\nBut overall, I do like it... feels good going there and being there. This gym is definitely in a league of its own.",

  "text": "After climbing here for about 6 months, I'm still really satisfied with the gym. And in LOVE with climbing. As I said before, it's not the largest or most state-of-the-art in the area, but for pure climbing it's great. \n\nThe staff changes up the routes pretty frequently, so it keeps things fresh. Every couple of weeks or so there are new routes to try, ranging up to 5.12+. It's frustrating when a route you're working on gets taken down, but equally exciting when a new one is put up. The bouldering walls get changed up pretty frequently too, though they could use some labeling to get around \"white is really easy\"... \"oh try neon green, it's like impossible\". Bob, the friendly and accommodating owner, is working on putting up V ratings but hasn't gotten too far yet. \n\nI also love the community aspect of climbing. It's great seeing some of the same faces from week to week and always meeting new people. Climbers and the staff are almost always willing to help you out wherever they can. \n\nInteresting fact: Victory brewing company is right next door and in the summer the beer brewing scent wafts in. Have you ever smelled beer being brewed? It alternates between appetizing and nauseating (for me at least) and smells like a combination of bread baking and something funky yet indescribable. You really have to experience it for yourself. \n\nAlso of note, the floor is made up of little pieces of tire-like rubber. This provides a nice, soft landing. However, it inevitably follows you home and shows up in your car, your bed, your great aunt's sock drawer... not to mention all the black dirt you breathe in that comes out in your boogers the next day. Sorry to be gross, but I got the black nose Pa... *cough cough sniffle*. \n\nAnywho, the $240 for the six month pass was well worth it. When it expires I'm sure I'll renew it. Judging from what I've heard about other rock gyms in the area in terms of size, variety, atmosphere, location, and price, I'm fairly confident that Vertical Extremes is the place for me. Not that other places aren't great too I'm sure, but all things considered I'm perfectly happy here.",

  "text": "I'd all but given up on gym memberships after an awful experience trying to get out of a contract at a not-so-local place in town. Plus running is free...\n\nBut after a serious workout rut, I decided to give Let's Sweat a try. Man am I glad I did.\n\nBecause here's the thing, working out is way more fun in a group. When you're all sweating together, it's easier to get through when you want to quit. \n\nPlus it's nice to have someone telling you what to do in this instance.\n\nAnd those people telling you what to do, the instructors at Let's Sweat, are great. Each is different, which means there's something for everyone. The classes are all challenging, but each instructor puts their own 'spin' on things -- from Julie's themed playlists to Nicole's early-morning jokes, Lauren's motivational intros to Brittany singing along to the tracks.\n\nAnd Let's Sweat feels like a real community. The staff knows just about every one by name, and everyone is so welcoming. There are fun challenges and tons of ways to keep you motivated.\n\nIf you want a place to pay a monthly fee without results, Let's Sweat is not for you. But if you want an encouraging and challenging place to see really change and get a killer workout, it definitely is!",

You spend 55 minutes working muscles that you've only heard of, and believe me, it's a game changer. \nEver had your abs shake so hard you feel you're about to collapse on yourself? Well you're about to. But don't think this is a bad thing. You look around and see everyone on Sweatlana (what the Solidcore team calls the torture machines that whip your abs into shaky, sweaty submission) and you feel a sense of community that comes from knowing exactly how much pain every single person in that room is in. \nPerhaps the biggest incentive to come to one of these classes is how you feel about your body afterwards. Almost everyone suffers from thinking they're not 'fit enough' (whatever that means), but after one of these classes, you want to pat yourself in the back for making it through something that's insanely difficult, and feel that you're basically doing everything you can to honor the body that you have. \nTry it. You will not regret it.",

The staff is friendly and not overbearing or pushy. There are promotional deals at any given time of the year so be sure to ask before you join. When I first day with a gym rep to talk about pricing he advised me of the best possible deal and made me aware of the specials going on. With ample availability in both of the parking garages in Hyde Park Village, you will not get frustrated attempting to park. There are very spacious and clean restrooms with lockers as well with a scale and sauna (and hairdryer for the ladies).\n\nThe gym offers group fitness schedule with new schedules printed every week. I don't usually or take of the group fitness classes but I have been to a spin class and it was awesome. The instructor name was Patty and it was a great workout. I imagine that the other group fitness classes are great as well, as they are taught by qualified instructors. \n\nI usually come to the gym very early in the morning or later at night around 8pm to avoid the after work rush that the gym gets crowded with. Many of the cardio machines have TV monitors so bring your headphones or you can make use of closed captioning. There are also machines which have iPod/iPhone hookups/chargers. I feel that this gym has something for everyone :)",

I love the lightning in the gym at night, it's like a club or something, super dark mixed with blue light and pink light and red light and it feels very private, i feel like girls can go there at night with no makeup lol.  \nI don't use the pool or the steam room in this location so i can't comment on that. But the locker room is huge and clean.  Cardio machines were a bit sticky a few time i visited, so remember to wipe down before and after you use it. \nOh also no one is ever at the frontdesk after midnight. \nThis location opens 24/7 unlike the one in the South.",

  "text": "Not sure why I didn't join this gym when I first moved to New Orleans. By paying a bit more than a usual gym membership, I get access to excellent classes (with some diverse options, like Olympic lifting, \"strongman\", gymnastics, etc.) in addition to getting regular access to the gym. While it doesn't have all the machines a typical gym would have, those are less useful anyways. This is also more than compensated by the fact that the gym is huge and has lots of space for lifting. If you do any weightlifting, especially with barbells, stop going to a regular gym and fighting for scarce space. The coaches are very good and the gym-goers are a good and diverse bunch in terms of experience. This is very much worth the investment. You'll get a much better and more holistic workout, you don't have to spend time planning workouts, and you'll feel like a part of the community. Only downside is (at least during this pandemic), the weekend hours suck. But if you're diligent about hitting the gym on all other days then Sunday can be an off day without it impacting anything.",

If your goal is to build muscle, maintain, or lose fat, you can definitely get the job done here for $19.99/month. If you want to mindlessly work out and be instructed on what to do, then take a group class. This Retro offers a variety of classes. So you want a pool, basketball courts, sauna, a steam room, and an expensive gym membership? Then you should take your boujee self on over to LifeTime Fitness. \n\n\nReason for the 3 stars... well I've run into situations where the leg extension machine was down or out of commission for a week to MONTHS (happened last year). Instead of the typical temporary fix of having a service tech repair the piece of equipment this past time, the machine was finally replaced in its entirety. IMO there should be 2 leg extension machines. And the instructor running the kickboxing class has to deal with some run down freestanding heavy bags that leaks water from the base for the duration of the class. He shouldn't have to be frequently wiping the puddles on the floor during class to ensure none of his class participants slip and fall. Those bags should be replaced. Or fill the base with sand perhaps?",

I am a long distance runner/major exercise junkie so I thought that the workout would be a breeze but after my first class I realized that I could not have been more wrong. I literally hobble out of the studio every time that I take a class. This workout taps into muscle groups that I didn't know existed. The first class I took was a bit intimidating because the workout is so unique and unlike anything that I had done before but I am so glad that I stuck with it! I have seen a huge improvement in my running since I started at solidcore, especially on hills. It is a total game changer.\n\nThe studio itself is super cute and has free water and towels. All of the instructors are fun and knowledgeable, especially when it comes to modifications. While it is a group fitness class, it has a very personal feel. The instructors give great feedback, talk you through the entire workout, and encourage you to push outside of your comfort zone. \n\nI highly recommend giving it a try!",

  "text": "I think I was too harsh on City Fitness. I have a one month pass I got in the mail to try it out, and it's growing on me. the biggest downside to me is that it doesn't have the equipment I've come to know and love at the Penn Pottruck gym. if you're really into crossfit style workouts, this isn't really the place for you (unless you join Thrive and work out in their area which looks to have amazing equipment!). there are no bumper plates, and i really wish they would leave an extra barbell permanently in the area next to the leg press machine for deadlifting (there is a trap bar.. but meh). it's a small space, so they can only fit so much in. there's only one set of 12.5 lb dumbbells downstairs for example- which is a popular size with women, so if other women are lifting i usually have to wait. i also noticed today when i was leaving spin class that they do group personal training downstairs in the astroturf area and take it over which is a bit of a bummer because i love using that equipment (trx ropes/kettlebells). i'm not sure how often that happens though.\n\non the plus side, it's open almost all the time (5 am to 1 am) - this is HUGE for me. i am a mom and being open that early means i can work out and get home in time to have breakfast with my kiddo before work. same goes for being able to book a spot in a class online ahead of time. it's incredibly convenient. the amount of classes offered is also excellent and i like that there are classes offered on the weekends. i've only gone to spinning so far but every time the instructors have been great. the location is fantastic too if you live or work in G-Ho.",

Front staff is always pleasant and even though I'm only here to take the Zumba class, they tell me I have full access to the fitness center, including the showers, etc. They seem to have a nice selection of cardio and weight equipment and the place never seems very busy when I've been there. Plenty of lockers in the mens room and showers are private in that there is a shower curtain that can be used. Soap, shampoo and conditioner are provided, or you can bring your own. Hair dryers are also available along with mens spray deodorant  in case you forget your own I guess. There is also a sauna room in there as well. Overall, seems like a nice local gym, but again, I don't really live near here and only come for the Zumba classes.",

  "text": "No issues with the workout here at all. I've done workouts on the megaformer plenty of times and I thought it would be similar. It is, but this 10x harder, in a good way. My only issue is with some of the coaches. I have a bad back so sometimes I have to make concessions. I guess I have to make sure to tell the coaches beforehand if I need to do something different because of my back. Some coaches are ok with it, and some give me dirty looks. Or sometimes you are completely ignored if you dare to use the white resistance band instead of the grey with their \"10 class\" rule. Today one of the coaches refused to add weight to the upper body section of the class when she moved everyone else's. Really? So I had to stop and add them myself, which annoyed me since I lost workout time during the VERY QUICK transitions. Speaking of those, I sometimes can't transition that fast, again because of my back, and the reps are halfway over by the time I get settled. All in all, a great workout, but I'm not sure if it just a matter of sticking to only going to classes that have certain coaches or accepting that Solidcore might just be too advanced for me.",

I like that.  No kids running in and out of the place like at Lifetime Fitness.  While there was a hard sales pitch at the Mt Laurel location, there was not in Cherry Hill.  I will be joining at this location. \nCons: the locker rooms are never cleaned! Seriously, the trash wasn't emptied all weekend.  The same wet paper towels were on the floor for two days.  It's a little gross. The steam room and sauna should be wiped down at least every night. However, because I like the clientele, and  quiet locker room, I bring my own disinfectant wipes into the sauna and steam room to make up for the lack of cleanliness.\nAlso... there are NO water fountains anywhere! So bring lots of water or you'll have to buy it there.\nFor the price, it's a decent gym.  If I had to pay any more than $40/mo, I'd be joining virtua, not Future Fitness.",

  "text": "I have been going to this gym for a few months now and I have to say the facility itself is nice and appears to be well maintained, although I can only speak to the pool facility on an everyday basis because due to an injury, that is the only area that I am able to enjoy on a daily basis. The locker rooms are pretty clean and the front desk staff is friendly. The executive assistant Ashley is also very helpful and responsive. \n\nSo why only the three stars? \n\nI had referred a co-worker to this gym and she had forgotten to inform them of the referral within 30 days of her signing up so they refused to honor the free month that was owed to me (even though the referred person has to stay a member for 90 days). I am very disappointed that they would not honor their referral program on such a technicality.\n\nUpdated Review: \n\nWhile the facilities are nice and the staff friendly, the management is pretty greedy. I was looking forward to taking the boxing classes offered by Clif but I come to find out the 10 week program is $250 for Members?! Ummm WHAT?! (Non-members are $299). Not to mention I received the email notification 3 days AFTER the program had already started. Also, tanning is additional $. For the price of a monthly membership, the tanning should be free. Lastly, it's lovely that they offer soap, shampoo and lotion for the patrons but it's so low quality that they are pretty much unusable so what is the point? The clientele vary and you will find a lot of self-important showy people walking around but luckily the size allows you not to have to have direct interaction with most of them. Overall this is one of the best gyms in the area but I wouldn't call this a top notch sporting club compared to ones in other cities. Did I mention quite a few of their group classes are at strange times such as 7:00am vs. 7:30am and they while they offer quite a few during the day (not many of us have that flexibility), they have no classes after 7:30pm. It is not fun for us night owls who prefer avoiding crowded classes in the am.",

Some of the boards of the treadmills are sounding like they're ready to give.\n\n2) When you can get a chair massage with a full membership and then suddenly you can't because you need to increase your monthly membership by 50%, that is a bait-and-switch. I get having new membership tiers (who doesnt want to make more money - right?) but it should be for totally new services.\n\nSo I have had to downgrade my rating but as you will note it is still quite high as gyms go.\n\nI would suggest that they *encourage* members to report machine issues like shaky boards rather than act like youre being a \"fly in the ointment\" (or business model). Perhaps a repair suggestion box. This would be especially useful for those of us who have 24-hour memberships.",

  "text": "If I could give this a zero star I would. In March 2020 I decided to joint Crunch Fitness on Bloomingdale. Of everyone knows COVID happened shortly after. During the state wide shutdown I attempted to find a number to call crunch in order to cancel my membership because my wife is high risk. Of course there are no general contact number because the gym is franchised.  I tried contacting the gym during the closer and was unsuccessful. So, on Monday May 18, 2020 Gym's opened as well did crunch fitness. I called them at 0800 to cancel my account. They said in order to cancel I would have to go in person or send a certified letter.  So after work at 3pm I stopped by. I learned that as of that day everyone in crunch was charged $27 which was ok if I was going to use the gym. I talked to the AM and explained that I won't be using the gym at all because of my wife's status and asked if I could be refunded my money because of COVID. Their response was \"no, we are not giving any refunds. If we gave you a refund we would have to give everyone a refund.\"  So I spoke to the GM. At this point I just wanted my account canceled. She wouldn't cancel my account because when you initially sign up there is a 90 day mandatory period. Fine my $27 takes me to my 90th day but I still wouldn't be using the gym. The GM said oh btw in ten days you're going to be charged approximately $45 for your annual fee.  Wait what? I explained that it's not that I don't want to use the gym it's that I can't again due to my wife's condition. GM then mentioned she may need to contact her manager and get a doctors not about my wife's condition. I've called everyday since to get an update from the GM and have been unsuccessful because the GM is always busy but won't return my calls even though I leave my information. Finally someone talked to me and relayed messages between the GM and I on the phone because the GM Kirstey won't take the call. I was told \" Kirstey has already passed your information to her manager and he will get back with you. We no longer have access to your account and can't change the active status.\"  There was no guarantee that the annual charge wouldn't be charge to my account nor that I would get my $27 back and my account was still active. I will never join a gym again nor will I ever recommend crunch to anyone.  \n\nJuly 11,2020\nStill waiting for their supervisor or someone above the general manager to call me.  I've made multiple attempts to contact Kirstey but she's still not responding to me. Don't know what else to do. Now I can't cancel even if I wanted to because they kept charging my account the monthly fees and you can't cancel unless your account is up to date on payments.",

The majority of machines are in service and run smoothly.\n\nSecond, they have a nice supply of supplements that are well priced and below the competition. Their vending machine is well stocked and is no longer rejecting dollar bills for the smallest wrinkle(been there). Definitely worth a visit!",

I met with Nicole multiple times per month at Let's Sweat for 8 months leading up to my wedding. I've struggled to get into a consistent exercise routine since high school, and Nicole coached me to get to the healthy place I am today. She focuses on overall health and wellness, including food and exercise, that is sustainable instead of a crash course that doesn't allow you to build healthy habits. I now actually look forward to working out and enjoy eating food that's good for my body. Thank you, Nicole and Let's Sweat for getting me here!",

  "text": "The gym is okay - I thoroughly enjoyed my time there visiting my family for the holidays.  My wife and I live out of state. \n\nThis 2-star rating is solely for the lack of communication and misleading information I was given when I signed up and checked in for my trial period.  I signed up online for a trial period with whole intentions of canceling before the trial was done.  I know this is not ethically sound, but I was 100% honest with the gym when I signed up and told them what my intentions were; I again mentioned this upon checking in for the first time.  I was told at check-in by one of the employees working the front desk that they would set up my trial and make a note in the system to automatically cancel after the period was done since we talked about it beforehand.  I was actually very surprised/impressed that they would do this; so I repeated exactly what they just told me back to them as 100% confirmation, and they absolutely confirmed that there was NOTHING needed from my end to cancel the membership before leaving the gym for the last time during my trial.  \n\nOne month later - billed $40 monthly membership, phone call that went absolutely nowhere, and now having to pay certified mail to confirm my cancellation with them.\n\nI am not a lazy person, and I would have happily stopped by the front desk after my last workout to cancel my membership.  I could have spared 5 minutes of my 7-day vacation to do just that.  The ONLY reason I DIDN'T, was because I was TOLD by the gym that I DIDN'T HAVE TO.  I even repeated it back to them and they CONFIRMED.  \n\nI'm not pissed about being duped $40 for the membership when I live 7 hours south of West Chester.  I'm not pissed about the money I'm going to have to spend this afternoon to drop a certified letter in the mail to officially cancel my membership.  I'm pissed because I was straight up LIED to by the gym - and they acknowledged nothing after the fact.",

I got started back in May and the reviews are great for a reason. It completely lives up to the reviews.  This place is amazing. Brian, who owns the gym is really personable and it seems like he genuinely cares about helping people become the best version of themselves. \n\nRachel's name is mentioned a few times on here, and I'm fortunate enough to have her as my trainer as well. Rachel has a great sense of humor, she's approachable, helpful and she's a fantastic motivator. She's available whenever I text her and has really personalized all my workouts. I feel like she really hears me and is rooting for me. Can you ask for anything else in a personal trainer? She's incredibly knowledgable and helps me understand anything that I have questions about. I look forward to all my sessions with her, but I also look forward to my at-home workouts- she picks exercises that challenge me, but also I'm never bored, and that was important to me. I feel like I came in with a small list of things that were really important to me and all my needs and expectations have not only been met but also exceeded. Cannot recommend PPT enough!",

The free weight room is pretty tight and the machine area is even tighter. All the equipment is brand new. The machines have buttons on it, presumably to count reps and sets but it doesn't work. The cable weights don't have a pin but a lever system. The bad thing is there is only one so folks doing flys using both sides will pretty much take the whole cable machine. The squat rack is way in the back with a mirror behind it. The locker rooms are small, I mean really small. Talk about awkward when changing.",

  "text": "I climbed here several times before finally joining a few months ago.  I used to belong to Vertical Extremes in Downingtown, but switched to Oaks mainly b/c it's much closer to work and home.  I've been to most of the rock gyms in the area (PRG Valley, Vertical Extremes, Doylestown, North Summit in Windgap), and PRG Oaks is smaller than most and also quite popular, which makes it more crowded.  Nonetheless, it's a fine place to climb, and clearly I wouldn't have joined if I didn't like it there.\n\nYou can get stats on number of routes, height, etc. from their site (I don't want to misquote), but the top rope area does feel smaller than most gyms (also a lead-only wall).  The bouldering wall is pretty substantial, mostly overhung to varying degrees, plus a slab bouldering wall.  There's a good variety of top rope routes, and routes along the fake crack are some of my favs.  However, they do seem to lack a certain creativity in setting routes.  I like when a route requires creative technical moves or interesting body positions.  Most of the routes here are more straight up hand-foot-repeat, and difficulty is achieved by tougher and fewer holds, rather than technical maneuvering.  Not to say they're not fun and different - but uniqueness and interestingness could be increased.\n\nThe staff has always been friendly, as has everyone I've talked to in general.  Patrons range from life long climbers, to first timers, to kids' groups.  I'm constantly getting schooled by tweens and old men (but so it goes in climbing).  As I mentioned it gets crowded on week nights, but the large groups tend to clear out by 8pm or so, and the last hour 9-10 is usually pretty empty.  They also have women's climb on Tuesdays and Saturday mornings which I've never gone to but it's a cool idea - any female can come and climb with other women to swap belays, tips, beta, etc.\n\nI disagree with some of the points from another yelper.  I don't find the gym dirty (sure it's chalky and I wouldn't eat off the floor, but it's a gym).  And I don't feel like it's a meat market.  Sure there are some muscle boy boulderings trying to show each other up, but the crowd is diverse and includes plenty of women.\n\nSo a solid 3.5 stars.  More creative routes (that also change more often) would bump it up to 4 stars.",

Have never been a member of the large chain gyms, so I don't have another experience to compare it to.\nWith that said it is a nice gym, generally not crowded, but when it is crowded it can be a hassle to work out because the equipment you want may be in use by someone that doesn't understand the concept of sharing. Earlier this year they rearrange a lot of the equipment to make room for a large barbell setup. The new layout put equipment that I used all the time in odd locations, and now some things are squeezed for space.\nThe one thing that drives me crazy is the music they play...the base clientele here are mostly older 50+..we don't listen to Pop, Hip Hop, Rap Crap, Disco, Dance Club, Top 40 14 yr old mind numbing music!

  "text": "Crux: It's a decent gym, BUT sort of makes me vary to deal with then because of AT&T like CONTRACTS! \n\nSo, I got on to the three month membership plan with this GYM and used it from Nov-15 to Jan-16 and let me start the review by saying that the GYM is fine. I have seen other GYMs which are bigger or better than this one; however, for all my needs and requirements this one sufficed. Do keep in mind though that I was an infrequent visitor and did not use any of the several classes they offer, so take my review about the GYM quality with a grain of salt if you are a frequent user.\n\nNow the reason behind my poor rating. I cancelled my membership here in January '16 and have not been a member since but City Fitness still tried to charge my debit card for February without authorization. I reached out to them and they said that I was on a CONTRACT! Upon resisting the logic I was told that it was a mistake and was assured that this will not be repeated and that they cancelled my membership. \n\nNOW, fast forward 6 months, I receive a letter from a COLLECTION agency for a GYM bill from January to July, and it is ~$500. GYM that hired them- City Fitness! I was surprised to say the least. While I am willing to give the benefit of the doubt that this could be an honest mistake, I am afraid that this might be a repeat behavior since there are several other reviews here that lament similar troubles with City fitness. We expect highest form of professionalism from any business in our neighborhood and I hope City Fitness is quick to resolve this. \n\nTo my fellow Yelpers, I promise to leave an update to this review to keep you posted about how this pans out so you know what to trust and what to best avoid!",

The equipments are in great shape, the facility is air conditioned and clean. The locker is a little small but that's not a deal breaker for me. The staffs are very nice and helpful. Parking can be a little tricky but if you live or work in the area just walk there. I'm just so glad that I came back and I was surprised by all the improvements when I came back.",

  "text": "Beyond frustrated. I've been a member of LA Fitness for about a year and a half. I signed up for personal training sessions about 8 months ago. \n\nFor 6 months I was charged $260/month (for 4 25-minute sessions)... on top of the $43 a month I was paying just to go to this gym. \n\nMy trainer was lazy. Never pushed me. Wouldn't pay attention to set counts. Never set goals with me. Talked the whole time. And never worked on a diet plan with me. He cancelled several sessions on me the morning of and would show up high and reeking of marijuana. Twice now he didn't even call or cancel a session that I showed up for. \n\nAfter my 6months of training was up I was still being charged 260/month for the sessions I still had on my account (that I paid for). \n\nIt's been a stressful last couple months. I finally cancelled my membership and training. Came in at 7am today to use the last training session on my account... which my trainer confirmed last night. And he no call/no showed. I asked the front desk if he called and they didn't seem surprised at his behavior. \n\nFor a \"professional\" Fitness corporation I'm very disappointed. Taking my money to Life Time Fitness even tho it's farther for me to drive.  Will never come back to La",

  "text": "I've been a member of this location since it opened last January. Overall, I've had a good experience here. The facilities and bathrooms are clean, the class schedule is varied, and the gym is not overly crowded if you go off peak hours. Every gym is nuts if you go during peak hours, so this isnt a fault of city fitness. However, my main complaint is the exclusivity of class sizes and how hard it is to get into a class. It has become extremely difficult to enroll in a class (ie barre, bodypump, etc). You have to set your alarm for exactly 25 hours prior to the class time, and if you do not click enroll during the first MINUTE the class fills up. So frustrating. What's even MORE frustrating, though, is that people have been sneaking into classes without being on the list and making the classes even more cramped and crowded. The instructors take attendance and have even called people out for not signing up, but the sneaky people dont leave and it causes the people that actually signed up properly to not have equipment. I primarily use the classes, and its been very frustrating that people have not been signing up and keep sneaking in. For that reason, I cancelled my membership and next month will be my last month.",

Yes it's not 24 hours but who really wants to work out at 3am? I don't mind them closing at 11 because that means it's time for my butt to go to bed! \nMy only complaint is the hot tub has wayyy too much chlorine that it burns my eyes and makes it hard to breathe so I can't stay more than 5 minutes. But I've been around and it seems like that's the case with most gyms. Nice pool, nice equipment, never had a problem with the staff. If something breaks it is usually fixed in a timely manner. \nI personally don't take the classes but I do enjoy the fact that all the classes are included in the membership for free, most gyms charge extra for that sort of thing. Although anytime fitness is closer we don't mind making the drive here! \nPlus this location is in the same plaza as a Publix, Chipotle and First Watch! Bonus points!",

Really friendly and good training partners. The reason for 3 stars is just a way they (all gracie barra's) run their programs. Just not a fan of the fact that you have to buy there gi's or you can't train there. Also, the whole attendance card thing was really weird for me. \nI had just moved to town and was searching for a new school to train at. They allowed me to come try the place out for a day or two. First day was great. Second day...well yeah. The instructor seemed pretty irritated that I didn't have a card (even though i was testing the place out) and that i was wearing one of my old gi's. \nBUT let me be clear, the instructors were exceptional. Just very traditional. Great bunch of guys, just not the right fit for me.",

Then a 30 minute boot camp session on the steps of the art museum which was a collabration with Fit Academy owner/trainer Osayi Osunde (which was brutal).

I am not sure whether or not he got the message about my injury, but even when I explained it to him myself, he failed to suggest any reasonable modification to accommodate my concerns. \nThankfully, a \"class\"mate was kind enough to explain the various moves and answer any questions I had about the class-- again, this person was NOT a Barry's employee but someone PAYING to attend the class.

I usually go before the staff arrives since the gym is conveniently open 24/7, however, when I do see staff members, they are always friendly.  The gym is jam packed with equipment which is a little overwhelming and difficult to maneuver around during workouts, but if you are looking for special equipment they probably have it.  I do wish the old treadmills would disappear and the gym was a little less crowded (equipment). I've never worked out with more than 4-5 people in the gym which is nice as well. Over all I'd recommend but suggest removing some of the equipment that may not be necessary to create a little less of an overwhelming, claustrophobic atmosphere.",

In the summer, the air conditioner breaks and it can get stiffling hot in the exercise room.  In the winter, the roof leaks and there are buckets all over, A couple of times a year, the speakers break and classes sometimes are cancelled.  \nI go for the Zumba.  The Zumba classes at both North and South are loads of fun - I really like the instructors.  Aida is full of energy and enthusiasm.  Keeps you going and burning lots of calories.  Emma works you and you know you've gotten a good workout after having a class with her.  Elvia gives you a real \"feel good\" feeling after taking Zumba with her.\nStaff are always friendly at North and South and greet you and always tell you to have a nice day when leaving.  The gyms are always pretty full with people using the weights.  Bathrooms and showers are clean.  24 hour South has a pool and both places have jacuzzis.  Machines are well maintained and up to date.\nI've been with 24 hour fitness since the early 2000's.  Rates are reasonable.  You get the most out of what you pay if you go.\n5/13/17  I'm upgrading my review to reflect the great workout I got today at both 24 hour fitness North and South with Emma and Aida.  What a team!  I believe the instructors really make the classes and are responsible for members to keep coming back to the classes.  Zumba is my favorite class.  Today the music was lively, easy to keep a beat and definitely sweat producing.  24 hour fitness, focus on your good instructors and I guarantee you'll have members breaking down the doors to come and experience the classes you have to offer!  Great workout - I feel great!",

This is not an exaggeration.  I left a review of my experience on Google and the manager, Jim Dill, left a response telling me to contact him via email.\n\nAs Mr. Dill directed I contacted him by email to ask some questions about the facility and their participation in the Silver Sneakers fitness program for those of us on Medicare.  This is not a \"free\" program - it is something we pay for through our Medicare insurance premiums. Instead of answering some simple questions not answered on their website, Mr. Dill determined my request was unimportant and that any issues or concerns I had were all about his wants and preferences and told me I had to return to the facility to receive answers to my questions.\n\nThinking I might have failed to effectively communicate my needs with him I decided to try it his way again and responded to his insults by letting him know when I'd be by to discuss my issues with him.  Mr. Dill made it clear that he was too important to meet with rifraf like me, but he did provide the name of one of his employees he claimed would assist me.\n\nI arrived at the appointed time, introduced myself to the employee at the front counter, and said I was there to see _____ (name withheld because I was not permitted to see him so have nothing to say about him), the person designated by Mr. Dill to assist me. Although the employee who greeted me was personable and friendly, her only mission was to pump personal information about me into their system.  She refused to contact the person I was there to see until/unless I acquiesced to their invasion of my privacy.\n\nI don't know if it is a failure to communicate within their organization or just the example set by management, but trying to deal with them is about as distasteful as anything I've done in a long time. This is not faulting the employees - they are doing their jobs as the boss tells them to.",

Because issues aren't addressed, people give up trying. Please don't confuse a lack of complaints with improvement of the situation. \n\nFor example, for years we have asked for more cooling in the spin room and have been told an additional fan was about to be installed. Never happened. Same with the room used for yoga. We were actually told the room would be cooled for \"actual exercise\" classes. We were also told that each instructor was asked and said the temperature was perfect. Odd that each instructor has asked us to complain to management about the heat- it's very stuffy always and uncomfortably hot most of the year. Members have requested better cooling all the way up to corporate. \n\nAlso, we have asked repeatedly if while yoga is in session, racquetball players could be asked to use a court other than the one that shares a common wall with the yoga room- assuming one is available. We have been told that is not a fair request to make to those members. None have ever objected the move when we ask so how hard could it be to post a sign on the door during yoga classes or assign a different court? \n\nThere are lots of classes offered and the yoga and spin classes I take are great. Especially Liz and Sunday morning yoga. She puts a lot into her classes including use of blocks, straps and essential oils. \n\nLA Fitness is a value for the monthly rate for sure. The Marana management and front desk staff needs an adjustment.",

When I walk in I am made to feel like a celebrity by the staff (although I kinda am)... they greet me by name, they know my family (we all go).  The members are all really nice, they speak or nod and smile.  \n\nThe classes are AMAZING!!!   From yoga with Sati and Juanita, to Zumba with Gail G, to asskicking---- I mean kickboxing--- with Mark.  It's great!  All levels are made to feel comfortable but pushed.  I've gone to several different gyms and have never felt the level of comfort I feel when I'm here.  \n\nClean facility, warm pool and hot hot tub with clouds on the ceiling and peaceful music.  Good exercise equipment, nice tvs. I can't say anything bad.  Well, parking is sometimes a challenge as other businesses use the same lot, but if you are patient you will find something.  \n\nLove it!!",

If you enjoy fitness, getting our butt kicked and rocking out to awesome tunes - this is the studio for you. \n\nMy absolute favorite classes are the Friday happy hours with Chris S. He's the perfect combination of entertaining and energy that one needs when they're getting their pre-weekend work out. \n\nThe studio offers shoes to allow for a better ride when you're clipped in. Be sure to take advantage of the water bottle and snacks pre or post ride to energize your bod! As a note: check the weight of your bar at your bike - could come in hand for the arm part of the 50 min ride. \n\nAll in all the technology and cycle stats that comes post ride really allow you to monitor your own success. It's always your ride - but the instructors encourage you to push yourself! \n\nBig fan. I'll be back many times!",

  "text": "I recently signed up for this gym and hopefully Yelping about it will be another step to hold myself accountable. Daniel and I have been talking about joining a gym and getting fit for awhile now, but it wasn't until his coworkers all started coming to this location that we got motivated to check it out.\n\nFrench Riviera is on the entire second floor of a retail building. There isn't a sign for it in the parking lot, so you kind of have to be paying attention for the lit up upper floor and big red signage. The space is very large and has lots of different machines, as well as quite a few multiples of popular ones (treadmills, bikes, etc). They have a lot of televisions set to different channels, any of which you can listen to by plugging your earphones into the machines. The women's and men's locker rooms apparently are both connected to a sauna and spa, although I have not checked that out because I don't really know what that is. It makes me think of the scene in Gilmore Girls where everyone's wearing towels and Luke has to convince the town elders to sell him a house. \n\nOne of the biggest draws for me is that French Riviera has a ladies only workout section! There is a smaller enclosed room that it for women only, with weights, machines, bikes, treadmills, etcetera, which is nice when you don't want to be ogled and/or feel intimidated by male Jersey Shore emulators grunting and sweating (tragically, no Snooki look-a-likes have yet been spotted).\n\nThey also offer a variety of classes throughout the week, from yoga and pilates, to cycling (which looks super intense), and Zumba, which looks like, to me, aerobics dancing mixed with hip hop and cumbia/salsa? Attending classes is included in the cost of membership, and they offer them from morning until evening. \n\nThe customer service is excellent. We were welcomed, taken on a tour, then allowed to work out before going to into any details about joining etcetera. Brandon C. is awesome; since I have never worked out before, he actually gave me an orientation (before we even signed up or paid or anything), on how to use various machines, explaining what weights did what to which muscles (clearly I don't really get this yet), and advising me on how many repetitions to do, paying attention to what hurt, etcetera. \n\nBecause we brought in an online free trial membership, we were able to sign up on our first visit for $50 registration. Other gyms I've looked at in the past such as Anytime cost at least $100! And our monthly rate is $32, again, less than my friends pay at Anytime, or what my sister pays in Atlanta for LA Fitness. \n\nFor those who are afraid to make the drive to Metairie, never fear! There is a location on Carrollton and Earhart, and also they are supposedly opening one in Gentilly soon. They also have 2 locations on the West Bank (including one on Behrman right by Hong Kong Market). However, Metairie's is definitely open 24 hours, while I'm not sure about the other. \n\n*Another note on customer service: Last night, I lost a necklace given to me by my sister for my birthday. I was really upset and went to look in my car and in the parking lot. The girl working the front desk saw and asked me what I was looking for, then went around the whole gym with me to check for it, even though I had only just started working out. She checked under machines, in the couch... sadly we did not find it but it made me happy that she tried so hard and told me that if anyone turned it in, they would definitely let me know. \n\n**Yelp Tip For Non iPhone Users!: Sign up for a Free Trial here, http://rivierafitnesscenters.com/member_free.asp, print your ticket, then bring it on your FIRST visit. It'll allow you to register for $50 instead of $165. Again, ask for Brandon C.; I think he's only there Monday, Wednesday, and Friday but I know he will get you the best deal he can. \n\nAlso, mention my name as a reference because you like me!",

The gym does waiver between clean and gross on a daily basis. I've gone to the gym right when it opens in the morning, to find bottles of water and tissues on the floor, and equipment where it doesn't belong (e.g., weight room equipment in the training area, equipment attachments strewn everywhere). It is clear that the gym does not always get cleaned in the evening after closing or before opening in the morning. There also appears to be high attrition with the personal trainers, which would lead me to believe that it is not the greatest place to work. \n\nI do hope I see an improvement or I will have to take my business elsewhere.",

This is the best thing I can say about this gym. \n\nFrom the 10-year-old, half broken equipment, to the ridiculous heat (no matter what the weather), to the few tvs that work and have seven ESPN channels, 2 HG TV channels and no football, to the slanted floors that bounce up and down if too many people are working out at once, I only go here when it's not nice enough out to work out outside. Not to mention the \"annual membership contract\" which they'll charge you an arm and a leg for if you try to quit before the annual period is up (though I only remember singing something four years ago when I joined and was unaware it renewed annually at the same rate--that is until they feel like increasing it, which has happened once or twice with no new equipment or classes to justify the fee--and the $25 a year maintenance fee which Lord does doesn't pay for maintenance there at all. \n\nLiterally if they were any better options I would take them. And I might just buy a workout tape and start working out at home rather than have to go there anymore.\n\nThe locker room is tiny and there's almost always a male staff member in there after work. So, yeah, I don't recommend it.",

Yes, you get a gym and a pool, but the weight room is not sufficient for power lifters and it's deceptively small. So, good luck training at any time except during off hours. Also, many machines have weight stacks that I swear are designed for only children and the elderly. \n\nIt is very hard for an experienced lifter to get a decent workout in at this gym with any exercise variety.",

  "text": "It all started with a text from my sister asking me if I wanted to accompany her to a spin class. \"It's free for first timers..\"= SOLD. But hours after the Tabata Spin Class with Carly, I realize I would've paid the regular full price for my experience in a heartbeat.\nWhen I tell you that this was one of the most positive experiences I have had in any sort of fitness class, I am not exaggerating. Carly was happy to help my new-to-cycling sister and I in adjusting our bikes, and explaining all of the terminology she would be using during her class. She was particularly mindful of my injuries (lumbar back spasm and degeneration of left knee cartilage) as she adjusted me into my bike, and reminded me to not forget that this was \"my ride\" and to listen to my body, above all. The next 30 minutes was a blur of sweat, music, encouragement, challenge, and accomplishment. It was HARD, and I certainly burned some fat (that was the whole point for me!!), but I was UNINJURED, thanks to Carly's sensitivity. She repeatedly dismounted from her bike to make sure I was okay without making me feel like a leper or an invalid. I got the workout I wanted and needed so desperately, without the injury I feared.\nPost class, I was delighted that Carly and the owner (I can't remember his name, but he was so sweet!) stayed and chatted with my sister and I. Carly gave me some tips on strengthening my core to help buffer the pain I experience in my back. The owner was happy to answer the million and one questions my sister and I had for him regarding spinning and the studio, and seemed genuinely delighted that we had such a wonderful experience.\nThere is not a single doubt in my mind: I WILL be back!!!!",

  "text": "I was a member of City Fitness for two years, and paid them a good deal of money for semi-private personal training (think hundreds of dollars a month).\n\nOne note: my trainers (Ryan, who has left, and Dan, who still works there) were both great. I loved working out with them, and saw fantastic results in a short time. Twice a week was enough for me gain strength, tone and stamina.\n\nThe facilities themselves are okay. Not fantastic, but not bad. The locker rooms stink, and the showers are gross. They offer no towels, terrible mirror area and other amenities. The machines are new and I could usually find one to use, which was good.\n\nClass options are few and far between, but Body Pump and the 20/20/20 one were fun. Spinning was also decent.\n\nWhy one star then? This place is run unethically beyond belief. I'm a patient and forgiving person, but cannot believe how I was treated when I left. Keep in mind my office MOVED so I no longer am anywhere near the gym. I didn't leave out of unhappiness or for a negative reason, but was forced to do so and choose a gym closer to my new office.\n\nWhen it came time to cancel, I gave them 30 days notice on my training. I have my signed contract which requires NO notice, but was then told I had a pending payment in 21 days that could not be canceled. Essentially I'd have 8 more sessions than I could use, nothing around that. While I was annoyed, I figured I could use them up at some point in the future.\n\nFast forward to 12 weeks later. I've been charged TWO extra times, $199 each, and have called them now 11 times. That is not an exaggeration. I've spoken to several employees, all who agree these are incorrect charges and I should be refunded. I was even told that the refund was processed, but it's been nearly two weeks since and I see nothing on my credit card statement.\n\nLet me make this clear: BEWARE of City Fitness. They are worse about treating past clients with respect than any gym I've ever been a member of, including large and infamously negative chains. They WILL keep charging you and if you aren't diligent about it they won't stop. \n\nAt this point I've been forced to contact my credit card company and file chargeback requests, as well as the BBB. Not something I wanted to do but how else was I supposed to get my money back?\n\nSuper, super disappointing, especially considering what a great member I was for so long. Oh well...you win some you lose some.",

I love Lilly's Aerial Yoga classes because it's a totally different way of doing yoga.  You are doing similar poses, but are using the silks (which are the aerial fabrics) to provide support and resistance. Classes are hard but Lilly is a great instructor and makes sure everyone is practicing safely.\n\nThe best part is learning 'tricks'. Some poses have you hanging upside-down. A few weeks ago we learn how to wrap ourselves up at the top of the silk and then flip down landing upside-down with only our legs still in the silk. I love that it's a workout and an adventure!",

Small locker rooms of you want to lock up your stuff (blow dryers, deodorant hair ties too) or cubbies inside the work out space. 2 bathrooms and 3 large shower rooms equipped with fancy toiletries.\n\nStaff super friendly and walked me through a short tutorial of what to expect. They advertise special treadmills which means nothing to me but after using them they really do feel different than the usual treadmills (in a good way!) There is a tv screen in front of the treadmill that gives you options for easy medium hard (easy proved to be quite challenging for me!) and also simulates a running course somewhere in the US that makes it more interesting than looking at the wall. Each interval feels hard but doable and before you know it 15 min is over and time to hit the weights for 15min before repeating treadmill and weights again and bam 60 minutes is already finished!\n\nI hate the treadmill. I don't love running. But I didn't mind this treadmill workout at all...They switch up the focus of the weights daily so you don't exhaust any one bit of your body if you go frequently which I love. I'm looking forward to my next class!",

I had the privilege of working with them for an entire summer and I couldn't be more grateful.\n\nIf you haven't met these two driven people yet (Charbel and Katie), you need to take the time to do so, because you WILL NOT regret it. Their business model and values are those of which that need to be replicated everywhere.\n\nTheir class style is a butt whooping you won't forget. They have 1 hour classes which consists of alternating between 15 minutes of weight training/body weight exercises and 15 minutes of cardio, and repeat! They have really fun energetic classes with great workout music and knowledgeable trainers. Try to go to Katie or Charbel's classes if you can as they are the geniuses behind this place and you are likely to get the full experience.\n\nThere are locker rooms to store your stuff, bathrooms and showers available as well. They have class times all day from 6am to 8pm so you're likely to find something that fits your schedule. They even do express workouts during lunch which are 45 mins.\n\nYou can try your first class free which is worth at least stopping in for. You most likely have not worked out like this before and will be in for a treat.",

  "text": "My tour de fit continues and my latest stop was Barry's Bootcamp in the Gulch. This class is hard, but it doesn't necessarily have to be. You can push yourself as hard as you want. The class is divided into two groups. Some start on the treadmill and some start on the floor. You spend half the class jogging, running, and sprinting and the other half doing floors exercises. If you want to run on a 10 with an 8 incline, do it. If you want to run on a 5 with no incline, it's your workout! The instructor was super motivating and kept the class moving along seamlessly. It's impressive because you have large groups of people crisscrossing from the treadmill to the floor, back to the treadmill, and back to the floor or the reverse. It was also Britney versus day and Toxic will really get you moving on the treadmill.\n\nThe facilities are super clean and the showers were spacious. They also provide towels which is a HUGE plus in my book. I hate lugging around a wet towel. You also sweat a ton and there is a real chance here to lose a lot of calories. This place will kick your butt. I could not walk the following day, but it was worth it!",

  "text": "Finally went for a work-out as a guest of a friend.   I still haven't gone through the sales pitch, so I can't speak for the attitude/etc. of management.\n\nMy friend who took me as a guest really loves it.  They still have a $10 down and $10/month special going on, but I don't know how long the special will last, or how long the $10/month is good for.\n\nBased on my past experience with Cardinal Fitness, here's my view of the financial aspect.  A gym business cannot stay in business charging only $10 a month or even $20/month.    They will be forced to eventually (within a year of opening) raise rates at least to $25/month, assuming they still have a bunch of people who join but don't go.\n\nIf they can't make a profit on a large percentage of members who are \"people-who-join-but-don't-go\", then they will have to charge in the range of $30/month and up. \n\nRight now, everything is brand new. Plenty of TV screens (choose the audio on the dashboard of your exercise machine).   Lots of treadmills, ellipticals, bikes, recumbent bikes, weight machines, and free weights.\n\nThere is a stretching and situp area.   And a special timed cardio area, that i forget the name of, and don't remember the name of the stations. You switch stations every 60 seconds or something like that. \n\nAt the present time, there is a good mix of regular average people, overweight people, fit people, and \"muscle heads\".   There were some *serious* bodybuilders when I went.  \n\nThere are some water-massage tables, and a couple massage chairs that you pay extra for (coin operated things).\n\nSee the hours I mentioned in previous review.\n\nThere are three places in the neighborhood that are closer to me (Peak Performance, Anytime Fitness, and Liv Rite Fitness).   But this place (Planet) is not enough to get me to go further out of my way.   \n\nActually, i'm just using my apartment fitness center because it's free.   But if I were to pay, I'd go to Liv Rite as first choice, or to Anytime Fitness if I needed 24-hour access.\n\nOne reason to join Planet Fitness, and the same applies to Anytime Fitness, is that they are national chains, and for an extra monthly fee, you can buy an option that gets you access to all nation-wide locations.   So if you travel regularly, and those places have franchises at your destinations, check them out.",

Your child starts off on a smaller wall and gradually makes his or her way up to the larger ones as the weeks progress(they're in a harness while a guide watches over them). \n\nNot only is it fun for your child but it teaches them discipline,structure, and gets rid of a lot of energy! \n\nWe plan on signing him up again in the near future. \n\nDefinitely check this place out for yourself or your child.",

Be warned!\n\nFirst I will tell you how they wrongfully took my money then I will tell you about their bad classes.\n\nI got a groupon for some classes. When I called on the phone to book them, they offered me another promotion for $30. I told them I already had the Groupon but they said it was fine and I could do both. After using the second, lower valued, promotion the manager told me I couldn't use the first one I got and to ask for a refund online. I went on Groupon and there was no way to get a refund.\n\nSurprise surprise. \n\nThey followed that conversation with a sales pitch that I couldn't get away from that was about 30 minutes.\n\nI went back to the gym to follow up and the staff told me they had no idea who I spoke to and they can't help me. They were really rude about it too. I described the guy I spoke to and they still said they didn't know him. Then I opened up Yelp to show them the picture and they said something to the tune of \"oh yeah, he is the owner. We still can't help you\". Many months and emails later, still no refund. Blatantly scamming me out of a meager $30.\n\nNow the classes:\nThe first one was okay besides some microphone problems. I was the only guy in the class but that was quite alright with me. The trainer showed us the moves and I had a good workout. It was crowded though. At one point some lady stepped on me and was kind of rude about it.\n\nMy second class was an evening class. It was just me and one other guy. The trainer didn't push us too hard. I had a good workout but not as good.\n\nThe third class was garbage. I brought my girlfriend who had never done any kind of fighting. There was a one minute introduction to show her the moves and that's it. After that the trainer used a broken microphone to verbalize drills and never show us. I couldn't really hear him and my girlfriend was totally lost. Plenty of people there didn't know how to do the moves correctly and they were all hopelessly copying each other. Bad experience.\n\nI highly recommend that anybody who likes this gym goes over to Everybody Fights instead. The customer service is way better and so are the facilities and training. It's like night and day and it is about the same price. CKO doesn't even have a locker room. Never going back!",

It's like we are all part of a little workout family. \n\nThe best thing about this gym is that you pay one monthly fee for unlimited classes, which are as effective (and as fun!) as personal training sessions. They offer their weekly class schedule both in hard copy at the gym or online. \n\nI work out for free at PSC Highpoint because I'm an employee there, so the fact that I'm willing to pay for another gym just goes to show you how much I love UFC Gym. \n\nThey welcome guests, so you can try a few classes for free before committing. As far as kickboxing gyms go, this one is not outrageously priced. You pay a $130 activation and start-up fee and then $79 a month. Places like Highpoint offer $20 a month memberships (without certain privileges--like towels) but you pay an annual fee plus a $250 start-up fee on top of that. Plus the management staff at UFC is WAY more approachable and friendly. \n\nYes, sometimes they seem pushy when trying to sign you up. Hello? That's what they're supposed to do!

I've taken about 30 classes and I only had one experience that made me not want to return. \n\nAs a professional dancer with a degree in kinesiology and having lupus, i listen to my body and modify based on what my needs are and how I'm feeling. As a movement teacher I can understand calling someone out if they risk injury but this was not that. I made a slight modification to a movement to direct attention to my core instead of my hip flexor (because I was recovering from a recurs femoris avulsion fracture - or simply put a broken hip) seemed like common sense to not force the injury \"to failure\". On the loud speaker Josh continues to shout \"i like what you are doing, great form but that's not what we are doing\" until I realized he was shouting at me. I just stopped working out at that point and looked at him with confusion. I'm not going to risk my livelihood to be bullied by some bro. While this is going on there are literally people in the class who have no body awareness and are using weights way too heavy for them with their back so arched I'm hurting looking at them. I struggle to focus on my workout when there are people injuring themselves right before my eyes. It was like this in every class. Lots of egos and bad postures. He was condescending in his delivery and my opinion is he should have been more concerned with those new to exercise destroying their knees and QLs. He spent the beginning of the class looking in the mirror and flirting with clients when I would recommend he ask the class if anyone has any injuries or conditions that may need modifications. I would take anyone else's class but his. He's a total bro. I continued to go and changed my schedule to avoid needing to take his class. I share this to say, personally I don't think the structure at Barry's provides attention to detail for those new to exercise and would recommend a few personal training sessions before attending a class to learn basic form. The female instructors were great about providing modifications and would even show moves after class if you had questions. I do love the work out but it's not safe for people who have no body awareness. Maybe an introduction class could be the answer.",

  "text": "I've been coming here since April 2011, and I am new to Crossfit. The trainers here have been very accommodating and wiling to help a newbie like me. This gym has a nice mix of normal people, buffed out ripped people, and all the in-betweens. \n\nThe trainers are not super assertive/aggressive (like Centurian Crossfit in Sac), but they are always present to lend a helping hand, explain a move, or just coach you on. \n\nThe best thing about this gym is the easy going start times. You are not locked into a specific time; just set an appointment with your trainer/coach, and you can move through the workouts individually, or coordinate with other clients. This is great flexibility, and real plus to use this gym vs. others. \n\nGive this gym a try, and go for the bootcamp series if you're new to CrossFit. I did it, and I found it a good way to ease into the series. Honestly, after the first two weeks, I thought I'd been hit by a car. Now though, I find the workouts challenging, but not devastating like before.\n\nGood gym, and an excellent location for anyone in the northwest Reno area.",

I've had 2 trainers so far because one left to school. They were/are both friendly, motivating and knowledgeable. Lots of fine equipment, space, and clean.\n\nUpdate: I moved out of St. Louis and sadly had to leave The Lab. I gained almost 5 lbs of muscle during my time there and lost a similar amount of fat (they do assessments which measure).

On top of that, charging $15 per 5 year old just so they can use all the areas other than the \"toddler areas\" which is a joke, is just high way robbery.  On top of that, they wanna charge me $15 to jump with my kids, which is more like paying $15 to be near my kids rather than jump.  After tax, we were at $60 dollars.   I would suggest if you are coming here to either be okay with your 5 year olds to be cool with one little jump area to keep cost down, or have deep pockets for an hour of entertainment.",

But I quickly realized once I got in that it was because everyone was scrambling to get a shady spot to set their things. They had quite a few chairs but not a ton of shade. I kind of wish they had a few more umbrellas or something so people with little kids had a place to go if their kiddos got too hot or needed a rest in the shade. Guess you just have to stand in line 30 min early for that.\n\nThe park itself was nice. There was something for all ages and abilities. I was worried my 3 year old wouldn't be able to do much since he isn't great at swimming yet but there was a ton for his age level and size. He loved the kiddie slide/kiddie pool area. My older kid enjoyed the water slides and water surfing.\n\nWe didn't try the food because the line was too long. But overall it's a nice clean park and I'd come back for sure.

Whenever I travel, I try to workout in a local CF box and, though I've definitely drunk the Crossfit koolaid, I'm not equally impressed by every box I visit.\n\nThe trainers here are top notch and take all of their athletes seriously -- even new folks who aren't in great shape and have crazy injuries.

If this Crossfit is close enough for you to make it a part of your regular routine and you've been thinking about joining a gym but don't even know where to start, you owe it to yourself to check it out... it won't feel good at first, and you will get your butt kicked, but if you go regularly and try hard, you'll probably be in the best shape of your life within a couple months.",

At first we saw a half dozen kids on the court playing basketball with a camp counselor. \n\nWhere the problem came in was that the \"flotation\" area was swarmed with about 15-20 additional kids just running all over that area, acting poorly, and being chaotic. Yes there were two camp counselors \"overseeing\" these kids, meaning they were either sitting on the sofas or standing around. Not telling the kids they weren't behaving appropriately or stop running up the slides and jumping on the outside area of the safari one.\n\nIt just wasn't fair that they were behaving so terrible and there was no one acknowledging that. The counselors shirts said Incredi-plex, but there wasn't other employees keeping an eye out for the other people not with the camp. It was a free for all.\n\nAfter that they bombarded the obstacle course and finally it was time for them to have lunch and they picked up their shoes that had been thrown about. It gave my kids a chance to play, but shortly after that we had to go.\n\nIt was all so frustrating, and after seeing the lack of supervision and the chaos, I don't have any desire to return there.",

After the year when I went to cancel that contract the managers avoided my phone calls and sent me in circles to keep me on the month-by-month. I finally kept to it and Glenn and Brandon cancelled my contract as I paid all debts. Today I received a letter in the mail by their corporate office saying that I owe Fitness Connection $344.00. I contacted both Glenn and Brandon who no longer work there and they seem frustrated because they legitimately did their job but the upper management didn't acknowledge my cancellation. I contacted my former personal trainer and he can't believe it. I called the Corporate Office and they are avoiding me. I called Fitness Connection on Disc Drive and they avoided me. Finally I drove over there and they still tried to avoid me. Cowards. I then drove over there and marched into the manager's office unannounced and talked to the Manager with the Marine Corps emblem attached to his desk. I think his name was Brad. He even implied I was in the right but basically said, \"too bad, so sad, we didn't finalize your cancelation so you owe us $344.\" Basically, they didn't push the papers and think I owe them money and seem proud they tricked me because I legitimately never received a letter of cancelation in the mail. Additionally, the desk clerk was sarcastic and rude to me and I told him this matter isn't funny and if he values his job maybe he should just mind his business. He shut up real fast. Too bad for them I still have a collage of evidence and paperwork. They won't get a dime out of me. I thought United States Marines practice integrity and honor? He actually looked proud that Fitness Connection did this to me. So this is how you treat your consumers? The funny thing is, I have the witnesses, paperwork, handwritten and signed notes, text messages, facebook messages to protect me from that illegal $344. debt they think I owe them. Perhaps the Marine Corps emblems posted in their office is to sway people into believing they are trustworthy? This kind of greed by trying to steal from consumers is the reason why our economy went down in the first place. If anybody wants to pickett in front of this branch in protest to their illegal business practices on Disc Drive, my name is Robert Mead--feel free to contact me and we'll get on it. Hey Fitness Connection (scum bags), you have so much competition in this region that you are screwed. Hey Fitness Connection, look at your Yelp scores, I'm not the only one making Yelp posts like this. Get with the times, consumers look at Yelp these days before making financial commitments. Please remove your Marine Corps emblems from your offices because this is insulting and disgraceful to run a business like this with a sacred emblem like that. Disgraceful.",

Mounds of treadmills, ellipticals, exercise bikes, rowing machines, stair climbing machines, a 25-foot rock climbing wall, a running track, basketball courts, lap lanes for swimming, yoga/workout rooms, free weights, resistance machines, and a huge leisure pool, complete with slides!  \n\nNow I know what you're thinking.  \"But I've been to [insert your municipality's workout center here] and it has cool stuff too!\".  And I'll say hey I understand.  I've been to The Heights in Richmond Heights.  I've been to Centennial Commons in U City.  They're nice, but nothing like this.  There's a busyness at the CoC, a sense that things are happening.  And others can sense it too.  There's almost always lots of activity going on.  People who work out there take exercise seriously.\n\nSo as with just about every place in Clayton, the CoC is a place to see and be seen.  People dress up to work out.  Guys show off their latest Under Armour purchase and women show off...well they show off what they got.  I wouldn't say it's snobbish, just it's obvious that a lot of people who go there have a few bucks to spare.\n\nFor a facility as large and complete as the CoC, I expected a much higher fee.  As it stands, it's only $35/month for residents, and $50/month for non-residents.  There's a small rate increase if you go month-to-month instead of paying for a full year, but there are no high pressure sales tactics, just set it up, pay, and go.  Heck, I used to pay $50/month to jog at the smelly sweat-box of Bally's, dodging meatheads and soccer moms.  CoC has them beat, hands down.\n\nSo as you can imagine with the setup they have, things can sometimes get a little hectic.  During the heavy hours (5 to 7PM), they're so busy there's sometimes a (short) wait for workout equipment.  They have signup sheets to keep things orderly, and you can only use the equipment for a half hour before you have to re-signup.  It's a little annoying, and sometimes people \"cheat\" by signing up for equipment they won't use, but in the end it usually works out and people are generally respectful of the time.  Personally, I've never had to wait more than about 10 minutes for a machine, which is more than enough time to stretch or warm up on your own.\n\nThe CoC also seems to get the little things right.  The layout is easy to follow and is seamless.  The locker rooms are huge.  They have a daycare area where employees can watch your kids while you work out.  There's a Subway restaurant in the building.  Flat panel TV's line the walls.  There's a good mix of artificial and natural lighting.  Employees are kind and respectful.  There's plenty of parking.  No matter how crowded it is, there's always a nook or cranny you can find if you need to step away from the madness for a few.  The machines are continually replaced and upgraded.\n\nPeople may have personal favorites, but it seems like the CoC gets everything right.  Exercising shouldn't feel like going to work.  This place has a buzz, an energy about it that will make even the laziest couch potato contemplate lacing up and hitting the floor.  If every workout facility was like this, Hostess would go out of business.",

Andy gave us our  tour and we were very impressed with how it was completely informational and NOT a sales pitch. They sit you down at the very end and explain the two plans very thoroughly and leave you to decide.. that's it! This is EXACTLY what we were looking for in a gym and signed up as soon as we got home. We had to call back a couple times due to a system glitch they were having at the time and they were very friendly and helpful and called back when they said they would. Super impressed and excited to start working out after going so long without a gym due to the usual BS you have to go through. =D",

  "text": "I used to go to the LA Fit on First Avenue - for almost ten years I have done this - and I'm so glad I don't have to go there anymore since I moved to Oro Valley! This location is awesome compared to the other locations. The equipment is new, the gym is very clean, and it is rarely crowded. The other locations I have been to have not offered free Wi-Fi - but this location does, and it works, so I can listen to music and watch movies on the treadmill without eating up data. One complaint I do have - MOST of the treadmills shake distractingly when I run at a good pace. I am a thin person so it has nothing to do with weight - the damn things get unstable if I run at any speed greater than 7.0-7.5 mph. It causes me to step off the treadmill during my run and go find another one, only to find that most of them have the same problem. I brought this up to the management and they just shrugged it off, saying that's just how that model of the treadmill is. Well, like I said, I've been going to LA Fitness for many years and never had this problem with the treadmills at the other locations. Definitely an annoyance! Other than that - good gym.",

Each workout was fresh and creative - never boring or repetitive.  The instructors are enthusiastic and encouraging from 5 AM till 7 PM (particularly Eric, Arnold, and Brad).   The instructors give excellent form critiques - which is quite the task considering the diversity of athletic experience among their clientele.  The workouts are designed to challenge anyone who walks through the door, and they certainly challenged me!  I was never disappointed or left wanting more.  There is emphasis on core, scapular stabilizers, and glutes - which as a physical therapist, I appreciate SO much.  I cannot recommend this gym enough.  It has helped keep me strong, healthy, and happy for the last three years.  It's something special...a real gem!",

They have a wide variety of weight equipment, I was like a kid in a candy store, trying out equipment that I had never seen before.  If I lived in the area, this would definitely be my home gym.  I normally do not shower at the gym, but since I was visiting the area, I decided to bring a change of clothes with me.  The bathrooms and shower stalls were clean the only issue I had which I did not notice until after I had already disrobed was that the body wash dispenser was very low, so much so that I had to push on it several times to try to pump soap out of the dispenser.  That was disappointing because the shower gel smelled really good.  After I dressed, I went to the ONSITE restaurant.  I ordered a protein smoothie, they have more than enough flavors to chose from and my smoothie was plant based which made me very happy.  They also meal prep and serve food.",

  "text": "When signing up you have a contract for one year, and after that you become a month-to-month member. There is probably some cancellation fee if you cancel within that first year, but when you cancel as a month-to-month you have to pay for the next 60 days (2 months). I have read numerous stories about horrible experiences while cancelling your membership and suggest keeping track of any and all paperwork you receive from this establishment. I was a member August 2014 - August 2015 and then I cancelled; I still have to pay for September and October because of the 60-Day-cancellation bullpoop scam that most gyms have in place. Hopefully I don't run into any issues with continuous charges after October (I've cancelled my credit card that they were charging for the year as a precaution). \n\nBe careful if you sign up for EFT/Resolution Training.. I really suggest you don't make the same mistake I made and get talked into it by one of the sales people. They will try to offer you a free session/consultation, but it really will be a great 20 minute workout, then they'll drag you into the office and ask which package you would like to purchase. You will be so winded and amazed you might agree to start paying the extra $200/month for $50 thirty minute training appointments. You may pay $50, but the trainer only gets about $7-$10 for the session. So you will expect a $50 session, but receive a $7 training session (I'm talking quality). I signed up for training in the Lawrenceville location.. I had one young woman trainer say at the start of our first appointment \"Let me tell you a little about why I'm qualified to be your trainer..\" (OK..?) ...then she began to talk to me about her stalker ex-boyfriend who broke her jaw in college while I sat there waiting for my workout. My next trainer (also in Lawrenceville) was anywhere from 10-30 minutes late to 3 out of our 5 appointments (yes 30 minutes late.. meaning he missed the entire appointment without warning). Most of the times he was late was because he was hanging around completely aloof that he even had a client waiting on him. If you want good personal training you should find a real personal trainer not commissioned by this terrible service. Their website gympayment . com is quite faulty and will drop appointments without warning and incorrectly keep track of what sessions you have left. Also, they have an automatic renewal  aspect to the contract.. so if you just HAVE to sign up.. be careful when cancelling.\n\nThe membership allows you to go to multiple locations, which is nice if you have a crazy schedule and find yourself in different towns at any day of the week; there are different aspects to each gym.. some locations offer classes, tanning, daycare, etc.. included in the membership... other's don't. Some have showers.. some don't.. The equipment varies from place to place. And many of the gyms are way too hot (the air systems are terrible). These opinions have been formed from the Kenilworth, Lawrenceville, Mercerville, Moorestown, Whippany, and Clark locations.\n\nYou get what you pay for.. so it's up to you.. written above are my personal disappointments.. make what you want of them..",

I went on the 7/4 holiday weekend with a team of 6 adults and I must say it was still enjoyable.  \n\nThe lazy river was a bit more crowded than you usually see (from what I remember as a child at water parks) but not suffocatingly so.  There were slide options with diving boards a small child area.  This would be a great place to take your family.  Admission was $8 for adults and I want to say $6 for kids but there is a yearly pass option as well.  I don't believe you can bring in outside food and drink but the concession stand is not overly expensive (1-6 dollar range per item).  The line for concessions was terribly long but I have a sneaky suspicion the park was crowded due to the holiday and not generally that populated.  A friend described the place as a \"child's summertime mecca\".  That explains it really well.  For adults, good for a group activity probably not great for a relaxing time alone soaking up sun.\n\nReally good option for an Indy (all ages/group) summer activity since beaches are scarce (if any).",

  "text": "Just like all the other reviews here, Future Fitness gives you the hard sell.  It is an antiquated sales pitch that at times can be insulting.  They use bait and switch tactics to get you in the door, i.e $1.00 down $10/month.  However, these cheap rates change in two months to a much higher price.  During the sales pitch they use terms like, \"do you really need your wife here to make a decision about your fitness.\"  When they are asking you to spend thousands of dollars up front, yes, I'm going to consult my spouse.  They make you take a tour to show you all the equipment they have and I was told repeatedly, \"can't you feel the excitement in this place?\"  There were not many people in the gym during my tour so I had no idea what he was talking about.  Be prepared to spend over an hour if you want to sign up.\n\nI did end up joining because I use it for the pool and other cardio equipment.  I negotiated a significant reduction in monthly fees and used the AAA discount.  Don't be intimadated by the used car salesman tactics and push for a $30-$40/month commitment.\n\nPros - not very many people in the gym so you have access to lots of equipment.  I go to the Cherry Hill Rte 70 location. They have lots of cardio equipment both upstairs and downstairs.  Secondly, they have a large workout space to do various high intensity exercises.  Finally, they have a pool which i use to train in.  It is a small pool but it works\n\nCons - I have many.....so I'll list\n1. The trainers that roam around with clients are constantly yelling at each other and joking around.  It can be very annoying when working out\n2. Jump ropes, kettle balls, TRX machine can only be used if you are working with a trainer.  This costs extra $$$.  They explained that this stuff gets stolen??\n3. Much of the cardio machines have TV's on them but not all of them work at times.  Some of the cardio equipment is old and does not work right.  When asked to fix these machines it takes forever to be addressed.\n4. They have 3 universal machines downstairs but only enough attachments for for about 1.5 machines.  People are constantly moving the bars and ropes around during your sets\n5. Tons of nautilus machines that no one uses.  This is a big selling point when signing up from the staff but only older people use these machines.\n6. Only one rack of dumbbells.  Need more in the other areas of the gym.\n7. Lots of foreigners working out in jeans, khakis, etc despite a published dress code\n8.  5-10% of the members wipe down machines.  This is really disgusting.  They need to place disinfecting wipes around the gym.  Instead they have brown paper towels with spray bottles that no one uses and aren't good at wiping down machines anyway.\n9. No hand sanitizer dispensers",

  "text": "I'll happily update this review should things change, but right now I'm pretty pissed at City Fitness.  \n\nI should have been wary in Dec 07, when first walking in to sign up for an account, there was a customer yelling about his account at the front desk.  I should have walked right away!\n\nSo the deal at the time was $99 to sign up and $59.99 a month thereafter.  I am an avid reader of contracts, and I pointed out the many loopholes to them before signing it.  I was assured it was a very casual contract, they were a neighborhood business, and they weren't going to screw anyone over.  What a convincing little song and dance.  Well, I believe in giving people (especially neighbors, and so called \"neighborhood businesses\") the benefit of the doubt, so I signed up because they were conveniently located and had yoga classes.  And for 6 months, I happily went to my yoga classes and paid my bills.  \n\n...Until one day I come in and find out it's going to cost an additional $10 a month (in the middle of my contract!!) to continue to attend those yoga classes.  Pretty shady, right?  Whatev.  Since they bailed on their own contract, all I want is a refund of the initiation fee, and a refund of the last 39 days I'd prepaid upon signing up back in December.  They've decided to ignore that request.  The excuses they've given me on the phone are piss-poor, and one member of their staff even got verbally abusive on the phone.  \n\nI highly recommend you check out the neighborhood message board, northernliberties.org, before considering a membership here.  I'm not the only one to complain (just the first one on Yelp, for some reason).  Here's one recent thread in particular: http://pub50.bravenet.com/forum/4226496069/show/637106\n\nIf City Fitness does the right thing and refunds my money (and reconsiders cheating its members in this manner) I would update my rating to 3 stars.  There are a lot of excellent things about this gym, and there are a lot of things that leave a foul taste in your mouth.  Here's the short list: \n\nThe good: \n- Many of the yoga teachers, including Lisa, Kelly and Mark, are fabulous and I miss them.  \n- The TVs & vents atop each aerobic machine are nice \n- The overall gym vibe is nice, full of neighbors, not meatheady\n\nThe bad: \n- The gym has some cleanliness issues.  Yes it is new so it looks new, but get close up to a yoga mat: they don't get scrubbed down and you can smell an interesting, unique sweat bouquet on each one.  Dust bunnies float about like tumbleweed, too.  The bathrooms are often out of toilet paper and I used a shower once and told myself never again, ew.  A professional cleaning company really needs to be hired here.  \n- When machines break, they should be fixed promptly.  Some of the treadmills were very shaky.  Some of the TVs and air vents don't work. \n- The nickel-and-diming across the board is very annoying.  How about providing towels for the prices we are paying?  Or the full shampoo/soap/conditioner range in the showers?  And the website still says a juice bar is \"coming soon.\"  I was told it was \"coming soon\" in December and it's still not been worked on.  Oh, and the tanning bed costs extra?  They should clearly state what is covered in a membership before people sign up.  Because all things (that you don't know up front) considered, it's not that great a deal. \n\nSigh.  Now to find another yoga place.",

  "text": "It is getting even worse if that is possible. I have visited a few gyms over the past couple of months and comparing them with this gym, this gym is just so out of date. The lighting in the cardio room esp. near the treadmills is awful. The tvs on the treadmills are very old and some are very fuzzy due to the cable being split among them (Doubtful they are bluetooth compatible for headphones). The towels barely cover you so good luck walking from the shower half naked (I'm on the smaller side too so I can only imagine how it is for taller or larger people). The rowing machines are outdated (even compared to a much cheaper gym I recently tried). As another poster mentioned the weekend hours are limited and the last time I was in there on a weekend night, both the trash near the water cooler on the cardio floor and the trash under the machine wipes were overflowing. The whole outdated equipment (that occasionally breaks) along with the abysmal lighting, cheap shower products and towels and overflowing trash just depresses me. I'm hoping another gym comes in soon and gives them some real competition or that someone shakes management out of their detrimental complacency. For the price we members pay, we truly deserve better.",

  "text": "This place is great! I've been a member of at least 10 gyms in my lifetime so I know a great gym when I see one. (T. Jimenez) The sales person I dealt with was very professional, well knowledged, outgoing and friendly. He gave me a quick tour of the gym, introduced me to the GM (Stuart I believe) who was also very nice and outgoing. I got a full explanation of the charges including the annual fee that someone in another yelp review mentioned they weren't told about. The sales team had great energy and I knew this was a place I wanted to workout at. The machines are all new and up to date. They have a good sized floor plan. Dumbbells up to 100lbs, Locker rooms have saunas, I saw a dance/studio class room. There was a cross fit section, a trx section, punching bag section, and also a cycling classroom. They offer daycare for not much more. I pay $32/month after taxes which isn't bad for the area and what they have to offer. They also have a towel policy. You must workout with a small towel to wipe up your sweat off of the equipment. Came here around 5p-7p weekday and the place wasn't that packed like you think it would be which is great.",

  "text": "I can't believe this place packs so many hidden fees into a gym membership for what is essentially a no-frills facility.  $199 signup fee AND a $40 annual \"maintenance\" fee per person on top of the monthly membership, which is only $10 a month if you want limited access and essentially don't want to use half of the facilities, otherwise you're coughing up $20 a month for a real connection.  The signup process simply baffles me.  When I showed up with my husband to check the place out--fully intending to get a membership--we were left waiting for over 20 minutes while the sales guy jaw jacked with a girl he obviously knew who was not signing up for a membership.  Then he sits us down and basically lays it out like \"it is what it is, take it or leave it\".  He said it was month to month; they advertise month-to-month; but I'm reading a lot of reviews about major problems with cancellation and managers ignoring complaints.  \nOh, and the pool is closed.\nConsidering the HUGE number of equally frightening broken equipment and other nightmare experience reviews that are huge red flags I think I'll pass, and recommend others do the same.",

For some reason when I looked at this place using Google Street View it appeared small to me.  I was quite surprised to see how large it was once I arrived.  The members door is actually behind the building.  The guest door on the side of the building indicates that, which I have a new appreciation for after recently visiting another location where I couldn't initially find the member's door.  Once you enter the member's door there are lockers where you can store your things.  There's a medium-sized room for classes.  To be honest it seemed a little small for a facility this large, but it was nice to see that they had at least eight spinning cycles that could be put into the room for spinning classes.  There was literally a wall of treadmills available.  I counted at least ten of them.  There was another wall of cycling machines with digital displays.  There were three smith machines and two power racks.  All of the equipment appeared to be StarTrac.  My favorite machines are the plate-loaded ones and this one had so many of them to choose from: chest press, shoulder press, incline press, lat pulldown, and one for seated rows.  When I left I was able to buy some Muscle Milk with my credit card, something else I am acquiring an appreciation for since the existence of credit card readers seem to be hit or miss at Anytime Fitness locations.  There is a banner on the wall stating that this is one of the fastest growing Anytime Fitness locations in the world.  With the size and selection available here I can believe it.",

  "text": "OK so I transferred from va to Florida and this location is the closest one to my house here in Florida. When I first walked in I was greeted by Preston who was very helpful . First impressions : it was small compared to the planet fitness I went. Equipment was older. One stand up tanning bed and one lay down tanning bed (not enough). No filtered water to refill your water bottles ( which my planet fitness had) The music was super low. the TVs were old and some were not working at all.  The locker room sinks definitely need replacing, they look dirty even though they are clean.  Everything in general just needs replacing... Old and dated. Overall  still a good place to work out... I'll go there for now bc it is close to my house. But I was told this location is getting an over haul in The summer ( of 2016)! So I'm super excited for that. I'm a black card member (20 bucks a month) for over a year now! And I've been more then thrilled with the facilities in Virginia. So  I'll be even happier to see new equipment, filtered water and new locker rooms... At this location...it should be the standard !But Preston your awesome keep up the good work!",

Once you get into the gym, you'll see very high ceilings and brand new equipment. The other important detail is there is no parking lot. There is street parking in the area though.\n\nI mostly have used the spin room. The spin classes are the same quality as the Northern Liberties location. I like these bikes a lot more than NL though. These bikes have a screen that shows you how long you were working, rpms, and calories burned. It's a feature that I really miss at NL. \n\nFor $50 and a $30 yearly fee I get access to all the gym locations within the city and all classes offered are included.

  "text": "So glad that Planet Fitness has finally come to Tucson! I had been a member since I was in high school living in New Hampshire and as a Black Card member ($19.99/month) I was able to keep my Planet Fitness membership when I went to college in Orlando, FL. When I moved to Tucson, I checked out other gyms but nothing compared to Planet Fitness. At other gyms in town I found the equipment to be old, staff was unfriendly, and they did not offer 24/7 hours like all PF's do. \n\nThe Oro Valley Planet Fitness is gorgeous with brand new equipment, a comfortable atmosphere, friendly, well-tranined staff who can answer questions about equipement, ect, clean locker rooms, free personal training sessions and additional amenities offered with the black card such as tanning, hydromassage and Red Light therapy. It is also very maintaned - you will always see a staff member walking around cleaning machines and there are cleaning stations throughout the gym encouraging members to clean their machines after using them. \n\nIf you are a \"no frills\" type of gym goer and just want access to the fitness equipment they also offer a $10/month membership. \n\nI prefer the black card since I can also use the 2nd location that just opened up by the Tucson Mall (big purple and yellow building you can't miss). Living in Marana, the Oro Valley location is convenient on weekends, especially since it's right next to Starbucks, Target and Frys which I frequent every Saturday but Tucson Mall is closer to where I work so it's great being able to access both and being able to use the clubs in NH when I go home to visit. I think they have clubs in almost all 50 states now so you will likely find one wherever you travel. \n\nExcited to be a member of PF again! And, as Micah P. said - they have a Big Ass Fan - which definitely makes it worth checking out!",

Also, I wanted to put my training on hold at one point and was given incorrect information over the phone that upset me greatly until I got it cleared up with someone else. \n \nI found out 3 months after signing up (through my bank statement) that I have a $29.99 annual fee that was not made clear to me at the beginning. I think the people who sign you up should be obligated to make that clear...not have you read through fine print after receiving a seemingly random charge to your credit card.\n\nThe gym is nice and I enjoy working out here (it is clean, the staff is pretty friendly and it's not too crazy busy when I work out) - but I could do without the issues above. Just some plain honesty and better communication could have made this 3 star review a 5.",

I love gymming for an affordable price but I will go out of my way to avoid the lack of service from the personnel assigned to this location. This place is horribly staffed and managed and offer little to no customer service or recovery for mistakes that are their own. They do not listen to customers and offer weirdly off-balance math. Beware of hidden fees and little to no accountability for clerical errors on their side. Any place that intends to keep such imbeciles on staff deserves no customer base. Do yourself a favor and find a gym that inspires rather than one that blindly robs and refuses to refund collected dues that were charged in error.",

The gym is overcrowded, dirty, and has aging equipment. \n\nIt is almost impossible to workout in the evening on a weekday. The locker rooms and showers are gross, the shower curtains are moldy and paper towels are in short supply. The equipment is getting old. The stretching mats are the same from 4 years ago, and quite nasty. They have continued to remove equipment from the general area and store it in the personal training area, making customized workouts difficult. \n\nThe few upsides are real racks - squat racks, incline/decline/flat benches, and everything else for Olympic lifts - and being open 24 hours.",

The location itself is expansive and clean for the most part. The bathroom area leaves a bit to be desired but other than that, all good. \n\nThe staff here are OK as well, I haven't had much interaction with them beyond the general check-in and approaching them for the massage chair coins and whatnot. Speaking of massage chairs, you gotta give those things a try...just wipe it down before you sit. I personally enjoy the chairs over the hydro massage beds. \n\nLastly,  I did notice the staff always makes sure to say bye & have a nice day/night to you when you walk out the door, which is a pretty nice gesture in my book!",

You will be sore forevaaa. \n\nI used to think rowing was all about those sexy backs *Que the JT* Nope, it'll work out your abs like no other and if you have proper form (which takes 5+ seshes to develop) an amazing leg workout. \n\nAll the instructors do variations of on the erg, off the erg doing an ab/leg/arm workout. I love that we alternate so that the 45min zooms by like everyone said. You're never on the erg for more than 7min I'd say. \n\nMy favorite part: Not pretentious. The other studios in CC have this feel to them. That $200 Lululemon yoga pant, judging you so hard for not being on a all juice cleanse, feel. These instructors helped you with your form and pushed you in a great way. Everyone was just trying to get a workout in and figure it out! \n\nMy least favorite part: The music suckss. It's kinda random like whatever happens to be playing on an old radio station? Nothing Top 40. Nothing hype. While I did get a great quick workout in, I never felt hype like LET'S DO THISSS when I walked into the studio or even during the workout. Def my biggest recommendation here,",

  "text": "First let me say that I was thrilled to join Crunch Gym, something close, local and affordable. My first encounter with having a problem was when my credit card information was stolen and had to close my credit card and I explained this to abc financial and the Crunch gym, that I would give them my new card information as soon as I received a new card. Every day that I had to check in for a class, they informed me I was behind on my payment (25.00!!) at the front desk in front of customers. Mind you they already had me account flagged in their computer and they said they would refrain from asking me anything until I received my new card. This happened every single time I went. My next issue with them was when I had to stop attending the gym because my daughter was unexpectedly deployed and now I was the primary care giver for my 3 year old grandson. I could not attend the gym due to my commute to work in New Brunswick every day and now the added responsibility of providing care to my grandson by taking him to and from daycare. I called several times and explained this to Crunch and their main concern was just getting money and not the concern that I had to raise a 3 year old until my daughter returns from duty in November. Then I could not due anything over the phone I had to physically come into the gym, which I had no time to do, or send a certified letter. While I was deciding to do this I was being charged from January up until June. I finally was able to take a day off from work with no pay and go into the gym and cancel my membership. Before I went to the gym to cancel I paid close to 160.00 (for a membership I didn't get to use), to make good on my contract with the gym. When the manager was about to process my termination papers, she had the audacity to ask my why I was canceling... I explained to her my situation, then she had the nerve to say that I had to pay an additional $25.00 for the month of July because in another 10 days I would be billed again! I will never and I mean never obtain another Crunch membership again under any circumstances! The manager was very rude, lacked compassion and basically made it seem like somehow I had the problem. I  am very disappointed with this money hungry gym and their lack of compassion that they distribute to people and their family members that are affected by individuals who are serving our country. My daughter's deployment was not planned, me being an alternative full time parent until my daughter returns, was not planned.....Crunch Fitness needs to be ashamed of themselves and how they treat their customers and households who are affected by family members serving our country. I plan on joining another gym that treats their members with respect, dignity and compassion and just doesn't look at their customers to meet their financial quota.",

I literally get lost in the music and the ride. Before I know it the class is over. I truly love it here and can't imagine ever leaving.  You may sign up for your classes in advance online and choose your bike. This is so nice.  What is even nicer is they provide towels at no cost, have water available for purchase, have two bathrooms which are kept immaculate, offer free ear-plugs and hair ties. They allow you to cancel a class up to an hour before start time. Other studios require 24 hours or more. My schedule can change in a blink of an eye so I like the fact that Soho Cycling realizes this about people and gives you the option to cancel at the last minute without being charged. It is a very upscale studio. They are active in the community. It is great to see a successful business give back to its city.  They also  give back to their customers by hosting social gatherings on a regular basis, after class, at near by establishments.  Once you experience what they have to offer you'll be hooked.

I was a member of this gym several years ago after purchasing a Groupon for a Boot Camp class, then I purchased a membership for a few months.

I prefer group classes, and I am pleased that they have added new classes since the last time I was a member.  They have a nice variety of classes, with a variety of teachers.\n\nMy husband is definitely bummed that they just removed the driving range, but we've heard rumors that they may add a golf component back in, which would be nice for the golfers.

  "text": "Fun variety of classes makes this not your average gym.\n\nThis is honestly the only no frills gym I will ever go to.  Classes are often late, AC breaks, check in line can be long, but all that adds to the character of this place.  This annoyed the type A person in me, but I also forgave it enough to go here for a year.  That shows you that the good definitely outweighed the bad.\n\nThe best part of this place is the classes.  You won't find them anywhere else.  I've taken booty jam, step class, pole dancing, zumba, pound, body pump, and I've enjoyed them all.  This is a great beginner gym for people.  There really isn't any real high intensity classes and people take things at their own speed.  You will never feel intimidated by the people who work out here.  Definitely no lululemon.  But that's ok, this gym doesn't try to be something it isn't.\n\nI'm sad that body pump is gone, because it was seriously the best!  In the end the distance got to me, but I would definitely suggest booty jam to anyone looking to have a good time.",

  "text": "I've been quite disappointed with this gym recently, which seems to correlate to management changing.\n\nThe fan in the room with the exercise classes has been broken for over a month, and has yet to be replaced.  Several people have reported this to the manager on a weekly, and even daily, basis, and he has neglected to follow up on this.  It's a $20 fan, just replace it.\n\nClasses have been cancelled last minute.  Last week, even the sub who was supposed to replace the original instructor cancelled the class.  Another thing that I think is poorly planned is the timing of the classes.  On Saturday, there are 3 classes in the morning, PiYo from 9-10 AM, Zumba from 10-11 AM, and Bootcamp that starts at 11:30 AM.  Then there are no classes for the rest of the day.  On Sunday there is only Zumba at 10 AM, and nothing for the rest of the day.  Also, there are literally no morning classes during the week, which is not typical of most gyms.\n\nIf you look at the new schedule, most of the classes are Zumba.  Don't get me wrong, Zumba is fun, but there are more classes they should seek out besides Zumba if they want to keep their members happy and well-rounded.",

  "text": "10 toes and 10 fingers up! Awesome studio! I honestly have never felt this strong and have so much energy now. I take 5-6 classes a week and did the black membership. Expensive but over the years, it will keep me healthier over time and be less expensive later. I am soooo out of shape, and a Christian, with pretty painful carpal tunnel and plantar fasciitis. I googled cure for CT and yoga was first and then the other two not proven to help was chiropractic care and surgery. I've been in classes for three months and outside of a much more feminine shape that happened, my arms are better and my feet feel pretty great. Not cured but way more manageable and only due to the stretching in class. It's not a studio that focuses on the spiritual side too much and when they do, I turn my gaze to my Creator instead of any yoga references for \"inner strength.\" So christians can feel comfortable here as well as very out of shape peeps. The instructors are so sweet and yes, sometimes it's not completely aired out or perfectly spotlessly wiped down but the people that are working out here come in clean. It's sweaty. It's not ballet class. But there are tea tree and water squirt bottles in case the floor around you needs a little care. I don't mind helping out. I highly recommend this studio!",

  "text": "After being a member at LA Fitness Signature for almost a year and a half I decided to cancel my membership. Initially, this gym was great, but this gym has multiple issues.\n\nOVERCROWDED\nAs more members have joined this gym and the gym is reaching full capacity LA Fitness has become too crowded. Between peak hours 5 to 7pm Mondays thru Fridays it is nearly impossible to get a parking spot. Once you find parking there is usually a wait for cardio and weight equipment.\n\nCLASS SCHEDULE\nThe class schedule doesn't change often so the class times either work for you or they don't. In my case, they did not. I wanted to take cycle classes, but they were always at 5:30pm or 7pm. I would have also liked to seen more of  a variety of classes offered.\n\nCLEANLINESS \nThere is always a film of dust and dirt on the cup holders and television screens of the ellipticals and treadmills as well as the fans on the treadmills. It doesn't help that the South Tampa members feel too entitled to wipe down the machines after using them. \n\nTOWELS (or lack of)\nIf you work out during peak hours it is not uncommon for the gym to run out of towels. For $50/month you would think LA Fitness could afford to buy more towels. If the members aren't returning the towels my suggestion is to have members trade their keys or ID for a towel. When members return their towel they get their keys or ID back. \n\nDESIGN\nWhile the floor to ceiling glass windows look attractive from the outside these windows cause several issues in the club. The cardio floor is miserable during the day because the sun is shining on the treadmills and ellipticals. The glare of the sunlight also makes it difficult to see the television sets on the cardio equipment. The windows also provide no privacy so everyone on Dale Mabry can watch you work out and those walking by the pool/hot tub area can see everything.\n\nWhile I still believe LA Fitness is one of the better gym options in Tampa this \"Signature Club\" did not meet my expectations.",

  "text": "I love City Fitness Grad Hospital! I first joined CF about three years ago at East Market as a founding member. Since then, I've been to multiple locations and tried an assortment of their programs. Overall, I have had a really positive experience with the CF facilities and their staff members and I have really appreciated their COVID response. \n\nWhile I have not done Thrive training at Grad Hospital, I was a thrive member at East Market. The program is great if you need more motivation or help with ideas for your workouts, but it isn't cheap. It's only semi-private training so it's likely there will be other people in your classes. A lot of people become friends through the program, so if you're new to the city it's a great way to meet people!\n\nI primarily use my CF membership to attend classes. You sign up for them through their app, and each class registration opens 25 hours before the class start time. Some classes fill quickly, so I have alarms set to remind myself to sign up for BodyPump. The regularly weekday BodyPump trainer Michelle is a great trainer, but she's very tough so be ready to work! Carrie does a BodyPump express on Friday mornings and that's one of my favorites. Ted's Saturday morning class is another favorite of mine, he offers a lot of modifications and is very open to feedback and requests. Beyond BodyPump, there are so many awesome Yoga instructors at CF. The Yoga studio is downstairs and there are cubbies across the hall so you can leave your items. I'm also a fan of the Phit Body classes. They aren't easy, but they combine cardio and strength for a great full body workout. \n\nThe facilities are always very clean and well maintained. The only time I've seen \"out of order\" signs on equipment has been for social distancing purposes. The women's locker room is downstairs and nice too! Quite a few showers and lots of lockers. It's not as big as the locker rooms at other CF facilities so I could imagine it would be tricky to get a locker when the gym is busier. \n\nThere are always clean towels and plenty of wipes for cleaning equipment. This location also has a nice smoothie bar and the hydro massage chairs. The staff is SO friendly! I often pass employees in the neighborhood (outside of the gym) and they still say hello! It's nice to feel so welcome at the gym because I am easily discouraged from working out. \n\nIf you're considering CF, I would absolutely recommend you check them out!",

He is super flexible with scheduling which was super helpful with my busy and sometimes unpredictable schedule. He was also always great about tailoring my workouts to my own individual needs and limitations. He also constantly sent me new workouts to do on my own via the special app that PTT uses to communicate with clients. \n\nOverall, two thumbs up for philly personal training and Matt!

Pilates powerhouse is owned by Camille. There are two other instructors, Brittany and Chris. All provide private lessons but there are some group lessons available which is what I do. There are hardly ever more than two people in a reformer class which allows for maximum teacher attention. The instructors are very knowledgable, personable, and attentive. They remember your needs (bad wrists, bad knees) and will provide you with modifications when needed. \n\nPro Tip: it's in a non-descript building. \nYou MUST call ahead to sign up for classes. \nIf you've never taken Pilates with reformer before you will have to take a couple privates.\n\nCons: limited class times - so build it into your schedule unless you do privates!",

They said that I needed to be present to sign a cancellation form.  \n\nWhen I got there, they started questioning if I actually wanted to cancel.

Nevertheless I was subjected to being told that for my own good I ought to think about not canceling.  \n\nEventually I was able to fill out the forms and signed them. I was then explained that there was a 30 day notice requirement, so my cancellation would not take effect for one account next month, the other account the following month.\n\nSo they got me for an extra couple hundred dollars.\n\nI feel that two stars is fair because the fitness is very good and accordingly expensive, but their business practices are not something I would in good conscience recommend anyone sign up for.

  "text": "My husband and I joined LifeTime shortly after it opened. At first it was great, SUPER clean, equipment always in working condition and overall great. I personally love the outdoor pool, and i appreciate that you can't bring guests in on the weekends. It makes it so it's never too crowded. Unfortunately, we've been pretty disappointed the last few weeks. The locker rooms are starting to be absolutely disgusting. Last time I used the steam room there was a hair ball with a clothing tag tangled in the middle of it, I went back TWO days later and it was still there. The shower cleanliness has also gone down hill. Last summer there was an attendant pretty much always in the locker rooms, wiping down showers, sweeping the excess water on the floors, now you are lucky if the towels are stocked. I would expect this from a LA fitness where you pay $30 a person but to be paying $100 for the first person and $60 for the second this is unacceptable.\nCleanliness aside, the price they charge for infants is outrageous. DO NOT join this gym if you have a child that isn't walking. The infant room, although the staff is great, is such a rip off. You have to arrange in advance (at least 24 hours!) which if you have babies, is next to impossible. They make you pay $40/kid/month yet they tell YOU when you can bring your baby. If this is the case, infants should be discounted. After the summer we'll be looking elsewhere, only good thing about this place is the outdoor pool.\nLastly-beware of using your membership card at the cafe. They always double charge. The cafe staff don't care, and just give you something free when you tell them. We've been double charged for coffee 4 times in the last month. I'm not sure if it's a human error or system error but regardless make sure to check your statement.",

Like most Ys, they have several classes that members can attend at various hours throughout the day. I've been to several cycling classes as well as Les Mills Bodypump. The instructors for all have been great and I always feel like I get a good workout. The only negative I have is that some of the free weights/racks as well as the locker room is a little dated (everything is still in good shape though!).",

  "text": "As a passport member for Crunch, I have been to many locations in the Tampa area and nationally. When it comes to the Tampa Bay area, I'd say this location is my third favorite (behind Amberly and Downtown Tampa). \n\nThe cardio deck is separated upstairs which is nice since it's separated from the weights and keeps that area less congested. I like how the gym has a wide layout. It doesn't have the amount of equipement that some of the other locations have but it works with the way it's laid out. \n\nThe only con for me is that the dumbbell/free weight area is a little congested due to the small area it's in. Other than that it's hard to beat what the gym has for the price. \n\nBonus: It has a sauna!",

It's like they've never heard of vacuum attachments- there are huge dust bunnies and clumps of hair behind trash cans and under many pieces of equipment. Paper towel dispensers are routinely empty, so you can't wipe down equipment. You can ask the employees to refill the machines, but in my experience, they say \"thanks!\" and ignore the request. Don't look along the walls or in the bathrooms because it's bad there, too.  I imagine it's a steady cash cow for the owner so he/she doesn't care.",

You'll find a basketball court, bungee jumping set up, arcade games, mini soccer field, etc. etc. For the adults you'll find a beer and wine bar and a junk food eats like pizza and chicken wings. I was able to check out the Incrediplex with my husband's company for their annual holiday party. This was an ideal location for adults to do their thing while the kids could hop from activity to activity with a buffet bar of food available for all. The location is a bit odd but features plenty of parking. \n\nMy only complaint from the visit was the super grumpy bartender who visibly hated his job. Luckily, this can easily be improved.",

  "text": "I had a membership with Bally Total Fitness and went to the location on Grant and Swan.  At the beginning of this year, LA Fitness took over this Bally's location.  I went in and switched my membership over... pretty easy.  Then, this location closed.  I was told I could choose one location in town as my home gym as it was not my fault the Grant and Swan location closed.  I chose this location and did like it, however, it was about 2 miles farther then the Grant and Swan one.  Everytime I would come here after work or on the weekend I would have to wait for a machine.  This location is a meat market and all you will see is college kids.  I chose to cancel my membership and go somewhere else.  This is where I became frustrated.  It is a pain in the ASS to cancel your membership.  I was given conflicting information from the general manager and several other employees on how to cancel my membership.  The general manager Ashley, I believe his name was, lied to me and told me I could cancel my account online.  I told him I had an account online and asked him to guide me through it.  All he did was take me in circles and waste my time.  He also stated I didn't have an online account, but I was online looking at everything he was.  I went online and read the policy which stated to send a cancel form by certified mail.  I am sure glad I did.  This is the only way you have proof that their Corporate office received your cancel form.  Otherwise, I think they just throw them in the trash.  After looking at several complaints online, I can see that I was not the only person to have this issue.  LA Fitness makes it as difficult as possible to cancel your membership, so once you are frustrated, you will just give up and think it's not worth the hassle.  Whatever you do, if you do wanna cancel, send your form certified.  I am SOOOO glad I am done with this place!",

We also have a membership that we use very often.\n\nThe YMCA is for all ages and though its mostly for family's there's still a lot of stuff to do. The YMCA is mostly known for its swimming pools, in total the YMCA has 3 pools, a slide, a spray park, a hot tub, and a little pool for younger children. However, that's not all the YMCA also provides a large gym, daycare, plenty of activities for all ages, and more. My brother plays basketball there, he has lots of fun and has made some friends. Personally, I like the e-gym, the e-gym is a portion of the gym that you just have to scan your wrist band then the weights and adjustments to the machine are set up for you. It's perfect for beginners! Also, I've had great experiences with people who work there, they are very nice and helpful.\n\n-SP",

Over two years later I start getting a call and an email saying I owe money on over due charges. What? That account is closed why do I owe money? So I  went down there. The kid \"helping\" me was no help and obviously was in no mood to help me deal with this issue. I told him I will not be paying the fee since I have not gone there in such a long time and the account should of been canceled a long time ago. \"well fees carry over\" yeah I get that, but over two years later? no I don't think so, its not my fault you guys didn't properly close my account when this all happened the first time. \"well just pay the fee and it all goes away\" obviously not cause this is the second time ive had to deal with this! he was so unhelpful with just saying the same thing over and over again. I get you're just doing your job. i work with people too but there has to be more that you can do when it comes to something like this.

  "text": "I'm a fairly new convert to American Iron, but, from what I've seen, it's one of the most unique and value-driven gyms in Reno. With accessible hours, abundant equipment and opportunities for personal training, American Iron has some great perks. \n\nFor potential members, be aware that this gym is pretty no-frills, but it does offer all of the most basic and advanced weightlifting equipment you'll ever need--including squat racks, free weights, kettle bells and more--as well as cardio machines. Among the patrons you'll find professional bodybuilders, exercise newbies, seniors and young people alike. \n\nWhen I first joined, I paid extra to work with one of the on-staff licensed personal trainers, Kindra Cannon, and I can't recommend her enough. She taught me how to use machines I'd never worked with before, and she gave me plenty of encouragement throughout the process (and tough love, when I needed it). She also offers meals plans as an add-on to her services.\n\nIf you're just looking for a basic membership, this gym offers the most bang for your buck that I've seen in Reno, at around $30 per month (less if you buy several months or a year at a time).\n\nThings to consider: \n\n-The music appears to be a looping playlist of the same 20 metal, alternative and heavy rock songs (I'm pretty sure I've heard Papa Roach's \"Last Resort\" at least four dozen times since I became a member). If that kind of music isn't your jam, be sure to download Spotify or Pandora and listen to your own music on your smartphone. The wi-fi is free for members!\n\n-This gym can be intimidating, especially for women and/or beginners, who seem to be in the minority. Since the gym can get pretty busy during peak hours, other members will ask to work in with your equipment or swoop in on your machines while you're doing a circuit, so make sure you're willing to speak up if you need to. But many of the members are also experienced gym rats, so if you're willing to accommodate others and follow proper gym etiquette then you'll be treated well. The women who *do* go to American Iron are total badasses, by-and-large, so the atmosphere can be quite motivating if you give it a chance.\n\n-The location, on Rock Blvd on the east side of the airport, is off the beaten path for many Renoites, so take this into consideration if a close proximity to the gym is important to you.",

The equipment always works and if something does goes off it is tended to in a timely fashion. The hours are very convenient.

They have a wide variety of options at various times. The club is always very clean.

Bloomberg, Fox Business) to the television lineup, that would be great.. pretty please thanks",

  "text": "Another indoor cycling studio brand has arrived! I was fortunate enough to be able to try the free classes during their opening week and overall, it was a decent class.  The structure is very similar to Flywheel, which I used to go to quite frequently.  You ride on the bike and do some arm work with some weights during your class as well.\n\nOverall, I had a really good and challenging workout. I'm a distance runner and cycling was still pretty hard and challenging for me.  My only criticism is I know it's impossible to pay attention to everyone's form but it's SO important for instructors to walk around and look at everyone at some point.  You can get knee injuries if you aren't cycling correctly or are pushing too hard.  Classes are pretty pricey and since I run 4-5x a week for marathon training, I don't think I could afford a membership here at this time, but maybe in the future. I just wouldn't use it enough right now to justify the cost.\n\nIf you're into cycling though, check this place out!  It's new and clean, they offer free snacks and have water there as well.  They provide the cycling shoes included in the price of your class which is also great.  All the employees were very nice and excited to be there!",

  "text": "For many years I have loved Powerhouse.  That is until I found out they lied to their customers about paying their prior rent that our monthly fees were going toward.  They stated they were closing the location due to rent increases but that they were all caught up and it was a price increase.  The financial report the next day suggested they hadn't been paying for a year. So they have forced all of the customers to their new location where rent is cheaper and the service sucks. They no longer have sweat towels and don't even try taking a shower- even though you will need to with the rush over traffic you experience at this new location.  If you shower not only will they not provide you any type of towel but there is no soap and shampoo in the dispensers.  Additionally, when you go to wipe your machine down they are ALWAYS out of wipes, it's disgusting! Are they really trying to cut back this much or just lazy? I'd like to say this stemmed after one day but it has been EVERY visit here. It's frustrating, it's a simple convenience that you guarantee the supply of for sanitary purposes.  Lastly I showered with paper towels last week but was unable to this week because they were \"out\".  This gym has probably lost half of its customers due to being unethical and unsanitary and is becoming a royal pain in the butt.  I can't wait for someone to open a gym where they actually care and value their customers. The only reason I recommend going here is because the equipment is great.",

Don't let them tell you otherwise.\n\n2) Shower and change at home. The shower and changing rooms are unsanitary and people shave in the sink. Even wash their feet. Yuck.\n\n3) Avoid peak times, the gym gets busy and especially in the free weight areas where people don't put equipment away. 6am and 3pm are good times during the week.\n\n4) Classes are free and some e.g. Spinning, are really good. Jen, in particular, is awesome.\n\n5) The gym was refurbished at the end of 2012 and is in decent shape.\n\n6) Yes, there really is a big TV and couch in the stinky changing room.\n\nA lot of the reviewers here have fair comments, but they forget it is the gym members that make it smell and don't put equipment away!\n\nAs for me, I follow the above and I'm kind of happy here. The only thing I don't get is why the management don't read these comments and do something about it?",

  "text": "For a field trip, I brought kids I was supervising at a summer camp to Playformance for an afternoon. I did not know what to expect as I only knew as much about Playformance as what I was told over the phone. My first impression was that the building itself is pretty old (there's a good reason why) and that I was worried for my kids. Thankfully, I stuck with the \"you never judge a book by its cover\" principle.\n\nOnce the kids and I entered, we were greeted right away by the staff. At that moment their kids were in \"free time\", where they were either playing Gaga, soccer, an obstacle course, or rock climbing. My kids immediately joined them for the fun. Next, the staff led all the kids in team-building games built around their philosophy (you can find it on their website). After a fun game of Box Ball, they ended the day with a compliment circle. \n\nI was very impressed and satisfied with this place. They have a mission of providing a fun and safe environment were kids of all ages are learning the values of teamwork and lifelong success. They are promoting strong physical education and healthy eating habits (the lunches they offer meet children's nutritional guidelines). The reason for the building being old is that the place they use to be located at was damaged due to arson. They were offered this place and turned it around to a great place for kids. The staff was very friendly to the kids and all seem committed to giving them a great time. Most importantly, they are  making these kids into leaders, whether it is on the field, in the classroom, or in their communities. \n\nIf you are in the downtown area or near their location, I strongly recommend sending your kids here.",

How many times I found band-aids drifting in the swimming pool? A lot. How many times I noticed sand and plastic cup lids on the bottom? Too many. How many times I was filling in the form on their website to tell them about it? Three, to be honest. How many times anybody contacted me to say they're to fix the problem? None. The last straw here is the Escape bar. Stuff is great - they are quick, polite and helpful. The problem is in food. It's ridiculously expensive and absolutely wretched. I have tried salads, flatbreads, steaks and burgers there so I know what I'm talking about. They are really proud of their new chef but I'm not sure they have to be proud of their food, really. I had a flat steak a month ago and I ended up with terrible heartburn at the time. Some time later we were too lazy to cook dinner at home so we decided to try a couple of burgers here. I thought \"nobody can ruin the burger\" and I decided to give it a try (we both had their special \"The Big NAC\" burger). That evening I was suffering a heartburn again and I promised myself never ever in my life eat here. It's just not worth it! I can spend my $30 for a better dinner in a better place.",

  "text": "Going from a private workout club to a multiple location establishment, we knew was going to take some getting use to however first impressions are important and this location did not give off a great one.\n\nThis is the closest location that has spinning so on the day I wanted to try it, I showed up 15-20 min before the start, and was very rudely informed that we have to sign up a week in advance (in person) and I was put on the wait list and I had to come back to the desk at the start of the class to see if I could get in.  I was not informed of this when we originally signed up for the membership so as I tried to ask more for the future, another guest comes to the desk and the lady very rudely stops our conversation and decides to take care of the other guest.  I went about a workout, then came up to the desk to sign up for the next time I'd be able to come to spinning.\n\nI showed up for the 2nd class with my husband who had also signed up, and the lady gives us a pass to go into the room.  Once in there, there was only 1 open bike, 3-4 broken bikes and the instructor asked to see passes and the lady who was checking people in was giving the wait list people the pass for the people who were \"guaranteed\" a spot so our spots were already taken.  I went back up to the check in lady, and while trying to figure out what happened this time with it all, she decides to stop our conversation rudely in the middle by answering the phone when there were 3 others around that could have answered.\n\nThat was my last straw and I asked to speak with the manager.  He did listen to our concerns and chalked it up to new employees and the month of January but with my job I deal with people on a daily basis and new or not, there should always be a common courtesy given to each and every person encountered.  I hope that this situation is used as a learning experience for the 2 girls above.\n\nOn our 3rd attempt we were able to finally participate in spinning and loved every minute of it.  I noticed a sign that said their earliest class at 530am was first come, first serve - I suggest that each class be like that to give everyone a fair advantage, especially people who can't get in to sign up in person, or at least allow sign ups over the telephone.",

Right now the first floor is freezing and the second floor is 70-76 degrees...which is where all the cardio equipment.  This is terrible for someone like me with asthma.  After complaining a bunch of times, I found out the salon controls the heat and I can't blame the patrons for wanting it warm...it just sucks when you are there to work out; a lot of the machines aren't maintained--treadmills not balanced like the other review said and some of the machines will shut down when you're on them, etc. but for the most part the equipment is way better than other gyms.  \n\nIf they could fix the temperature control issues in the locker room and second floor and enlarge the ladies' locker room, it would be perfect.  \n\nThe price seems to be reasonable for the quality of equipment and professional of staff/operation/cleanliness, etc.",

Leta, the instructor, is fun and very lively like all Zumba instructors I know! As with anything, it takes a few classes to get used to the moves. But it's fun learning! It's probably even more fun watching us trying! Lol. Class schedules are available online or at the facility if you're interested. Other classes are offered as well. (Spin & cross-fit)  Once in a while they offer quick workshops on the equipment they have on hand and how to use them...pretty cool & informative!\n\nMembership is fairly cheap as well. Check your health insurance at work. I have UnitedHealthcare, and LA Fitness is one of their health & wellness partners. I get a $10 fitness reimbursement for going to the gym at least 12 times every month! So going to the gym is even sweeter!  \n\nAll in all, I like coming here.

You get a sauna, steam room, pool, open group/circuit room that's available for personal use quite often, cardio, weights, TRX. But, the gym gives off a pretty filthy vibe. Nothing is new. The equipment is very outdated and you just get the sense that the equipment is grimey. It's very important to wash down all the equipment with the cleaning materials before use. I think you would be happy if you can look past feeling unclean when you work out here. \nIt's also not in the best of areas of Lebanon Pike. It has a pawn shop near it and sometimes you don't feel that safe walking to your car if it's at night. Take everything into consideration before you get membership.",

Great location- parking is so easy and the atmosphere is so light and easy to get in there and out and feel great about what I did.  They also top it off with clean towels and water.  Honestly, there is just a very nice aura and energy here that is inviting, safe, and professional!",

  "text": "ToneZone is probably my favorite place for fitness classes, ever.   I've been coming here about once a week since I started working down the street in Conshy about a year ago, and absolutely love it.\n\nAll of the classes I've been to and all of the instructors have been top-notch.  High energy, great workout, awesome music, and best of all fun.  My favorites are Wednesday/Friday Warrior, Boot Camp, and Cardio Kickboxing.  I'd say I'm in pretty good shape (I also rock climb, run, go to a regular gym)... and the classes still all kick my a$$.  However they're really designed for you to push yourself personally whatever fitness level you're currently at -- and there have been plenty of beginners, moms-to-be, people trying to get back into shape, etc. that attend classes and do really well.\n\nAs I mentioned, all of the instructors I've had have been awesome (Scott, Frank, Erika, Regina, Anne, ...).  They all seem really into it, have a lot of energy, and make sure you're really pushing yourself as best you can.  And they mix up the classes and exercises so even the \"same\" class is totally different week to week, which keeps it fun.  The playlists they use are also basically the best workout music ever -- great upbeat mixes of both current and classic pop songs, that also always change every class.\n\nToneZone is also extremely clean, has great new equipment, and is always a comfortable workout temperature with AC at high 60s (which is very important when it's over 90 out).  The Elm St. location is a little smaller than the newer one on Ridge, but still a great space.  I generally go to whichever one has a class I want to take at the time I'm looking for, on any given day.\n\nWoooo ToneZone!",

  "text": "No trial workout?!?! \n\nMy husband and I showed up ready to sign up with Planet Fitness yesterday. I'd done my research and we were pretty sure this was the gym for us, but we wanted to give it a try first. \n\nWhen we arrived, I was shocked to learn that the \"black card\" (Premier) membership requires a 12 month contracts - UGH - and there's a fee equivalent to 3 months dues if you break contract. Double ugh. Oh well, we could get the cheaper, basic membership on a month to month basis. Except..... \n\nThey refused to let us have a trial workout!! We were there ready to give this place a go, water bottles in hand, and she said it was \"a liability\". Well, apparently it's not a \"liability\" for every other gym you're competing with because they ALL offer a free trial - many give you a week or some even a month long pass. We just wanted ONE work out before signing up and they wouldn't do it. Our only option was to pay $20 for a drop in fee which would be credited towards our membership (if we signed up). So for more than the cost of an entire MONTH, we could work out ONCE - to *try* the gym. I don't think so. \n\nThankfully there are other gyms in the area that offer no contracts, tanning, equipment AND will let you spend 30 minutes on their equipment before you sign up. *SHEESH*",

The whole experience was great. When I walked in, they greeted me immediately and directed me to change into my robe and slippers. I waited in the relaxation room for a few minutes before my facialist (?) took me back. She was great. She asked me what I hoped to get out of it and if there was anything I'd like her to focus on. She spent the whole 50 minutes doing different scrubs, masks, and rubs- even massaging my shoulders, arms, and hands. If you're curious about the extraction part, it was a bit unpleasant, but my skin looks clear and feels great now! The whole experience was so relaxing. Can I have another next week please?",

  "text": "Ugh. This has been my go-to gym for the past few years, but only due to the convenience and relatively low price of $20 a month. The gym has recently gone through some significant changes in terms of management, and I can attest to some of the good changes and fixes they've employed, but the overall atmosphere and experience is seriously lacking.\n\nPositives - As I stated above, the price is good. That's one of the few redeeming qualities of the place -- honestly! Depending on the time, it's not overly-crowded (unless you're going at 5 pm sharp on a weekday) and the clientele is OK. Most people are focused on getting a good, quick workout, and people are relatively friendly (except that giant, douchey, stereotypical \"bro\" guy that always wears revealing tank tops and inappropriately tight pants. Regulars will know who I'm talking about) Additionally, I like that they've put in a few \"sanitary wipe\" stations with trash cans around the gym. In terms of essentials, retro does have a few benches, a squat rack, power cage, kettlebells, etc.\n\nNegatives - Since management has undergone changes, I've noticed several new faces behind the front desk, as well as new trainers and class instructors. Unfortunately, many of the front desk employees are too busy talking to friends or have their heads buried in their phones to even say 'Hello' or even acknowledge your presence. This even extends to the new manager who isn't very friendly, helpful or outgoing in the slightest; honestly, he seems very indifferent and appears like he couldn't care less.\n\nThe place is seriously dirty. I can't blame this all on the staff and management, though. Many of the clientele don't bother to wipe down the equipment and are too lazy to even put weights back where they belong. The clocks on the wall are ALWAYS incorrect, and no one seems to give a crap. The bathroom can also get very gross and smells awful.\n\nThis location is also in serious need of an equipment and free weight upgrade. The wear and tear on some of the machines is obvious, and it would be nice to have some different machines or other things to improve the experience. Speaking of experience, the \"class area\" is super small and about the size of my bedroom (not an exaggeration).\n\nLastly, the AC/Heating in this gym is all out of whack. This summer, the gym was consistently hot and pretty gross. I remember one particular week, the AC completely out of commission and the temperature inside the gym was 89 degrees!\n\nThis retro location is flawed in so many ways. If i had any better alternatives in the area, I would 100% pursue them and leave this place in the dust.",

I did a free trial membership, ended up joining, and wrote a 5/5 review regarding the my initial experience. Praised some of the staff there. Ended up deleting it because all that hype just disappeared within the next month but I will still say it's a good gym. (Why delete it? well it was just a little disappointing cause of a little let-down in that sense but oh well)\n\nAs an update, I have put my 30 days notice for canceling my membership. And the reason why I am canceling my membership is because i'm moving out of the city and won't be close at all to this gym. I will say, they must be reading the reviews and really listening to the complaints because I thought it was going to be a pain from all the previous reviews/complaints but it wasn't at all. I signed on a digital pad at the front desk, a copy of the cancellation was emailed to me and a follow-up email asking for some feedback was given. Easy as that. I will keep checking my bank statements to see if something terrible happens but honestly, it was simple!\n\nThey must be listening..... and I say this because even with the issues of there only being 1 squat rack, surely enough they ended up adding another.

  "text": "Have tried all the LA Fitness locations in Pinellas county and this one is the best....by far. Now it would be easy to say that because it's the newest but that's not the only reason. The location is super convenient to get to (right off 19). I really like the layout everything is right there not any multiple floors to climb to get to the free weights (like at the 4th st and Seminole locations). The locker room is kept clean which is important. The pool area is large with a big Jacuzzi. Most importantly there is more than one of the nautilus machines and plenty of free weight stations throughout so practically no waiting so ya gotta dig that. All in all, the best LA Fitness I've visited.",

  "text": "Wow. This rec center is amazing and definitely the best gym/rec center I have ever been to. It features a new multi-million dollar gym area, A huge swimming pool (heated) and lots of chairs for sun bathers. Approximately 8-10 racquetball courts, huge locker rooms for both genders, many dance rooms located upstairs and downstairs, and indoor track, sand volleyball, a pro shop, and 6 basketball courts (one of those can be converted into indoor soccer)! For some reason the tutoring center and a restaurant is here as well but I've never been to either of those places. \n\nThe new gym is definitely the highlight of this rec-center. It is 2 stories with hundreds of machines. The atmosphere is very nice, it is extremely clean, there is music playing, and there are a lot of TVs around to keep your eyes busy. So many TVs that in fact each treadmill, elliptical, and bicycle has its own LCD TV that you control yourself. The free weights area is pretty large and is clearly defined and upstairs has a lot of mats for floor exercises. You can check out medicine balls and exercise balls from the staff. With water fountains located conveniently throughout the entire rec center to keep you hydrated this place has everything! I highly doubt you can find a workout that is missing from this gym.\n\nParking is rarely an easy thing to do because the parking lots can get extremely full sometimes but the worst case scenario is that you park in the back of the lot.  \n\nAt the beginning of each semester when everyone is in \"workout\" mode there tends to be waits for various machines in the gym. Most notably the treadmills, elliptical machines, and sometimes the free weights area gets ridiculously packed. Also on extremely busy nights the basketball wait can take an extremely long time, I remember waiting almost an hour once to play 1 game. The reason for this is because various clubs and groups (karate, badminton, volleyball, etc) will rent out 1 or 2 of these courts which narrows down the 5 basketball courts that are used down to 3 and some nights I've seen it come down to 2. \n\nAnother downside is that the rec center is only available to students, alumni, faculty or guests of any of those people. So if you don't know a single University of Arizona person, it might be hard for you to get a membership here but if you do its definitely the best deal in town.  \n\nIn my opinion the best thing about the UA rec is the basketball scene there. It is definitely has the best pick up basketball in the State of Arizona. 5 courts are usually running full 5 on 5 games on weeknights and on weekends that number usually falls to about 3 or 4. Even then that is still a lot of chances for you to get a good game of basketball in. You don't have to bring your own basketballs either because you can check one out at the rec center. \n\nOverall, the UA rec is just plain amazing its hard to describe how large it actually is when you are inside of it and with so much to do you'll never get bored here. It has an awesome atmosphere with a great staff that is very helpful. I would highly recommend anyone get a membership here if possible, I promise you will never regret it!!\n\np.s. This place closes at midnight now, which compared to last year's 10pm close makes the rec center that much better.",

  "text": "Very good gym with a personalized, high-tech training vibe to the experience.  There is a range of activities, fun stuff for the kids (kid's club is phenomenal), yoga classes, fairly up to date exercise equipment, weights, etc.  They have some in-depth training programs, and seem to focus on a lot of sport science.  The lockers are adequate and have been updated from time to time.  \n\nThe staff is very pleasant, especially Joel who is the general manager.  He stands out.\n\nThat said, it's not quite a 5-star experience.  The cafe is very amateur, with mostly kids working, and chefs equivalent in training to what you'd expect in a local pub.  They sell a ton of greasy pizzas, cheese burgers, and hot dogs along with a decent attempt at healthier options.  I think they need a few more registers to move people along and some higher-end ingredients than the pre-packedged stuff.\n\nThe pool can become a bit crowded and overly zealous, but what can you expect from a communal pool?\n\nOverall the vibe is a good mix of fun with sport science, and they have a gigantic parking lot that still tends to fill up so it says something about the attractiveness of a membership there.",

But if there are two of them behind the front desk at any time, other than during one of their furtive lunch breaks, I must insist that one of them be vacuuming.  There is no excuse for these fallen standards at Fitness Factory, since its franchise opened in St. Louis, and no reason why I should have to pick up after other members.",

The equipment that is at the gym is usually set aside for the personal trainers (lighter weights etc).  The staff are not welcoming and actually are downright rude.  I was there 4+days per week for 2 years and never was treated as someone that they recognize, no smile, no hi.  \n\nThe gym is frequently very dirty.  Look at the ladies locker room.  The carpet?  Yuck! The pool gets green on a regular basis.  The shower room is also dirty.  \n\nWhen I cancelled (I was no longer in a contract) they charged me a $50 cancellation fee.  I was happy to pay it and no longer go to this dump.  \n\nBeware of their new $9.99 per month promotion.  With all of the fees it works out to $25 per month.\n\nThe owners were so cheap that when they changed their name to Fitness Connection they had housekeeping staff take black stickers and place them on top of the Gold's Gym stickers.  Well, they did not match up very well and you can clearly tell that it is still the Gold's logo. Ridiculous.  \n\nKIDS childcare area:  They have hungover looking college age girls working in the childcare.  They also have 1 staff person to 10 children.  This translates to 1 hungover looking college girl watching 10 babies/toddler in the morning since the older kids are in school.  Ummm no thanks. I elected to pay a professional to watch my baby rather than taking her to this gym childcare.  UNSAFE!\n\nSo, if you are looking for an unfriendly, dirty gym with TV's that are usually broken or hardly working this is the place for you.",

I love that you can plug in your smart phone directly to the equipment. \n\nMy only downside is they could not remodel some of the clientele. For example, there are people that crank out a lot of weight, I mean an impressive amount of weight, but for some reason they must exert all their energy in lifting the heaving weight and just don't have the strength to re-rack the weights. This is a huge pet-peeve of mine for a couple of reasons. \n\n1) why should somebody have to clean up after you?\n2) it is confusing to know if they're actually done with the equipment\n\n\nNext, WIPE DOWN THE EQUIPMENT WHEN YOU ARE DONE! Seriously, it's a gym and you sweat. We all sweat in there. In fact, that seems to be the number one side effect of going to the gym. It's not like anyone will catch MRSA from sweat, but it's just plain nasty.\n\nSeems a little petty to complain about these things, but when you are on a tight time schedule, i.e, your lunch break, time is of the utmost essence. In other words, most do not have time to workout and play housekeeper. \n\nThe staff is very helpful and friendly, I just wish for once that they would hold members accountable for their clear violation of gym etiquette.  \n\nAgain, I will reiterate, I have been a member forever, but I only go because of its proximity to my employer. \n\nIf any staff or management actually takes the time to read this, please have a little more pride in appearance and hold certain members accountable.

  "text": "Planet Fitness is the cheapest option I've seen in a gym, anywhere, ever, at around $15/month over a year.* Not only that, but the facilities are comparable to gyms I've seen that charge several times as much (and are more crowded).  The staff are pleasant, the equipment is in reasonable condition, and while maintenance was neglected for the first half of 2019, it's been good recently.  \n\nOne downside of this gym that I've run into is the undersized and often crowded free-weight area that's missing standard bench racks and the heavier weights of dumbbells.  It's rare for the gym to be too busy to find a bench, but it would be great if they expanded this area to match demand. The second downside is that this gym (needlessly) advertises falsely low rates. The prices are super good--around $15/month if you contract for a year, yet they advertise $10, then tack on a yearly fee. \n\nThis gym isn't \"perfect\", but as far as value goes, it would be tough to beat.  My gripes about deceptive pricing and occasional crowding aren't unique to Planet Fitness, and just mentioned for completeness sake.  You'd be hard pressed to find a better choice for staying fit around the area.",

  "text": "Management, can you address the first issue noted below?  Too many of the treadmills have problems for a member to take it upon himself to \"report\" each one, and since the machines have no numbers, it would be nearly impossible to do so!  \n\nI would give this gym a 5-star if they would address the fact that at least half of the treadmills have at least one thing wrong with them.  It's very counter-productive, during a workout, to get all set up on a machine, then discover that the tread is loose or the headphone feed to the TV is impaired.  (Often other users are on the okay-machines, so often there's a hunt for a passable one.) The fact that none of the treadmills seem to have numbers reinforces the impression that this Sweat branch has no interest in maintaining these machines to baseline level.  I.e., if members have no way to reference particular machines for repair, where is the mechanism for ensuring quality and fixing machines?  Please address this systemic problem!  You're better than this.\n\nAnother less pressing question: why do the tv's on all your machines get only about 7 channels: two 24-hour sports channels, CNN, Fox, and a couple other pretty bad ones?  Other gyms I've used before and during business travel typically have way more channels than this.  For the steep membership price, can't you do better for your members?\n\nI promise I will return and sing your praises--these are the only down's I've encountered--if you address these problems.\n\nSweat is a great gym otherwise.

  "text": "It's fine. There are generally enough treadmills/ellipticals so that you don't have to wait. You will wait for gear in the weight training station. What bothers me is the temperature inside. The building is old and clearly used to be an office building. It was never designed for or intended to house hundreds of sweaty people working out at the same time. As such, every year around April the AC system can't keep up and it gets hot as balls inside this gym. To the point where cardio is uncomfortable and if the sun has gone down, its actually cooler outside than in the facility. Along the same vein, because it was an office building, there is not nearly enough parking. If you come between 5-7pm you will see people parked along the street, along the median, circling the lot, doing basically anything they can to find parking. Hopefully someday LA can find a parcel big enough to relocate into a prototype gym. Until then, I'm on a cheap as hell family plan, so i keep going.",

I love their flow and I've been to quite a few hot yoga studios, CorePower by far, is my all time favorite. I'm beginning to think I cannot go on without it and am contemplating getting the online access to classes so I can practice while in school. Yoga Sculpt is my favorite class, and the hardest class available, with fusion of cardio, weights, and yoga flow. This is the get in shape class! My second fav is C2, good flow and next in line in the get in shape regimen. The teachers here are new, but, very good. Dylan is super intense during Sculpt but, pushes you appropriately. Mia, her second time teaching was a couple of days ago, and she is a rock star and provided a very calming, but powerful, flow for Hot Power Fusion! Congrats Mia! For new students, the first week is HELL (you will feel like you are dying), but, once you get over this hump, you are indefinitely hooked. The yoga high is real! Locker rooms are clean, studio is clean, I have zero complaints! I will definitely keep coming back to this location! Cheers!",

  "text": "First of all, I have to say that the gym itself is nothing special-- for the monthly fee that they charge, it should be exceptional compared to other area fitness centers. That is not the case.\n\nInitially, what first drew me to this gym were the classes, which (of course) you have to pay extra for. But I bit the bullet and signed up for that, because I really wanted a weekly class that I could go to. The zumba classes were great, but I went one night at a scheduled class time only to have somebody tell me (ten minutes after the class started) that the class was no longer at that time. By the way, if you went online to look at the schedule, it still said the class was held at the intended time.\n\nBut my real issue lies with the staff and the horrible way we were treated upon attempted cancellation. When we first joined, nobody reached out to us about taking a tour or how we were liking the gym or anything of that nature. Because we weren't in love and we were paying $30 a month, we decided to cancel. WELL, we were thrown back and forth between the gym and their payment company for almost a month. We ended up having to pay an additional two months membership despite constant arguing with the company because of \"corporate policy.\" EVEN THOUGH we waited until our yearly contract was up (and, by the way, we only went a handful of times during that contract) to cancel.\n\nI do not recommend this gym to anyone. Even despite the cancellation process being a nightmare, I promised myself (and them) that I would not let anyone else join them because of the way that we were treated.",

It was bonus because they had online appointment scheduling, so I knew I could get an appointment right away. I wasn't sure what I was getting into, but I was desperate, and even tried to go to Supercuts to try to get my hair fixed. (Luckily supercuts had closed early that day). When I pulled up, I wasn't sure what to expect because it was in a strip mall next to a grocery store. I was afraid that my mangled, page-boy haircut was going to be turned into something even worse, but I ended up having a great experience. I got my haircut by Kristen Baiocco, who got right to business without a lot of small talk, which I prefer. I don't like it when salon or spa workers are super chatty since I feel a lot of pressure to engage in conversation instead of enjoying the experience. Introvert problems...\n\nWith my original attempt to get my haircut fixed, I had showed the stylist a picture of a certain haircut, and she insisted that I was showing her the same haircut that I already had on my head, even though my hair looked more like Prince Valium's haircut...  When I showed the picture to Kristen, she took a quick glance at it before she got to work. I was nervous bc it seemed like she barely took a look, but it turns out the girl knows what she's doing. She managed to fix my previous haircut into the one resembling the picture I showed her, and answered some questions I had about styling tips. I walked out feeling good about my hair for the first time since I realized I had gotten a bad cut, and although I'm growing my hair out again and there are closer salons, I'll probably end up going back to Kristen.",

The cardio equipment is quality and they have a whole row of new elliptical type machines with built in fans! Tanning is bad but if you need some vitamin D you can use the stand up beds for free.\n\nI wish there was a gym, at this price, where I live...I'm lucky to be able to go to this gym free of charge while I stay at the Residence Inn on business in Tucson.",

  "text": "I love Orangetheory Fitness! This is the first workout that I have ever been able to do consistently for over a year now! There is a good mix of cardio and weights and I really like that I can mix it up on my own as well. Sometimes I will do the spin bike or elliptical to change it up too. Which is what I need! I am not the type of person that can do the same workout over and over. The classes are always different and changing which keeps it fun and challenging. \nI can also see changes especially in how fast I can run. When I first started a year ago, my \"base pace\" was 5.0, now it's​ over 6 MPH and my fastest mile I had ever run was 9:45. A few months ago, it was 8:30. And they always do \"benchmark\" workouts so you can see your progress! Which keeps it inspiring to see the improvements!\nThe staff is always so friendly, they remember me by name! (Which with how many members they have is really saying something!) The coaches are so good and motivating! They cheer you on throughout the class and really encourage you to push yourself! And there are always alternatives if anyone is unable to do any movement for any reason. \nSeriously, I love OTF. It was intimidating at first but now I go 4 days a week and absolutely love it.",

  "text": "This is such a great place for us.  I have enjoyed their youth sports for my kiddo since he was a little tot!  In fact, I loved it so much that I joined the team (no pun intended!) and got hired on part time in the Sports Department (which is now many years ago!).   Everyone who works there is so passionate about making this a  great experience for the kids to get moving and get started with sports.  There are the basics like basketball, T-ball, soccer, and flag football not to mention Tot Kwon Do, Judo and Gym & Swim.  The coaching is often done by our super fabulous parents and volunteers, but many times it is our wonderful staff who steps in to coach.  The director provides guidance and good structure.\n\nI really don't know what I would do if my kiddo wasn't able to spend his summers at their summer camp.  They have regular camp, artsy-camps, sports-camps, camps with special focus and content.  The preparation that goes into doing a camp is enormous, and it pays off with great fun for the kids, and is a safe place that gives some measure of comfort for the parents as well. They have very strict pick-up rules, and make drop-off soooo easy, too. \n\nThe rest of the facility is wonderful as well, and the staff is top-notch.",

  "text": "Its the best gym in the area which may not be saying all that much when the competition of a bunch of dirty LA Fitness.  The place is brand new with a pretty fantastic indoor pool and quality cardio and weight area.  They are in the process of building an outdoor pool which will be available to members for what I'm told will be a pretty hefty surcharge.  If you have kids the Y will be your best option to get them involved with sports lessons.  From swimming to basketball the directors here really take pride in putting on quality programs and I can attest that my daughter loves it.  2 hour daycare per day is also a nice perk for those of us who need a break from the litter once in a while.\n\nI will say this...  The Ambler YMCA is only a year old.  Community centers often do not age well.  Equipment wears out or breaks and often does not get properly maintained.  Floors, locker rooms and heavily used areas show their wear quite rapidly and if they are not replaced make the place look run down and worn out.  The real test for this place will be when the time times to start making repairs.  Will they make the investment to keep the place spotless or will it go downhill?  Only time will tell.  In the meantime as soon as they build a Lifetime Fitness in the area we'll all jump ship because that place is the gold standard of gyms and since moving to Ambler from Scottsdale, AZ we're counting the days till they decide to expand to this area.",

  "text": "Cleanliness 3/5\nEquipment 3/5\nStaff/Service 1/5\n\nI've been to Snap Fitness for more than 3 years. Snap has been there for more than 8 years and it continues to keep up great and clean. Bathrooms aren't dirty and are kept up nicely. The gym itself may have a few spots that seem dirty, but nothing too noticeable. The variety of machines are great and there is something for anything you want to do. They also recently brought in new equipment. Sadly, it isn't something that the gym need in priority. Although there are a variety of equipment to use, there's only one set. For instance, there's only one set of free weights, so if someone has the weights you want, you'd have to wait. Also, there's only one squat rack. There are 4 total barbell benches, so that's good. Some equipment such as the treadmills are a bit outdated, and sometimes some machines may be broken and left to \"out of order\" for almost a month. Other than that, snap is a very convenient gym because it is open 24/7. Snap has everything you need, you just need to probably come early if you don't want the equipment to be occupied by another individual. \n\nOne important point to make, Snap is very understaffed. I would work out and many different times and there would only be one staff member at the front desk and not keep watch or just observing the gym every now and then. In case if someone were hurt or needed something, a staff member probably wouldn't be there. Other Gyms have 3 or more staff on duty always overlooking the gym.",

  "text": "We moved from Collegeville area to Ambler in July 2011. Although not a member, I had visited the Spring Valley Y on a few occasions. It is almost identical to the Ambler location. We moved here and joined the Y after a tour and discussing the cost and the fact they were in the process of building a pool outside (like Spring Valley). Although the cost for Ambler is about $8-10 more a month than Spring Valley, we justified it with the difference in childcare cost. At Ambler, it's included in your membership, but at Spring Valley you pay $1/hour. Being pregnant with my second child, I figured Ambler worked out to be a better deal. \n\nThese are the reasons I'm rating this beautiful facility with 2 stars:\n\nI recently received an email stating pool memberships are now available for purchase. WHAT???? They are charging the members (who already pay top dollar for their membership) $400 to use the outdoor pool. $800 for non- members. This was not conveyed to us at the time we enrolled.\n\nThe children's classes are almost impossible to get into. I've been a member for almost a year and my daughter has gotten into swim lessons twice, but the first time, we had to go to Abington because Ambler was full. I try enrolling her first thing in the morning on the day enrollment starts, but most classes for 3 year olds are usually already full.\n\nI enrolled my daughter online for camp this year. I paid $50 for a deposit and the remainder was supposed to come out at a later date. We had a change of plans, so I called to cancel camp and they said I had to come in to fill out a form. I went in and they said I would lose the $50 deposit. I asked if they could put it towards a class or swim lessons and they said \"no.\" REALLY???\n\nThe place is gorgeous and new, but next to impossible to work out in the mornings when my daughter is in preschool. It's packed. I haven't tried going any other time because my schedule doesn't allow.\n\nOn a good note, the dance teacher, Dana, and the swim instructor, Caitlyn, are awesome with the kids. They seem to genuinely like what they do. Too bad it's so hard to get into classes with them.  Guessing we'll be canceling our membership in the near future. $97/month is a lot to pay to not have use of the entire facility.",

The weight room is spacious and, after the first week or so of the semester is over, the crowd usually thins out and you don't have very much trouble finding machines, weights, space, etc. Their are several racquetball courts, and you can check out the equipment to play. The same can be said about the basketball courts. \n\nReily offers all kinds of classes, from ballroom dancing to Kendo and Martial arts. They also offer a variety of fitness courses. \n\nThis place loses one star because, though the service is good, it's nothing more. It's staffed by students, and having been a student employee myself, I know that they are probably highly un-motivated and working for little to no money.  Their apathy is understandable.\n\nBeyond that (which I totally sympathize with) Reily is a nice place to workout with all kinds of free amenities for members.

  "text": "So, I will upfront admit that I am a bally's fitness, l.a. fitness brat.  I am accustomed to huge two story locations with day cares, tons of mirrors, full locker rooms, pools, saunas, packed schedule of classes.  Now the offset of that (back in the day) was that you were in some crazy contract for ever and paying 40-60 bucks a month.  Although pricing changes for each location and depending on the placement of the moon and the sky, most people at anytime fitness have a 1 year contract for between 20-30 bucks.  So, you know, you get what you pay for. \n\nAt this location, as compared to my experience at Bullard location, you may get a little less than you pay for.  The space is extremely cramped. That being said the equipment is quality equipment, they do have the standard classes, and it is generally clean. There are no lockers just cubby holes by the member entrance/exit door.  The parking lot can get crowded when the dance studio and dojo are having classes.  The classes fill up and it gets dangerously crowded and hot in the studio.  There is one shower.  Fortunately, I haven't had to wait for cardio equipment.  Most of the people working out at the time I am there are in class or are on weights.\n\nI think the most annoying thing about this location is the service. By the time I arrive at 6 or 7 in the evening, the staff has zoned completely out.  They are nice but not at all proactive.  The first time I went to this location, one of the members let me in the front door and I stood there for a good 2 minutes before I had to then go in to the office and say, hey I am here on a free pass.  No tour was given, no information about classes (until I asked), no policies, and no membership prices.  I loved that it wasn't a hard sell but I expect 1) for people to be aware of people coming in and out of the locations and 2) for you to care and follow up with me on whether I had a good experience or not. Also, with the classes, the teacher was late and her music skipped.  However, everybody has an off day so I am going to reserve my final opinion on that.  Especially since her zumba choreography was fire!\n\nFor me, working in CBD and living in New Orleans East, this location is more convenient because I can stop there on my way home.  But I think they should step up there game as more planet finesses arrive in the area and more smaller boutique fitness centers pop up they are not going to be able to just win on price.",

The trainers are very hands on and motivating. My experience did have a few negatives though... First, it is very pricey. $70/ month plus $75 to start. You also have to pay 2 full months upfront. So I am not able to commit to the club. If they lowered their prices/offered specials of some kind, I would definitely become a member. Second, I felt very pressured to buy a membership at the end of my class, which I hate. I am not at a car dealership, I'm at a gym! Anyway, it was fun and intense. I'd recommend giving it a try.",

To be clear, I am not a member but I used my ClassPass account to visit while I was in town for a trip. I really, really needed a hot tub so I looked for a gym to visit with this amenity. \n\nThe place was great. I signed up for a couple of fitness classes - they have group classes- and they were each a circuit style and to be honest more challenging than I expected, but with circuit classes you can always push yourself to go harder so that might be it. \n\nThere is a very large weight area inside with a running track indoor around it. But what I came for was the spa area! There is a hot tub, sauna, and steam room as well as a small pool. I was able to spend a nice 45 min or so alternating between the hot tub and steam/sauna rooms and I was really in heaven. If you are coming and want to do the same I recommend checking the water aerobics schedule- immediately after the spa area will be pretty full with people finishing the water aerobics class. \n\nShowers are present and lockers and changing rooms are ample. \n\nIt's relatively no frills in certain ways but also has every amenity I would want so I was very pleased - if I lived near here I would join!",

  "text": "I was home for the holidays and staying with my parents in Merion.  LA Fitness is 1.5 miles away and conveniently close.  Their website claimed that if you provided your email address, they would email a 3 day pass immediately.   This pass did not appear in my email, though the website stated that it had been sent right away. I called LA Fitness and explained  that I was from out of town and just visiting for the weekend.  I was told this wasn't a  problem and could come over and get my pass.   Not so easy!  First, I was asked to show an ID.  Not sure what the point was when I clearly was not joining.  Second, the guy at the desk gives me a 3 day pass but then takes it back.  He hands my drivers license to a salesperson and makes me sit down with him.  He then makes me fill out the same paperwork they have people fill out for memberships. Even after explaining that I did not live here and had no intention of joining, he still continued to interrogate me on my fitness goals, my weight, height AND then made me take a test to see the percentage of my body fat.   Then, he goes over my BMI, fat percentage.........while snidely making rude remarks of \"where I am\" and \"where I need to be\".   Bottom line, after all this, he says that though the guy at the front desk gave me a 3 day pass, it won't work since I'm out of state.  The pass only works if you live in PA and are no more than 25 miles from the facility.  Though I clearly explained that in the beginning, he wasted 15 minutes of my time, insulted my fitness level and body weight and then told me I couldn't work out.  He said he would take me on a tour.  I was infuriated and insulted at this point and just walked out.  I restrained myself from making any rude comments.  I am sure REUBEN (got no problem stating his name, Chris R. is better than me) is not characteristic of all the salespeople there.  However, he was a pompous, rude, capital A--HOLE!  If you're visiting and out of town, go to Philadelphia Sports Club in Ardmore-right across the train station.  They gave me a 3 day pass-no tour or interrogation or fat analysis needed.",

  "text": "Let's be honest. Compared to 24 Hour Fitness clubs, FFC's in Chicago, and even our local Elmwood Fitness Center Elmwood location Snap falls short. This location is a very small gym (700 sq ft maybe) with a few ellipticals and treadmills. It also has one Smith machine, some free weights, and a few other weight machines. That's it. \n\nI go here mainly because it is rarely ever crowded (only a handful of ppl before 6am) and everyone there just comes to work out. This is not a social gym like Elmwood.\n\nAll of the Snap's that I have been to have been immaculately clean! Love that. \n\nEach location charges different rates, though, so shop around to get the best deal and lowest enrollment fee (I have seen some locations charge $100+ to enroll). I joined the River Ridge location simply because it was $5 less per month ($34.95/month) than the other ones in Metairie/Kenner. Plus they only wanted $20 for enrollment. \n\nIf you want to take spinning, cardio, or zumba classes you won't find it at any Snap gym. If you desire a pool, a basketball court, or racquetball courts you are out of luck. I only recommend any Snap gym if you are looking to do strength/cardio training ONLY.",

However, once I walked in the front door there was clearly a reason I deleted this from memory and never returned.\n\nWhy LA Fitness kept this club open when they took over Lifestyle Family Fitness, I have no idea.\n\nIt was freezing cold inside and the layout of this club just makes it feel even colder than the actual temperature.\n\nWhile the bathroom areas of the men's locker room were exceptionally clean, everything else about being in here motivated me to get done and leave.\n\nAll the cardio equipment is pushed off into a dark corner, which is hard to imagine considering how dimly lit this entire place is in the first place.\n\nAlso, the variety of cardio machines is subpar. Two modern machines that I regularly use at Hyde Park were not even available here.\n\nLooking over at the front desk and sales area, I never saw more than two employees at one time.\n\nTo say this location is not very inviting and welcoming would be an understatement.\n\nI can only guess that LA Fitness maintains this location because the rent is so cheap in a dying plaza that only features a Walgreen's and the token JJ Smoothy near a health club, but working out here on a regular basis would make me ask for a significant discount off my current monthly dues.",

  "text": "Yup, this is a pretty amazing gym! Whether this is your first time rock climbing or you've got some boulders under your belt, this place has routes for you. If you've ever been to the Tampa gym you'll feel a little spoiled here: each route is color coordinated so its easy-er to figure out where to go next; the problems are a bit more spaced out so it doesn't feel supper cluttered; the belay routes are higher, not including \"the pit;\" their is a private section for members with a private rock wall and actually weights and gym equipment; there more seats to sit and watch or take a break, plus they doubles are storage spaces; the walls here are painted so it give the whole gym this cool and new feel. You can tell there was a lot of thought put into how this gym was made. \nI'd definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good time. You don't have to know how to rock climb to have fun here, they make it real easy to start. Which leads me to my only gripe, the rating system is a series of 5 upside-down triangles. 1 triangle (vb-v0) being the easiest and 5 triangle (v8-up) being the hardest. It doesn't make it easy for beginners to tell which ones they can try and which routes to steer away from, but it also makes the jump for 3 to 4 triangles and 4 to 5 triangles really high and sometimes frustrating. \nAll in all the tampa gym will still be my home, but dang St. Pete, 5 stars!",

I'm not sure about anyone else, but I used to belong to Sweat where I never visibly saw the gym being cleaned. I've also been to PSSC and another City Fitness location. I've even tried Planet Fitness! I've seen almost all of the gym options in the city, and I've gotta say this is probably my favorite. I wish they had a little bit more real estate and rooms for functional training, but I'm impressed with the amount of machines and the layout (multi level with great views) they have been able to achieve. \n\nIf you're the gym rat who likes a younger gym rat crew to motivate you and a clean facility, this is your spot. You can generally find parking nearby, though you may have to circle a few times. And get ready to parallel park! \n\nAmendment: updating to 5 stars because the improvements over the last few months to the facilities have been fantastic! Great job everyone!",

I checked out SouthRACs website and requested information for a free 3 day pass. \n\nWith sweatpants in hand, I headed to the facility for a tour. I was greeted and introduced to Ron who would tell me about the club. He asked me what I was looking for (weight loss, strength training, personal trainer, etc.) and showed me around. I was pleased with the variety and cleanliness of the club and, even though the parking lot was nearly full, there were plenty of machines available. \n\nI decided to sign up and then I remembered I had the 3 day pass. Since I signed up on the first day, he waived my first full month of membership. I was able to spend a little more than I would have for that first month and getting a personal training package (4 sessions) for just $99, a savings of $100 off the regular 4-session price of $199.\n\nI'm looking forward to getting started with my trainer who will be able to teach me how to maximize workouts also provide nutrition advice. SouthRAC provides help in all aspects of health and fitness and so far the people I have met, both employees and patrons, have been friendly and supportive.",

Also, I called to cancel my membership in May, checked up on it in June because I got a charge, and found out that they will not honor the cancellation I made in May because they \"have no proof of it\" (b), even though I am a student with very little money and had to cancel the membership because my violent, drunk boyfriend and I broke up and I had to leave town as quickly as possible (c).  They try to push you to sign up for year-length commitments (it's cheaper, just do it!  You can send proof of an address if you move later!) and do not leave off when you say you don't want to.  For these reasons I think that Fitness Connection is full of people who are pushy, maniacally money-motivated, and disinterested in their customers' health, safety, and well-being.\n\n(a) For example, the free session with a personal trainer is time for them to try to railroad you into signing up for either a personal trainer or small group fitness.  If you join the gym but you don't know how to use most of the equipment you are out of luck, unless you can spend hundreds more per month on someone to show you how to use it!!  \n(b) Funny, I would have thought that if they needed proof of it, their employee would have given me some proof.\n(c) They have no empathy or regard for other people.",

  "text": "Ok, where to start.. \n\nSo my husband and I decided to join this gym 2 weeks ago, we initially chose this one because the price is great and it has a daycare which is a must. We each have the $19.95/mo, with that we can go to both gyms and bring one friend anytime we go and all the other stuff which I don't remember. Not bad, right? No, price is great and I'll be honest, they offer a lot; cycle, yoga, water zumba, regular zumba, small group training, one on one training and much more. When you sign up, you're scheduled a one on one health assessment with some one that is supposed to last an hour. This is where all my frustration started. I will say, I do not see any issues with the gym or equipment itself except that I saw at least 3 of the cardio machines out of order. Stuff happens right? Anyhow, back to the health assessment. I had mine scheduled for 4pm, I showed up at approximately 3:55, that gave me about 5 minutes to go put my stuff away and very sure I was ready for my appointment. I told the front desk gal at about 3:58 that I had an appointment and told her with who. She told me to sit down and he will be right with me. She picked up the phone and overhead I heard her announce to the staff that so and so's client was there. So I waited, I looked at my watch, 4:03... ok, I understand some clients like to take their time and have questions afterwards...  then it's 4:08.. I started to get a little frustrated, I mean, I'm supposed to be on time, shouldn't he? So I decided that if it went as far as 4:15 I would leave and reschedule with someone esle. Well, at 4:13 the trainer went behind the counter, didn't even come up to me personally and introduce himself, and motioned to me to follow him. Mind you, the whole time I was waiting, not one of the 3 ladies at the desk came over to even apologize for the wait or inform me how long it would be. \n\nWe sat down at the desk to go over goals and nutrition and other elements of a healthy life style and on the sheet it said that I would be shown 8 different machines or exercises for different parts of my body. My main goal is weight training since I do a lot of other training with a trainer other times per week; I informed him of this. He asked me if I was familiar with the TRX, I am very familiar so I asked if he could possible show me some more weights. Well... he had me warm up on the bike for 8 minutes while he went to get himself a protein shake and then he took me straight to the TRX and had me do squats, lunges, and jump squats, which I am already very familiar with on the TRX. Then, he took me to the squat rack and showed me 2 other variations of squats. These two are the only two exercises he showed me that I didn't know. Then he said I was done.. at 4:45! So he was 13 minutes late, and then talked for about 15 minutes, and the rest was what I explained above. It's like he didn't listen to a work I said or considered what I had asked him to show me. \nI understand this is a free service for joining the gym and that I'm not paying for a full-on personal training session, but come on, he didn't even do his job in my opinion. If I'm given a piece of paper telling me what to expect for the fitness assessment, I kind of expect at least some of it to happen and definitely get my full hour. I am very displeased.",

The layout of the pool is easy to navigate with restrooms on your right upon entering and all of the attractions beyond that. Lifeguards seem professional and everything is very clean. They offer something for everyone, even if you can't swim well (or at all). There's a toddler splash zone that is fenced in (hallelujah for the mom's of darting 2-year-olds), a bigger kid splash area equipped with a small slide and a bucket dump, a lap area, lazy river, 3 slides, wave rider and aqua rock climbing. If none of that tickles your fancy, maybe you can rent a cabana, or bring in a picnic. The concessions seemed very reasonable as well ($1.25 for popcorn). \n\nTip- come after 4 for half priced tickets.",

  "text": "Where do I begin? Let's start with the filth. There is not a male custodian. The showers look like something out of a bad prison movie. I have been there all hours of operation and granted, the people who frequent the gym are filthy. I have seen people spit on the sauna floor. I have seen people keep equipment, and then not put it back. I don't think there is anything that can be done about the nasty ones who think they are alone  at the gym. The racketball courts have been unusable for years now. YEARS!!! They finally put up a wall similar to Trumps wall. There is nothing behind it. So now no courts just a wall to cover up that part of the gym. Say Whaaa? I went to Tampa to the L.A. Fitness and it was a complete different situation. When I opened the doors to the facility I swear I heard an angel chorus. Clean, friendly staff, and most of all no spitters. Stay home and work out in your living room. If you go to this dump you may come home with filth on your shoes, and a disease from lack of cleanliness. WARNING!!!! STAY AWAY.",

  "text": "It's something of a \"treat\" for me to go to a salon in this price range. I have read mixed reviews on this place, but with the half off coupon for first time customers I figured I'd give it a shot. My stylist was Seiko, a tiny cute asian woman. She was friendly, and not only knew what I was going for when I told her I wanted some style while growing my hair out from a pixie cut, but had idea's on how to fix my bangs perfectly. She was talkative, complimentary (Flattery will get you everywhere), friendly, and most importantly, gave me exactly what I wanted. I left the salon feeling cute and confident.\nI can't vouch for salon services other than shampoo, cut, and style, but from my first experience, it's 5 star worthy.",

From their facility, to the small class sizes, to the workouts to their amazing personalities- it is beyond evident that they love what they do! \n\nI started off with personal training and switched over to the group classes (with the occasional PT depending on my schedule) not only do you see and feel the difference with your body, but you see and feel the difference with your energy and mentality working out with them. Even at 5am I leave feeling like I can take on the world! They don't boast or brag about their clients they just let their work speak for itself and that's something rare in this industry here. \n\nNo matter your age, size or fitness level you need to be at Apex! They will definitely bring out the inner lion in you!",

See below.\n\n1)  showers are what you would call lukewarm at best. There are many people from foreign countries here and they're probably not used to real hot American showers, So they don't care.\n\n2) You get your butt up there to workout, It is a great incentive to have a sauna.  however, this sauna is frequently broken.  They claim it is because people pour water on the calls. But neither have I ever seen people do that nor have I ever seen a sauna where that was really a problem. It seems like an excuse not to keep the sauna in good repair\n\n\n. Overall I would recommend this gym.  Highly!",

Everyone from staff to members were so friendly and no judgement! The Zumba classes and instructor are amazing ! In my third week of three classes a week and I already feel at home . I changed to a membership right away ! I have not tried the pool, hot tub and sauna but they are on my list and are beautiful! What a happy , no pressure environment ! A very diverse group with one common theme - welcome encouragement ! My only regret is I waited so long to try. The gym has been in the same location and ownership over twenty years !

  "text": "When a friend of mine starting asking me to go to Planet Fitness with her I was skeptical. I've been a member at other gyms before and remember clearly the high-pressure environment they foster. Pressure from the sales staff to renew, upgrade, and add more to your monthly plan, pressure from the trainers to book expensive private sessions because you weren't \"working out right,\" and pressure from the other members themselves as female members would saunter in with full makeup and curled hair and jacked men would gawk as their grunts grew louder. That environment is so not me. I would much rather run with my dogs or bike down to the beach for my daily exercise.\nAfter a few months, I finally accepted my friend's invitation. Being a \"Black Card\" member, my friend could allow me join her whenever she went and I figured there is no harm in trying it out. I was blown away by the atmosphere at PF. I have currently gone as a guest 3 times and not once have I been pressured by staff to enroll. The staff is friendly and sociable. The gym members are mostly there in groups and the atmosphere among them is friendly. Lots of motivating words are passed from one to another.  High-fives are given after a friend achieves their goals. The equipment is clean and wonderfully maintained with plenty of cardio options including treadmills, stair machines, ellipticals, bikes, and spin bikes. The machines for weight training are in sections clearly marked for \"abs, arms, legs,\" etc. There are areas for \"express workouts\" that are taught with a trainer who optimizes your workout to get maximum results in less time. The locker rooms are pristine and feature lockers, bathrooms, showers, a private scale (no more weighing yourself in front of the entire gym population! YAY!) a hair dryer, and a vanity. The best part, this gym is open 24/7 so late nights and early mornings are never a problem. \nEverything I've mentioned is included in a regular membership at $10 a month. If you choose to upgrade to a Black Card member you will also receive unlimited use of the tanning beds, hydro-massage beds, and unlimited guest privileges. This is, by far, the most perks for least amount of money I've seen at any gym. \nThe only critique I have is that all of the machines connect to your phone using an i-pod cord. Being a staunch Samsung user, I find it irritating that I'm unable to utilize the charging/headphone feature of the machines because of this. The machines should be upgraded to include a usb jack. My complaint is a tiny one, as I can still plug my headphones into the machine and watch tv shows on one of the 18 screens or plug directly into my phone to listen to music. \nOverall, I would encourage everyone to visit Planet Fitness just to check it out. I guarantee you will return.",

I've never had to wait for equipment. They also usually rotate in some \"trial\" equipment that you can vote on; if it's popular enough, they'll try to work it onto the equipment floor.\n\nNIFS will cost you ~$47/month, which seemed a little steep at first, but you can really get your value out of NIFS...if you want to. They offer TONS of classes -- cycling, Body Pump, yoga, Bosu, and more. You can also get an exercise prescription, meet 1:1 with a specialist, and more.\n\nYou can save about $30 total by paying for a year upfront; I think paying upfront should save you a little more.\n\nMy favorite thing about NIFS is that it's all sorts of people who are there because they care about fitness.

A lot.\n\nFirst thing you should know is that this place is hard core.  Each class consists of time on a treadmill and time on the floor with weights.  You may be thinking:  why would I spend $20 to use a treadmill?  Ohhhh you just wait and see!  This is no regular run on the treadmill.  We're talking steep inclines, lots of sprinting, sideways running and more creative torture methods.  The weight portions are pretty standard except you're coupled over dying from the run you just did so of course it's harder!\n\nNow, I am by no means a runner.  In fact, I absolutely 100% hate running.  But I'm no stranger to intense cardio.  That being said even their beginner's pace is killing me.  We're talkin' my face is still bright pink almost an hour after class!  I guess I must be a masochist because I bought 30 sessions just to ensure I'd keep going.  If there's one thing I hate more than running it's losing money.\n\nThe only thing that rubs me the wrong way is that their marketing is clearly effective.  They've done a great job acting like a bad ass place where only hot people want to go.  All the people in class are already fit, svelte, and good looking.  And it seems like the instructors are trying a little too hard to be \"hard core.\"  But maybe I'm the only one who'd like an occasional encouragement with \"YOU CAN DO IT!\" instead of \"WHATEVER YOU DO DON'T SLOW DOWN\"?  They clearly do not believe in positive reinforcement at Barry's Boot Camp!\n\nFree parking in the ramp next door.  \n\nAll that being said I'd encourage you to try out a class.  You'll get a killer workout and you'll be glad you did!  Now please don't make fun of me if you see me in class and I look like I'm about to keel over.",

  "text": "My review of Future Fitness is somewhat limited, as I joined this gym for one reason only:  Pool access. So I can't comment on the gym floor, classes, etc., but here's my review.  If possible, I'd give it 2.5 stars - somewhere between \"Meh\" and \"A-OK.\"\n\nWhen you first arrive at Future Fitness to tour the facility, be prepared for the HARD SELL.  Also be prepared to be talked to like an idiot.  I explained to the sales person that I was a triathlete, only looking for a place to swim.  Clearly, I'm not new to the gym atmosphere.  Yet, he still felt the need to continue on with his sales script, and explain to me a bunch of BS about how to get results, and making lifestyle changes, etc.  Annoying.  He then proceeded to show me the entire gym, even though I was only interested in the pool.  That is understandable, except that the pool was the very last thing he showed me, and the thing he spent the least amount of time on.  Then it was time to talk price.  I had to go through 3 rounds of \"negotiations\" before he reached their \"current specials\" which were a little more in my price range. \n\nYou may ask why one would join after being degraded like this.  The answer is simple:  I really needed a pool, and this is the most convenient place for me.  All other options were either too expensive, or just totally out of the way.  \n\nSo, the pool:  The pool is actually pretty decent.  They don't have any water aerobics classes here, so the don't crank the water temperature up.  It's always kept at a nice temperature that is slightly on the cool side when you jump in, but perfect after just one lap.  I find the pool to be clean, and the fact that its salt water, not chlorine, is a huge plus.  My skin and hair are grateful!  The only down side to the pool is that it's an odd length - 21 meters.  I suppose that's just due to the amount of room they had to work with when building it.  There is also a hot tub, which I often relax in for 5 or 10 minutes following my swim.  \n\nThe only other part of the gym I use is, of course, the locker room.  The locker room itself is pretty decent, with various nooks where you can find slightly more privacy if desired.  They do need to do a better job at cleaning the bathrooms throughout the day.  There are always a couple of toilets filled with TP, and trash on the floor.  The showers are nice - I just use them to rinse the salt water off my body following my swim.  There are 3 or 4 vanity stations which would make it easy if you had to fully shower and get ready for work or something after your workout.  \n\nOverall, the pool is decent, and that's why I come here.  But I'd have a hard time recommending the gym as a whole to someone.  If you don't need a pool, or can deal with the limited Wahoos schedule, go to my first gym, my home, my love, Cherry Hill Health & Racquet Club.",

  "text": "First timers get a \"buy one get one\" offer if you let them know it is your first class.  This is such a good idea because classes are expensive ($15) and I like to try a bunch of different specialty classes before I buy a package at the gym.  This is a great place to burn tons of calories and spin is such a great option for any fitness level, you differentiate your workout by how much weight to add to your bike so anyone can do it.  I loved the loud music and videos playing while we rode.  Our instructor was very energetic also and I wish wish wish I could remember her name but sadly cannot.  I went on a Wednesday night at 6:30 and class lasted about 45 minutes.  There was an Ab class after wards that I believe is included but I had to go so I didn't try that out.  There are towels provided though (get one) and you feel great after wards.  Highly recommended!",

  "text": "Moved away for a year to Chicago and just moved back and re-signed at Anytime in Westchase. Since I've been working out here for 3.5 years (minus one year away) I will give my pros/cons. I think somebody whining about old mats is a joke, I can't say I've ever used the mats, but if I was into something where I needed one (like Yoga) I would buy one and bring it to the gym anyway.\n\nPros:\n-Nice, newer equipment\n-Considering this is the heart of Westchase, this gym is rarely crowded\n-Great selection of machines, free weights, and cardio equpment\n-Friendly staff\n-Tanning for $10 if that's your thing\n-Cheap for all club access\n-Location!\n-Not a huge space, but they have done well making sure the layout isn't crowded like the YMCA Express down the road\n-Always CLEAN\n\nCons:\n-Stupid \"upgrades\", they replaced a decline bench with a smith machine because you can \"do more\" on a smith machine. Well, no serious weight lifter I know uses a smith machine for anything, they want free weights for bench/squat/deads. Glad to know my \"club enhancement fee\" went towards getting rid of equipment people actually use. \n-NO bench press? Is this real life? The aforementioned smith machine does not count. It's a tough pill to swallow to have to wheel a bench into the squat rack to do bench press every time. I could tolerate when there was at least a decline bench, but now that there are two smith machines that see little use other than old men doing bench with the bar, or girls doing squats with the bar, it's pretty annoying. \n\nChuck one of the new smith machines in the trash, then change the layout to acommodate a barbell bench or two (or a flat and a decline but the flat provides more flexibility), and this place is a 5/5!\n\nSeriously, who's idea was it to add a second smith machine...I doubt there was a bunch of customer feedback demanding a second. I never see anyone using either (except for the aforementioned groups, and then only occasionally).",

They moved all the weights upstairs to make more room for the high schoolers on the first floor, and moved all the aerobic machines to a new, crowded room that still has weights at one end. They shortened the track, which now runs through the weight area, and people are almost always standing on it if you're trying to run. They've closed the upper pool deck, where many of us used to use to stretch, for no apparent reason. And during the entire pandemic, they haven't enforced mask use at all, so if you tried to run on the track, you were typically running between a bunch of maskless, heavy-breathing weight lifters. Yuck. The pools are nice, though they still have no recreational swim for my kids and the slide is closed. Sorry to sound like such a downer, but you can probably do better.",

  "text": "This Y location, as with most Y's, is a multifaceted place of fitness and physical education, suitable for families, couples, singles, seniors and the disabled.\n\nVery affordable. Childcare and classes for those who are interested. Art, financial and diabetic classes for those who sign up. Day camp for the kiddos in the summer. \n\nThere are discounts for military and veterans, and possible sponsorships for folks who have trouble paying for the full membership fees each month.\n\nNow, the bad news that may be a downfall for some (I almost let it keep me from going back, but no...won't let it). \n\nThe staff is (mostly) very nice, extremely nice in fact, especially the people at the front desk and the lifeguards. \n\nBut there is one rather creepy busybody that works around the weights who thinks he knows everything to do with diet and exercise, and will throw people out for \"improper footwear\" or make comments about people's weight, or what they are wearing. He had the nerve to stare at me, looking up the leg of my clothing, wearing a skort and walk over and tell me that \"skirts were not allowed.\" I was wearing a very modest outfit, as I always do, but I guess that only tiny ladies showing their calves and breasts off were okay with him. I invited him to buy me a new wardrobe if he didn't like my footwear nor my outfit (workout clothes are expensive and I wore a long skort that goes past my knees that I usually wear to church). \n\nHe also intrusively inquired as to what I was doing to lose weight and began giving me unsolicited advice. He was so awkward, flirty and leering at women, and generally embarrassing that I felt sorry for him, and for the last he is married to. A good friend of mine who frequents the Y said he is also known to make homophobic comments and make her gay friend feel uncomfortable. I wondered how he lasted this long, positioning himself to look up my skort as I used the gym equipment. I know I'm not the only one that has issues with him. I won't name him because I have to see him almost anytime I go in and either he eventually will lose his job just because of the way he treats people, or he'll get some \"sensitivity training\" as is the way of the world nowadays. But he won't ever cause me to think bad of the YMCA because sometimes bad apples slip into places. \n\nGive the Y a try if you like fitness and being social (I don't like being social but hey, whatever floats your boat).",

Working out on your own in the little free space they have. BUT, the problem is that there is no space because other people are already taking up that extra space.\n\nTHEN, they have a lot of treadmills and ellipticals. The only problem is that not all of them work. So when it is crowded, and it looks like there are a few machines open; they're not because they're broken. They are also broken a long time. You'll see the same \"being worked on\" sign on the same machine for about a month before it gets fixed. \n\nThe pool is a nice perk, but you have to look at the hours to make sure you are not going when there is a water aerobics class going on. The water is warm, and the hot tub is a nice feature. \n\nSome of the same gym reps I see are really nice. They always greet you and tell you to have a good workout. Some of them are definitely sub-par. You'd stand there waiting for them to scan your card while they are talking with friends or another coworker. I could just as easily scan it myself.\n\nThe classes are pretty neat, and reasonable. The instructors are pretty motivating. \n\nThe price isn't worth it. $33 for a gym that never seems to have enough gym equipment isn't worth it to me. On top of that, there is a pretty big membership fee. If there wasn't a cancellation fee, I would have cancelled months ago.",

  "text": "It's honestly laughable that I was a member of LA Fitness before joining NIFS. And, that I gave LA a 3 star review. I want to smack myself in the face. \n\nThe National Institute for Fitness & Sport has EVERYTHING you could ever want in a gym, in my opinion. No contracts, you pay month to month. The joining fee is a little hefty, I couldn't sweet talk my way into not paying it, maybe you'll have better luck than me. Parking is included in the garage across the street for those who are not IUPUI students and finding parking or navigating the garage has never been an issue for me.\n\nOne of my biggest issues with other gyms is how difficult it is to find a treadmill or other cardio machine during peak times. I haven't had that problem once at NIFS. Additionally, I love that each machine has its own TV with a headphone plug in - my runs fly by as I watch Southern Charm and Kardashians re-runs. (Don't judge.) \n\nOther great aspects: \nIndoor running track \nSeparate weight room (you can avoid the meatheads with ease!)\nLots of mats for stretching\nClean showers and free towels\nSauna, steam room and whirlpool \nDaily locker access with a key you can pin onto your shorts - no more remembering locker combinations! \n\nThey also seem to have a great and professional staff along with member incentives. I've never taken advantage of any of the monthly programs yet, but I definitely want to, because hello, who says no to free stuff?! \n\nTo top it off, there are so. many. classes. You name it - they have it. BodyPump is amazing, as are the yoga and spinning classes. My only complaint - sometimes the times don't work with my schedule, and the weekend classes are definitely limiited. \n\nOverall, I'd recommend NIFS to anyone who lives or works downtown. There are a few drawbacks - hours on the weekend are a little bit more limited than I'd like and the monthly membership is pricey, but its worth it to know I am a member of such a reputable, clean and great facility.",

  "text": "So I live in DC, but while I was visiting family in South Jersey I knew I wanted to make sure I got my barre fix. Found La Belle Fit and their Studio Barre classes, read the reviews, and booked two classes since they sounded great.\n\nMy experience at LBF started out rough. I got there a bit early, checked in, and sat down. The girl working at the front desk seemed confused about my question about the locker room situation and didn't give me any info about the rest of the facility. A few more people came in for my class, checked in, and wandered out. We were all early so I figured they were just wandering around and would be back. Well, with two minutes left until my class, the zumba class going on showed no signs of ending and I turned to the girl at the desk and said \"Am I supposed to be somewhere else?\" She looked at me like I was stupid and said \"um, yea, two doors down.\" I do some front desk time at the studio where I take barre and the online system that both LBF and my studio use is the same, which means I KNOW that there is a little star that appears when someone is new to the facility.  So then why this girl didn't give me a little tutorial and seemed so put off by me not knowing where I was going is beyond me.\n\nI chalked that up to a minor annoyance and walked down to the studio, figuring as long as the class was good, who cared about the snotty front desk assistant. Well, I was in for another \"treat.\" The class began with a bang when the teacher just jumped in and said \"watch me\", rather than explaining what we were doing. After a VERY short warm up (not enough time in my opinion and experience), we began the actual class. I could barely heard the teacher over the music, which wasn't even that loud, so I was constantly a beat behind her, which seemed to make her very upset. The ONLY part of the class that I \"felt\" at all was the thigh work. The \"glute\" portion of the class was really just more thigh work - with nothing at all designed to work your butt. The abs section was just a joke, I could've been sitting down anywhere, doing anything at all. And then there was literally NO stretching until the end of class. When I work a muscle to the point of fatigue and shaking, aka the whole point of barre, I want to stretch it right away, while it's warm, not at the end of class, when I haven't worked on that body part for 45 minutes.\n\nTo top all of that off, I went to go rinse off (though I really didn't need to because I didn't sweat at all due to the nothingness of class), there are no provided towels in the single bathroom. I have NEVER been in a fitness center that prides themselves of being a \"fancy\" establishment, enough that they offer face wash, lotion, body soap, etc. that doesn't provide a towel for you. In fact, I've never been in a fitness center period that doesn't provide towels for you after you shower. \n\nI left LBF with a really bad taste in my mouth and actually didn't go to the second class I had booked. All in all, this was a waste of $40 for 2 classes (actually more expensive that had I booked 2 classes at ANY barre studio in DC, where the cost of living is remarkably higher). I don't know what other options there are for barre in the area, but there has to be something better than this place.",

  "text": "Gold's gym continues to charge even after we cancel. First, cancellation is a hassle... They made both of us come to the gym to submit a membership cancellation. We made the trip and put in our cancellation and yet we continue to be charged. When I called them, they said they have not received our cancellation. They argued that I never put in my cancellation. It took me about 15 calls and countless number of hours on the phone to finally talk to a manager and stop being charged. Seems like an experience that many others are having. SUCH A SCAM.",

  "text": "This LA Fitness is trying their best to steal your money. Just watch out your bank statement every month. I signed up my 6 months training session which started from April 5th 2018, the last charge supposed on September 5th 2018. Then on October 5th, they charged me $200 again since I cancelled mine before October 5th. I have to call bank to dispute this charge. Then the LA FITNESS started to call me, call my husband and call my in laws. I called CORPORATE office and asked my money back, the stupid \"manager \" was like you used 4 classes in October. I said because you guys told me I have 30 days after my training session done to use my rest classes which I did. He said you did not have classes left. Then you used 4 classes. WHAT? I don't know how many classes I still have? I didn't go gym since July and August. I have 8 classes left that I used in October which I still get charged. I just want to say Mt. Laurel LA fitness SUCKS. The operation manager that curly hair lady gave you careless attitude which made you think cancel your membership is the best choice. I cancelled my membership immediately after I talked both this manager and corporate manager. Because they are useless. CHECK your bank account every month. Highlight LAfitness that line. Trust me if you have money problem with them, cancel the membership immediately. Because you never gonna get that money back!!!",

  "text": "Just tried my first Orange Theory class yesterday morning and guess what? I'm a member now. How did that happen? Lol. It happened because I ended up loving the class and my results that much! It's nowhere near my house, so I have to go fifteen minutes out of my way to get there, but it's worth it in my opinion.  \n\nLet me begin by saying that I'm already a moderately active person. I work an office job during the day but I exercise at a regular gym at least 5-6 times a week. I normally do a mixture of weight training and cardio when I go. I've also recently started adding yoga and Pilates once a week to my routine to develop a stronger core. So do I NEED Orange Theory to lose weight? I don't (because I've lost several pounds on my own already), BUT I love their concept of targeting your maximum heart rate zone and believe it will give me the extra push I need to lose these last few pesky pounds. I do have a Fitbit already and use it to monitor my heart rate, but it's a lot more fun when you're in a class setting with a personal trainer and can see your results from the Orange Theory heart monitor on the screen. It made me feel really motivated to stay in the orange zone, which is the recommended zone (based on your stats) to really burn fat.\n\nThe class is a mixture of interval training with cardio and circuit training with weights. It's not for everyone because my fiance tried it with me and hated it lol. However, he has never been a fan of instruction while I've done guided classes for years. It passes by quickly! I recommend trying out one class because it's complimentary and they will loan you a heart monitor. I really like that your results are emailed to you at the end of each class. Some people do complain that it's pricey but you truly get what you pay for and health and fitness are definitely something that are worth the splurge! It amazes me how people are willing to spend hundreds of dollars per month on eating out, cable TV, shopping, etc (you get the idea) but cut corners on health/fitness and only be willing to spend a few bucks on a typical gym membership. At the end of the day, you really can't put a price on the sense of accomplishment you get after you finish a grueling workout that challenges you, or the feeling you get when you look in the mirror and are happy with your physique and progress. You only have one body, so why not take care of it?",

  "text": "This place is overhyped and overpriced.\n\nI purchased a Groupon Sparta Cross fit offered to see what all the hype was about. Initially I was excited thinking it would be a good workout that would enable me to stick to a cardio regime. I lift weights 3 days a week and can't stand traditional cardio.   \n\nTheir workouts which they change from one day to the next were nothing but a series of pushups, jumping jacks, squats and other basic callisthenic exercises strung together in very high volumes. The workouts are very basic and extremely repetitive. No creativity and totally lame.  The shocker was that they charge $199 a month for this. No thanks. I'd rather be doing a Beach Body program like P90X or Insanity.",

The facility on Swede Road has been a pleasant surprise - as others noted, nothing frou frou, but solid, good equipment with only minimal wait (6-7 p.m. hour can be packed). The only place you can expect to wait is the pool. It's a rare occurrence that I can go in and immediately get a lane - still trying to find the sweet spot timing for that - but people of all fitness shapes, friendly and convenient. Looks like they are starting up the juice bar again, spiffy new signs were being put up today. Good deal overall.",

I'm an unabashed fitness junkie and am here usually six days a week.  There are dozens of treadmills, bikes, and elliptical machines as well as a large free weight and machine weight area.  The machines are in good shape and are all Life Fitness, the best maker imho.  There is also a dedicated 30min circuit area as well as an ab area.\n\nNegatives?  Maybe, depending on what you're looking for.  This is not a pickup or exhibition gym, and many of the members are newbies.  Also, if you are into classes...you're outta luck, as there are none.  What you DO get is a well equipped, modern gym with all the stuff you need...for $10 a month.  Can't beat it.",

  "text": "I love this gym and the friendliness of the front desk people! My only complaints are that the computer system goes down a lot. Last week I couldn't tan 3 times because of that. Also why do the paying customers have to clean all equipment? There are usually 3 front desk people that are always either on their phones or staring at the wall. Why doesn't one of them just walk around the gym n spray down the machines after customer use? Seems a better use of their time and your money and would add to customer satisfaction. You also need small trash cans in the tanning bed rooms, you wipe the machines down n then have to chase the paper towels all over when the fans go on! Need to sell better tanning goggles also, yours dig into the eye sockets!",

  "text": "As October ends, so does the deal to visit this club at no additional fee for those of us with \"regular\" LA Fitness memberships.\n\nI took advantage of this as much as possible because I'm growing more and more tired of the Hyde Park location having no parking for its members anytime there's an event going on in the area on the weekend.\n\nThis so-called Signature Club is very nice, but I really do not understand why they charge extra to come here. There is virtually no difference between this location and at least two other clubs that I visit in Orlando which require no additional daily fee or higher priced membership. My guess is that members of this club are simply paying LA Fitness' cost from building this club (Perhaps the land/garage was a higher cost than expected) and they are passing that debt onto its members.\n\nSure, I like the over 100 cardio machines and the basketball court, but what else justifies paying a 50% higher monthly fee to go here than all the other clubs in Tampa Bay and Orlando? Sorry, choice of a clean hand or bath towel does not.\n\nOh, speaking of towels, each one is electronically monitored. Seriously, next time you walk out the exit closest to the parking garage, look up and to the right and you'll see a box mounted on the wall with a digital counter. That counter keeps a running tab of how many towels set off the alarm as they attempt to leave the building.\n\nAlso, this LA Fitness really needs to stop its members from running around the cardio equipment like it is a track. It is flat out dangerous, because somebody could step off a machine and just go right into these rubes who choose to run around equipment instead of simply going out on the streets near their homes like everyone else.\n\nAnd next time any of you Signature Club members are upstairs near the basketball court, pop your head in there and look at the big photo on the far right and tell me that doesn't look like Ashton Kutcher growing a 70's porn star mustache.",

Comfort & feeling like a part of the studio is important to me & I feel I get that here in addition to a killer workout.\n        La Belle Fit offeres a lot of classes; spin, Zumba, yoga, Pilates, suspension training or TRX and of course Barre.

No community feel, very corporate, but it is what it is, a giant fitness chain. The locker room area has always been clean in my experience, there is a sauna. Nothing feels special about this gym. Sometimes I'm greeted at the door, sometimes not. \n\nI usually work out between 5:30am and 6:30am. There are always plenty of machines. I've gone around 6pm on a weekday, busier, but still plenty of machines. I've also gone on an afternoon on a Sunday and still plenty of machines. I haven't started using their weights, those seem to be busy, but not packed. I can't really attest to how easy and quick it would be to get a full set of weights in. I think that is probably much easier early mornings. \n\nThey offer free classes with your membership, I haven't gone to any, but the spinning and Zumba classes I've walked by seem to have plenty of space for new people to join. I'll update review if I start going. \n\nI've never been a member of a HUGE gym like this, so I don't have a lot to compare to. If a better option opens up for me at the right price point I wouldn't hesitate to cancel my membership here. Location is important for my work and life schedule, so for now LA Fitness wins.
