  "text": "I played Yelp Roulette for Castleton.  They were some other options I wanted to try like burgers and BBQ, but I had that recently. #40 on the list was Joella's.  As I looked at the menu, it claimed the winning spot for my supper.\n\nJoella's is a little different from your standard fast food chicken places.  You get to choose your level of spice, more side options, and dipping sauces you do not get from other establishments. \n\nI went with the Jumbo tenders at the Ella's Fav level with red-skin mashed potatoes and green beans.  For checking in to Yelp, I also got a big wing, which I almost had to argue about receiving.  The tenders were big, juicy, and on the spicy side.  The green beans were ok but the mashed potatoes was very creamy and delicious. The wing had good flavor but has the flaws of most wings, not enough meat and some maneuvering.\n\nOne sauce comes with the meal and one sauce is just not good enough for this sauceaholic. So I chose 5 and paid an extra 50 cents for each one.  A description of the sauces I tried are: Jojo (Mustard BBQ), Bama white (a lot of horseradish), cheerwine BBQ (Cheerwine is a chery flavored soda), pimento ranchero (ranch with pimento cheese), and my favorite  - the spiked honey.  I am having a hard time thinking of a sauce similar to it.  Either way, that's the sauce I'm choosing next time then either the Jojo or Pimento Ranchero.\n\nFor dessert, they have pie in a jar.  I had the chocolate peanut butter one which was very fulfilling. I get to keep the jar too.\n\nSweet tea was Indiana level sweet tea which means barely sweet.  But it was fresh-brewed. \n\nI thought of Joella's as a better Southern Pop-eyes.  If you love fried chicken with some heat, come give it a try.",

  "text": "10 stars.\n\nLast night, I had a 5 course meal cooked by a man that is not a chef, does not own a restaurant, but cooks for the love of cooking.  I understand he cooks over at the downtown Farmers Market, now and then.\n\nHis name is Vivek.\nI'm going to go all the way out and say that his meal was by far, better than any meal I have had in any of the local restaurants..\nBetter, than any of the fancy schmancy restaurants I have eaten in..\n\nHis attention to diversity in taste, texture, flavor.. It was all there.\nFrom his salad with garbanzos and peanuts with radishes, cilantro and mint..  It took my breath away.  I have not had such a wildly diversified taste in ingredients as I did this salad. Light, tasty, my mouth exploded with flavor.  \n\nHis ribs were rubbed with zingy dry spices.. fall off the bone meaty pork ribs with such good spicy flavor.\n\nHis lamb mixed in with basmati rice.. He did not throw away the lamb drippings but incorporated them to give the rice such deep flavor..\n\nIf you are on the POP Nashville mailing list, watch for this mans name to pop up and grab a ticket.\nThis is the BEST deal in Nashville for excellent food at an excellent price.\nAbsolutely amazing..\nI cannot say enough good things about this man and his cooking AND the wonderful people who run POP Nashville.\n\nThis IS THE JEWEL of Nashville.\nAll I can say is WOW!",

  "text": "Another \"Delco Proper\" hotspot! \n\nThe restaurant is totally 70's with orange vinyl booths, faux wood linoleum, wood paneling, etc. The place reeks of smoke, and the regulars monopolize all the counter seats (and they are not friendly people). The waitstaff is normally decent; it's a diner so don't expect much. \n\nIt is crazy how this place is open 24-7 and someone is always there eating something. We once saw a family there at 4am who were talking about how they just finished driving home from a road trip vacation, and all they wanted to do was eat at Tom Jone's, and then go to bed. On Sunday after church it is crazy, and the line is out the door. When we were in our early 20's we'd often have parties and send the late-night people to Tom Jones for some food to sober up. They always loved it. There is something about the atmosphere, reminds me of \"Pulp Fiction\" somehow, in a vintage way.\n\nWhat to eat? BLUE RIBBON, Baby! Last time we bought... for $3.89 you get: 2 sausages + 2 bacon + 2 pancakes + 2 eggs + OJ + coffee + 2 slices toast !!!!\n\nIt is always done FAST and it's always decent diner quality.\n\nBrookhaven is dry so don't expect any booze here.\n\nIt sucks, but CASH ONLY!\n\nThey have a walk-up pick up window on the side, but any time we ever did pick up they never used it.\n\n(This place is so Delco, Tommy Pope's gotta know about it... hopefully we may see a rendition of it in his Comedy Central \"Delco Proper\" webisodes.)",

Their donuts melt in your mouth and are always a treat to bring into the office or for friends. I work in an office that a majority of people are not from Indianapolis, I blew their minds this morning with the donuts from Long's! I have never been when there wasn't a line, however, it moves quickly.

  "text": "Some of my new favorite pizza! The pizza has a thin crust with a bit of crisp on the outside and chewiness on the inside. The toppings are quality, plentiful, and delicious. \n\nMy favorite was the fig and pig which was a delicious combo of prosciutto, fig spread, arugula, and a balsamic glaze. The cherry picker was a delicious veggie pizza and the Tony was a plentiful meat pizza with a bit of heat to it! All were wonderful. My teenagers and my parents also loved them all. We also ordered a couple of the Magic cookies which are about hand sized and filled with ooey gooey chocolate chips and a nice sprinkling of sea salt flakes. I approve! Drooling again...\n\nThe restaurant is closed to dine-in right now so you can only do curbside pick up. Although, I can't wait to be able to try it piping hot out of the over!\nThe order process is online , and make sure you order early enough because he can only make three pizzas for every 15 min time slot. \n\nThe price is up there, but the quality and taste warrant this special treat of a pizza! Next time I want to try the cucumber margaritas too.",

  "text": "100% FRESH BEEF... Fresh Cut Fries cooked in 100% peanut oil... YummmmmY\n\nWell i finally made it. And apparently at a good time, I WAS NOT greeted with the \"line out the door\" phenomenon; thank you Jesus!!! \n\nUpon entering, its quite busy. People preparing food. People eating. People talking. People taking orders. In short, the use of your inside voice is not necessary. \n\nThere were only 2 people ahead of me, how sweet is that???? No struggle there. But here's the reason for 3 stars instead of 4... \n\nThe cashier who was \"supposed\" to be taking my order found it moooooooore interesting to talk to her fellow cashier & that cashier's patron than to take my order. So, I PATIENTLY waited for her (Maya according to the register receipt) to acknowledge me, greet me & ask me to step forward before I did so (I initially thought she was helping her fellow coworker with an problem, but as I ear hustled, I learned she was engaging in a nonchalant conversation with the 2 other ladies)... So, 2.5 minutes passed & she FINALLY acknowledged me & took my order (which, of course, not surprisingly she got WRONG). \n\nThe food was good. Temperature was great. No biting & shuffling of food in your mouth because it was too hot. I got a little cheeseburger, thanks to my neglectful cashier, \"all the way\" less pickles. Grilled onions & mushrooms made me Happppppppppppppy!!!!\n\nThe burger prices seem comparable to Wendys, the fries are a little pricey, but I skipped out on that portion of the experience.  \n\nFree roasted peanuts for your dining pleasure, but don't throw those shells on the floor, as the sign directs; this AIN'T O'Henrys (well that part isn't in the sign... I threw that in for free  ) \n\nI enjoyed my dining experience, but I failed to see what all the hype was about.  But hey, \"I came, I saw, I conquered...\"  \n\nParking is shared with other retail establishments in the strip mall area, but there's really NOT a shortage of parking spots. \n\nThe outside dining is a plus.",

  "text": "The rating I give is not for the food, but for the service and management of the establishment.\n\nI found a Groupon for Crazy Sushi (20$ for 40$ worth of food) and decided to go with a friend. I noticed it was BYO so we picked up a bottle of wine, which made us a little late for our 8:30 PM reservation. Fortunately, we were still seated relatively quickly, although our being seated was very awkward. The hostess led us to a half cleaned table and made us wait as we watched them clear it up. She also left the menus on the sushi bar which was a few feet away from our table, so when we were finally seated, we had to go grab the menus ourselves. The restaurant was pretty full, as almost every single table was seated. So perhaps service was backed up for this reason?\n\nAnyway, it was a while before anyone came by to offer us water, at which point we asked for our wine to be uncorked. They came back soon after, with our uncorked wine (sans ice bucket...) and 2 glasses of water, one of which they spilled ALL over me. My shirt, from my stomach area, down to my knees was drenched. The waiter seemed horrified, apologized, but then started tending to the water on the floor while I sat in shock, just sitting in a puddle of tap water. No help was offered to dry me off. I was not a happy camper at all. If I had not had a Groupon, I would have left immediately. I had a change of clothes in the car, which we parked just in front (lucky parking!), so it was fine. I'm not really that mad that they spilled water on me, because it gets worse.\n\nWhen I got back from my change of clothes, my seat was haphazardly dried and some napkins were left on the table. We sat, and resumed examining the menu. We asked for an ice bucket, which came pretty late. Another waitress came by soon after to apologize for the mishap, and offered us a discount. She then URGED us to order another special roll (which I was originally reluctant to do, because we had already ordered so much), and then assured us that the discount would cut down the price enough that our Groupon would be enough to cover the entire bill. I think perhaps that the services' lack of English skills may have contributed to this miscommunication, because at the end of our meal, they gave us a complimentary red bean mochi ice cream and they called THAT our 'discount'. When we received the bill, there was no actual discount.\n\nI was FURIOUS. We had ordered an extra special roll because the waitress had assured us that it would be taken care of with the discount, but found that there was no actual discount. We called a waiter to straighten out the issue, but the only excuse I got was that the machine wouldn't allow more than one discount per bill, and Groupon is apparently a discount. I'm still outraged at this. I had told them from the very beginning that I had a Groupon, yet they still assured me that they would have a discount, and then PUSHED us to order an extra roll.\n\nEven with that whole situation aside, the service is still pretty lacking. It was pretty slow and hard to communicate with. We weren't given a single waiter (instead the waiters chaotically came by without reason or rhyme to check on us), yet this restaurant seems high class enough to have a systematic waiting system.\n\n\nThe reason I didn't rate this place 1 star is the food. The 'normal' rolls were fresh, delicious. The hamachi-scallion roll was delightful and the scallion came through perfectly. There was a little too much crunch and grease for me in the cooked scallop roll, but it was still delicious. I highly recommend the Odessa roll, which is salmon wrapped around unagi, tuna, and masago. I didn't get too much of the masago, and perhaps there was a little too much eel sauce on top, but it was heavenly. The other special we ordered (that we were CONNED into ordering in my opinion) was the Long Island roll, which is eel tempura, spicy salmon wrapped with white tuna. That is the exact description of the roll on the menu, yet when it came out, it was covered in this overly sweet, sweet and sour chicken reminiscent sauce. It ruined the roll in my opinion, and had I known that the roll came in this sauce, I would not have ordered it. I would stay away from the Long Island if you actually like the taste of sushi.\n\n-------\nSorry for the wall of text! \n\nIN SHORT: If the service and management here gets a HUGE make over, this would definitely be one of my regular BYO's in the city. As is, I am hesitant to return. Perhaps I will get take out for the Odessa roll, about which I wil have dreams forever.\n\nCome here for good food and terrible service.",

  "text": "It is interesting to me that the reviews here are so mixed. Did our move go perfectly? No. What move ever does? But were we pleased and satisfied? Yes. Would we use Helping Hands again? Yes.\n\nAfter much research and reading reviews, Better Business Bureau information, etc, we booked Helping Hands to move my dad from his home to his new apartment (he is downsizing). It was complicated because he needed packing services and we had to stop not only at his new place but also a nearby storage unit. Darryl and I corresponded first here on Yelp and then later by email several times before the move. Darryl was prompt in replying and answering my questions. Then he sent us several rounds of questions about the move and the specifics of the job. In all, I thought we were pretty well aligned and that the communication was good prior to the move. Here were are pros and cons:\n\nPROS:\n-The team was supposed to show up between 8 and 11 and Darryl promised me they would try their best to be there closer to 8. They arrived around 8:45, which was fine. The team of two - Colton and Floyd - were total rock stars. They were nice, they were respectful of our stuff, they asked questions when they weren't sure, they were very careful both packing and moving my dad's items and also in carefully packing the truck first to protect the items and also to ensure that everything was packed in a way that we could unload smartly at the apartment and then the storage unit. They thought it through and executed everything really well. We also appreciated that if they found items that had previously been cracked and glued back together or a table with a wobbly leg, etc, they were sure to point that out to us so that we could agree that this damage was not incurred during the move. Also, they never got grouchy, even though the move took eight hours. Really great. My dad and my sister kept asking me where I found this great moving crew.\n-I'm happy to say that we didn't have a single item broken in the move. Very impressed. Unpacking on the other end, we were really pleasantly surprised at how carefully our items were packed. I was also impressed with the care that was taken when the items themselves were being moved. There were several items that were a close fit through the door, and Colton and Floyd really had to work hard to get some of them through.\n-Obviously, the price was good compared to some of the other estimates I got. I will say, I was surprised when they rolled up in a Penske truck instead of their own truck with their own logo. They used boxes that they were recycling from Amazon, etc. It is a bit of a budget operation. It was less professionally run than other moves we've done with the big moving companies. There were no fancy numbered stickers on all the boxes or paperwork where you check off each box coming in the door. But they got the job done and the price was excellent. We felt it was a good deal for a pretty good quality move overall.\n\nCONS:\n-Despite discussing it prior to the move, the movers did not show up with proper packaging for the mattress or with wardrobe boxes, which I specifically asked for. However, after the move, Darryl did apologize for this oversight and offered us a good faith partial refund to make it up to us as that was their fault. We appreciated that very much.\n-As we were wrapping up at the storage unit (the second stop), I asked the movers if I was supposed to write them a check or what. They said that Darryl would send me an invoice, which he did as we were standing there. That was fine by me. We parted ways and I went back to join my family. All of us were starving and we sat down to eat some pizza. In the middle of this meal, I received a call from Floyd who basically said that Daryl was waiting for me to pay the invoice. I agree with Lavanya. This was really weird. If you want immediate payment, you should just ask people to write the movers a check before they leave the job. If you're going to invoice folks, give them a day or two to pay the invoice for heaven's sake. Moving is a really busy time. Moving day is insane. I think Helping Hands could eliminate this by simply asking people to pay upon completion of the job then.\n-I will say that I felt Helping Hands could benefit from having some more professional processes in place. It is confusing to use their website -- they use a program called Calendly where you pick your date and time slot and request it. Then they email you an invoice and you pay it to lock in your date. Then you get multiple back and forth questionnaires from Darryl. The intake seems a bit disjointed and not that smooth. And I could see how it would make some people nervous.\n\nFortunately I am good with technology and was willing to take the risk and I am glad I did. Like I said -- our move wasn't perfect, but no move is. Overall we were pleased with our service and would recommend Helping Hands.",

  "text": "I've had my eye on the Mood Cafe for months. Every time I log into Yelp, there it is sitting in the top 5, eye balling me. I passed by it several times, and though that place looks interesting. After awhile, my mind starting asking, \"Why haven't you gone to Mood Cafe?\" So, I finally took these thoughts out of my mind and tried to get my wife to go. At first, she was a skeptic and did not want to go. On my third attempt, she finally gave me the why not approval.\n\nAfter going, we both should be asking, what is wrong with us. This place Amaze! It looks like a small place with not much to offer. The two main menu items are Lassis and Chaat. I've had a Lassi before, and it's always been Mango. But this place had like 25 Lassi flavors. But what is a Chaat I wondered?\n\nThe owner who was working there on our visit explained. There is so much that goes into a Chaat, he lost me somewhere along the way. But what was not lost was my intrigue. I go the Crazy Chicken Chaat. The crazy was their way of saying it's a chicken and beef combo. The beef reminded me of taco meat, but the kind that is seasoned extremely well.\n\nWatching him make the Chaat was like watching an artist. It was like Jackson Pollack at work with the piling on so much stuff. A threw a bunch of stuff down. Then he added 3-4 sauces. He threw more stuff down. Added more sauces. And then he threw more stuff down. Not sure I remember it all, but there was mango, almonds, crispy noodles, dates, potato, and, and, and... yeah that's what I remember. But I know there was more.\n\nWhen I put this goodness in my mouth, it was like a party of flavors. It tasted so fresh and nothing like anything I had tasted before. I was in love.\n\nI also had a peach Lassi which was excellent. My wife had the same dish as me, but got the blueberry Lassi. I liked her Lassi even better.\n\nI so am going back to this place. You should go too!",

As other Yelpers have stated the menu tourista is worth every penny and most of the table opted for that option. I cant remeber what everyone had just that i was happy about my entree choice of the gnocchi. They were perfect in every way.I stole a few bites of friends entrees and left feeling satisfied. The staff was really great with to our large group, we had a vegan dining with us and though i think her order was messed up they were super apologetic and fixed the mistake. The chef brought out an additional entree for one of the girls who really didn't like her goat dish, needless to say i was super impressed with the staff. Dessert was all the rage as we shared an assortment ending the night with fond memories with one of the most awesome people i've met in my life.\n\nHaving dined at one of the other sister restaurants i can say food wise this place is spot on but the atmosphere is slightly older than i would like. So its truth in what i said about Monsu being where you bring your wife and Poplino would be where you take your mistress ... MANGE",

  "text": "Had a hankering for soft Korean tofu soup.  This place was recommended to me by a friend and had good reviews on Yelp.  \n\nAmbiance: old style authentic interior with staff dressed in Korean garb.  Big tables with buzzer for instant service\n\nFood\n-Soon tofu soup: beef mushroom is good but lacks the deep savory taste I'm use to from the places I've been in Los Angeles.  The rice is cooked nicely in a stone pot and has a crispy exterior which is nice however I'm sure makes the soup pricier.\n-Kalbi: standard and good portion\n-Banchans: these are the side dishes of alfalfa sprouts, kimchi, tofu etc.  There was a nice mix and free refills which was nice.\n\nOverall this place is authentic and food tastes ok.  It's a bit on the pricier side.  It can't compare in taste to the soon tofu places in Los Angeles but I guess that's not fair as Korean population here is much smaller.   I would come back again but not often.",

  "text": "Authentic Nashville-style hot chicken in Indy! The chicken here is SO good, and they have some creative dishes like chicken and waffles and chicken sandwiches.\nI had the quarter chicken white with a waffle. The chicken is served just the way it was at the restaurants we ate at in Nashville, with a pickle slice on top and a piece of white bread to soak up all the sauce (yes, you get bread even if you ordered the waffle). The chicken was fantastic. The waffle was decent but not as good as the chicken.\nThey have lots of spice levels, including \"southern fried\" if you don't want the heat. I had the Ella's Favorite spice level (\"burst of flavor and a little heat\") which was perfect for me. As advertised, the chicken was very flavorful and had a bit of spice but didn't burn my mouth. My husband had the Tweener (\"medium heat\") level and that was noticeably hotter although still not as hot as even the \"mild\" flavor at Hattie B's in Nashville. He had his chicken in the form of the chicken and pimento cheese sandwich. I tried a bite and it was so good - next time I'm getting that. We also had sides of the mac and cheese and french fries. The mac and cheese had kind of a gummy texture but I really loved the flavor and it paired really well with the hot chicken.\nPrices are super reasonable. We had more food than we could eat and it was only $20 for the two of us. I thought the service was really friendly and the food came out super fast, despite a sign that warns you that it's made to order and will take a while. \nTwo minor, non-food related complaints: there was no soap in the women's bathroom, which is a little gross (especially if you think about the employees who have to use the bathroom and return to work) and their drink dispenser doesn't do a good job of separating the water from the fruit punches and the \"water\" comes out bright pink.",

I'm pretty sure that my late-night drunken breakfast days are behind me but this place would be a pretty good option if one of those happens along again.\n\nIt was lunch time when we arrived and I was no longer in the mood for breakfast so I went after a BLT & fries.  It was good but nothing special.  I had some serious food envy working when the couple at the table next to us received their food.  The woman's fried chicken looked like exactly what I should have ordered.  Oh well.\n\nKid 1 ordered some mega combo that included one of everything...which she couldn't finish.  I had already abandoned my fries in hopes of getting one of the three chocolate chip pancakes (they were a substitution item) she had in front of her.  She hates powdered sugar so i was offered the one on top.  It had been on the table for about 15-20 minutes at that point but it was still very good.  My suspicion is that it was flat-out amazing when originally served.  Even cold and neglected, it was still the best thing I ate there.    \n\nNext time around, I'm either ordering breakfast or fried chicken.  Maybe even chicken & waffles if it is on their menu.",

  "text": "If I give 3 smackeroos to a fast food place, I'm impressed. My daughter has been after to me to check this place out. She ate at Chipotle's a lot during her college days in S.C. where fast food is so much \"better\" than in NOLA. See Five Guys. So we met for lunch on a 90 degree day on that lovely stretch of Clearview Pkwy that was so much more scenic when it was a cow pasture, ie, Elmwood, the Concrete Jungle. She walked me through the Felipeesque process of making my \"bowl.\"  I was impressed by the fresh ingredients which is apparently the Chipotle food mission. You can make fast food that is healthy and tasty. And tasty it was. Not knock your socks off tasty, but tasty nonetheless. My \"bowl\" (which is a burrito with no tortilla) had something like brown rice (flavored with lime and cilantro), black beans, pulled pork, cheese and some sort of salsa. It was a pretty good and healthy dish and beats a double whopper with cheese on both the disgust and bloat factor. \n\nAs for the decor, I can't say I'm a fan. They are trying not to look fast food so basically have designed an interior with stainless steel bar seating which is somewhat communal, very trendy. See Mariza. It is an improvement over the orange and yellow formica at most FF places, but, frankly, I thought the tables would have been perfect for a morgue, easy to clean etc. \n\nBut regardless of the morbid decor, I will go back....and maybe get it to go.\n\nPS I'm not checking off \"Romantic\" on the additional tips section.",

  "text": "I don't know what it is about Grille 39 but I think it is one of Carmel's best kept secrets.  Since discovering it when I was pregnant nearly 6 years ago, the consistency alone in it's above average food at good prices continues to bring me back!  \n\nMy girlfriends and I used to partake in martini Mondays here...since, we go back for a glass of wine and a salad or just for dessert (the apple crisp - don't miss it).  It's always very good and the service is also excellent.  It's NEVER busy it seems, even on weekends when the Renaissance is full!\n\nMost recently, however, we ended up here again b/c my sister was turning 30 and 17 of her closest friends came into town to share a meal with her.  Unfortunately Kona and Cooper's Hawk could not accommodate us (at all or if they could, there was a room fee - silly).  Grille 39 not only had no issue accommodating in a semi-private area, they offered us a VERY affordable menu to choose from.  For $25/pp we were able to choose a three course meal off a pre-set menu.  The choices were extremely appetizing and they assured us service would be smooth and stressfree.\n\nThey were 100% correct.  Everyone seemed to devour their meals and I especially LOVED my salmon. The portions were perfect, the food was cooked well and the service ran extremely smooth.  We had two wonderful servers who filled drinks, cleaned up one of my messes (spilled water glass) and were always around to clean up plates.  It went very well!  Then dessert came out and other than the brownie, which was hard and ....tasteless, everyone seemed very happy.  I was disappointed in the brownie that I tasted off someone else's plate, but honestly that is the ONLY complaint.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this place if you have a larger group and need space, want something more private and intimate for a date night and/or a quiet place to grab a drink and have a real conversation.  It never seems crowded and there is always good food/drinks to be had. For a restaurant in a hotel, it really could not be any better!",

  "text": "My first time at Chipotle after probably a year, and it did not disappoint.\n\nFirst of all, it's very hard to mess up a veggie bowl (purely vegetarian). And if you do, you might as well throw the whole brand away. Luckily, they didn't mess up and everything was great. The only complaint I have is that it seems like the quantity has decreased. I ordered a veggie bowl yesterday for dinner - white rice, black beans, onions/green peppers, hot salsa, pico de gallo, corn, sour cream, cheese, guac, and lettuce. The price came out to $8 flat which was perfect because the last thing I wanted was a pocket full of coins. \n\nAnyways, the bowl was super tasty. I know that the quantity decreased though because I used to be able to only finish half of the bowl in one sitting - no matter how hungry I was. I could be starving or semi hungry, but I always used to eat the other half later that day or the next day for lunch.  This time, I finished literally ¾ of the bowl with maybe two scoops left. I still saved the bowl to eat the next day for lunch, but I easily could have finished it all in one sitting. I hope to back again, but just hope that it was a location issue and not all Chipotles that decreased their quantity.",

I had their yuzu shoyu -- a chicken broth base -- with shrimp. I think it would have been better with pork or chicken, though there was a lot of shrimp. And a lot of noodles and bamboo shoots along with seaweed, fish cake slices, and a half boiled egg.  I asked for added bok choy but they gave me regular cabbage instead. No problem, I like cabbage too. The bowls are large and had we not been staying at a hotel, I would have taken leftovers home. \n\nAs they'd opened during 2020 (at the beginning of the pandemic), we'd never been here before.

  "text": "At many Mexican restaurants you anticipate the moment when your food arrives with the warning, \"Be careful, it's a very hot plate.\" Then there's Taqueria La Michoacana, where everything from nachos to enchiladas is served just above room temperature.\n\nA combination of 24 hour access and affordability makes this a perfect choice for hungry party animals on an all-night bender. I'd advise choosing take-out, as the policy on bussing tables appears to be, \"wait until 80% of the tables are covered in trash before cleaning.\"\n\nThe menu includes all the usual suspects, with large screens displaying photos of available dishes. Our order arrived from the kitchen really fast. So fast, I wondered if any actual cooking had occurred in that timespan. It isn't uncommon for Mexican food to be prepared in advance, then assembled and placed in a broiler to melt the cheese and heat everything--including the plate--to piping hot perfection. But based on our experience, it's more likely a microwave oven was involved.\n\nOur shared plate of carnitas nachos featured round--clearly store-bought--tortilla chips covered with an ample supply of tasty pork, sour cream, pico de gallo, and room-temperature nacho cheese that must have been poured straight from a can. The flavors were actually quite good--we ate the whole thing--but I can't recall ever being served cold nachos. It was essentially a dressed-up version of 7-11 chips and cheese, sans the heat of a convenience store cheese dispenser ($5.95).\n\nDespite my best instincts, I ordered chiles relleno with sauce on the side to see if the poblanos were fried crispy before being soaked. The result was just as mushy as most I've seen in town, further confirming my suspicion that the chiles are being fried and refrigerated in advance, then microwaved and dunked in sauce to hide the crime. Extra disappointing in this instance, being the sauce was not your average mess of tomato puree. It was smooth, spicy, full of onion and good enough to make me enjoy the dish despite the lack of fresh-fried texture ($6.99).\n\nThe chicken in my wife's enchiladas was very dry, and the fact the topping of shredded cheese went from melty on the plate's outside edge, to completely unmelted in the center, only furthered my suspicions on the use of high-frequency radio waves as a heat source ($6.99). On both dinner plates the rice and beans were par for the course.\n\nKeeping the urgent care number on speed dial, I went ahead and tried a room-temp ceviche tostada ($2.49). Despite my concerns, the fish appeared to be reasonably fresh and was combined with a great mix of veg and plenty of cilantro. Actually quite good. Sadly, the cabeza sope I ordered was so gnarly I couldn't finish it ($1.99). Piled high with lettuce, cheese, and meat, it looked promising on the plate. But the thick-fried masa was very difficult to bite through, possessing mostly the flavor of old, burned oil. \n\nSimilarly, an order of tacos al pastor tasted overcooked and a tad burned ($1.25 each), with tiny pebbles of meat that--though still edible--didn't have a hint of spice or pineapple. \n\nPerhaps the most successful dish was caldo camaron, a soup of shrimp and vegetables ($9.49). The shrimp wasn't overcooked, and the broth was spicy without being overbearing. Oddly, the veggies were cut in very large pieces, with carrots and squash the length of my fingers, and several whole red potatoes. Odd, but not a deal breaker. The soup wasn't served as hot as I'd like, but it was the warmest dish we were served.",

I'm always a little skeptical of Chinese places just because you always hear horror stories of people getting sick off Chinese food, \"they use dog meat\", etc. I decided to risk it and called to place my order. \n\nThe lady who answered the phone was nice and pretty easy to understand. Delivery took 50 minutes which I thought was a little long considering this place is only 5 minutes up the street. I ordered a small chicken lo mein, a small wonton soup, and a combo dinner of sweet and sour chicken that came with pork fried rice and an eggroll. I ordered a lot on purpose to meet the $10 min order delivery requirement and to be able to eat on it for a few days. It ended up making 4 meals. Everything was good with the soup and lo mein being the 2 standouts. Was it the best Chinese food ever? No. Was it good enough that I may order it again in 5 years? Sure. \n\n*Oh, and I never got sick or suspected dog meat was used. So that's good.",

  "text": "February 12, 2012 Sunday - dinner 6:15 PM\n2 adults & a kid\n\nAtmosphere - 4 stars\nFood - 4 stars\nService - 5 stars\n\nBackground - Yep another one of those online deals.  If you are already planning on going or want to try a new place what a great way to save some money.  I would love to hit at every pizza joint in town.  I know it will take a long time, but I like this idea more I think about it.\n\nAtmosphere - Wow the first this I noticed was an old clay pigeon hunting game on the wall.  Wow that just brought back a bunch of memories.  The place is fairly good size and the bar was off by itself.  I even played a game of air hockey with my daughter after dinner; I did not let her win.  They had a variety of tables including several larger tables that had large picnic style benches, great for big groups and kids.  The menu board left of the register does not give much detail on what the specialty pizzas are other than name.  They had a lamented colored menu next to register that gave that kind of detailed information.  So if there is no line, just skip that big board and go for that hand held menu.\n\nFood\n  Appetizer - They do have a small salad bar but none for me today.\n\n  Main Course - We went with a large 15\" half Boulevard Combo and half cheese.  They paged us overhead when the pizza was done.  The have a huge knife, to cut the pizza, maybe not large enough for that 15\" pizza as one section did not have the crust cut.  The only thing was wrong with the pizza this night.  I love the sausage with that pizza.  The sauce was not over powering, and just the right amount under the cheese.  I might want to try just a sausage pizza as eating them by themselves of the pizza sheet was yummy.  The crust was thinker but still nice and crisp, a nice combination.\n\n  Dessert - I admit it I ate too much pizza. \n\nService - Very friendly service and no attitude about having the LivingSocial deal.  He had no issues handling it that coupon.  It almost paid for the three of us completely.\n\nFuture - Yeah if I am in this area I will go back for more.",

It seemed to be filled with a lot of regular items, which is fine for a grocery I guess. But with higher prices, I'd expect a wider array of higher quality goods to match the price.

  "text": "I used to love Tiffin, and then my husband and I ate in and were served frozen samosa appetizers, when we questioned it we were met with almost no remorse and just general bad service, so we stopped eating there. Fast forward to the new menu offerings... \n\nIt was like deja vu. The new Indo-Chinese menu was perfection the first time I ordered. Or, well so I thought. Turns out they messed up the order and gave us the manchurian sauce with the paneer and the garlic sauce with the cauliflower. So the next time we ordered the garlic sauce/paneer combo we were not happy to see the oily weird sauce that had been with our cauliflower. MInd you this sauce is marked as \"hot\" on the menu. Nothing remotely hot about it. \n\nI was also super bummed to see that the green curry was WHITE, unlike the last time I ordered it when it was actually green and lit my mouth up in the most delicious way. This order was just bland and practically curry free.There was also something off about the Malai Kofta. \n\nThe food was so awful that I actually took it back to the restaurant (we'd picked it up) and asked for my money back. After standing there for fifteen minutes they finally acknowledged me. When I explained that the curry was non-existant, the garlic sauce  mishap and the eh Malai Kofta they focused on the Malai Kofta and asked their chef to taste it, then told me it was fine. Ok, great what about the white curry sauce? No acknowledgement, the mixup on the sauces the first time that led us to believe we were ordering one thing and not the other. Whatever. We placed an order at Ekta while waiting for the refund. Too bad, because when Tiffin is good they are amazing, but when they are bad they are beyond terrible. I won't be back, not worth the risk.",

As we waited, we grabbed some drinks at the bar. The food came out and man did I wish I hadn't eaten so much earlier! Such a good sandwich with a thick cut of meat and the sauce was perfection for not being too sweet. The other toppings give the sandwich a crunchy texture. I would definitely eat more if I could!",

  "text": "In town for a weekend getaway and having no knowledge of the local food scene, I came across Mood Cafe while searching. Good reviews, excellent photos and decent prices brought me in, and I couldn't have been happier with my choice. Thank you again, Yelp, for steering me to such a great find in the city of brotherly love.\n\nMood Café had some seriously high reviews.. a solid 5 star rating with close to 250 reviews, so they've got to be doing something right. They serve a dish called Chaat here.. something I've never heard of and something that I figured I might as well try. \n\nThis place is much smaller than I expected. No real sitting area, but they have a couple of makeshift tables and plastic stools for people who want to eat there. Plastic forks, knives and napkins sit by the door as a \"grab your own\" kind of thing. You place your order at the counter and they prepare it in plastic to go containers.\n\nHaving no clue what I wanted, I told the guy behind the counter that I was in town for the night, saw they had some great reviews on Yelp, and I wanted to see what it was all about. He explained one of the menus was yogurt based smoothies and the other was the chaat. He also helped steer me by asking if I wanted vegetarian or the type of protein I wanted. \n\nI think I should point out that I had no clue what chaat was and really still don't. I know it has a lot of tasty sauces.. some crunchy bits and fresh mango in it. Mine had the Chicken Tikka in it too, because that's what I ordered. There were some items in my dish that were cold and some that were hot. Some bits were crunchy and some bits were not. While I cannot tell you exactly what it was (or if it was authentic like some reviews claim it is not) I can tell you it was delicious and I ate every bite of it.\n\nI also ordered the blueberry lassi and was really happy with it. A friend ordered the mango and we were each given a full glass of what we ordered and a smaller cup with the other one so we could taste it. I thought this was a really nice gesture and was very appreciative of it.\n\nI'd love to tell all of my friends about Mood Café and haul them all to Philly to give it a try, but there wouldn't be enough room in the place for everyone. Instead, I can only share my experience and hope it steers you inside on some cold and rainy night as it did me.",

It was pretty good, though I think it would have been better with Hendrick's over Bombay and if there was a bit less simple syrup.  I think the other one that I tried was the Irish Jolly (Jameson, Snap ginger liqueur, fresh black berries, lime, ginger ale).  It wasn't my favorite, I don't think I liked the Snap liqueur). \n\nA pretty good list of beers available.  The couple that I tried I enjoyed more than the cocktails.  A long and interesting list of whiskey.  I think next time I will be just sticking to whiskey or rye with ice.  \n\nI like the vibe here, it seemed to be busy, bustling, without being over crowded.",

There's no doubt this is a very popular restaurant and we were excited for our first meal in town. \n\nAfter talking to a few folks in line, browsing Yelp pictures and perusing the menu, we opted to get the seafood and chicken andouille gumbo (award winning) plus an order of Jambalaya. \n\nWe were seated by a window, which offered us a good opportunity for people watching. Service was quick - water, bread and refills were offered in no time. \n\nThe gumbo itself wasn't what it was hyped up to be. In my opinion, the gumbo felt watered down, greasy and felt like there weren't enough chunks of meat. The seafood one was pretty bland and didn't feel special at all. The andouille gumbo offered a bit of spice and better texture... but wasn't enough to blow my mind. \n\nThe Jambalaya wasn't that great as well. The rice felt like it had been cooking a tad too long and had an overcooked feel to it. There wasn't much meat in it either and it honestly just felt like I was served a few scoops of rice. \n\nAll in all, not the best meal we had in New Orleans.

But the service stays always super friendly no matter how many people are trying to crowd into its small space.\n\nThe tortas here are in my opinion the best in Philadelphia.

I spent almost $15 just on a burger n fries, at a fast food spot. To me that's a lot, like I could've went to a sit down restaurant, at those prices. Anyways, my burger was just so so, as were the fries. I didn't even finish the fries, that's so unlike me, I love fresh cut fries! So I proably won't be returning to a Five Guys anytime soon, I will just go to steak n shake instead, prices are more reasonable, and burgers are always fresh.",

More recently, I have enjoyed the bucket of pumpkin beers for $16. Food-wise, I have had their mussels, truffle fries, tuna melt, ceviche (not a favorite), kale salad with fried egg (not a favorite) and fried calamari. They have a happy hour but you must sit in the bar. I seriously hate when restaurants do that. I found out recently, they deliver too, which is a pretty cool service.",

  "text": "I came here with a group of friends a few months ago for the first time and I wished they have locations open here in NYC. A decent steak dinner in NYC can easily cost you about $100-200, but I was pleasantly surprised at how cheap the steaks here were for the quality that my party and I received. \n\nI've never been to a Texas Roadhouse before and was looking forward to trying out their offerings. Like 5 Guys, this place offers complimentary peanuts to munch on in the waiting area as you sit and wait for your table to be ready. But before you do that, if you're here to feast on the steaks, you can pick out your steak cuts of your choice from the glass display fridge.The prices and weight of the steak are listed, so that makes it that much easier to make your choices. The butcher will then give you a ticket, which you will then give to your server and tell them how you would like your steak done. \n\nThe ribeye and sirloin were the most popular cuts of steak, so I went ahead and settled for 20-ouncer done medium-rare. We also went ahead and ordered numerous appetizers such as the fried pickles, cactus blossom and potato wedges with cheese and bacon bits. The cactus blossom was interesting and had a nice crunch to it and went well with the dipping sauce that they provided. My steak was seasoned well and went well with their signature steak sauce. \n\nOverall, I had a wonderful first experience here at Texas Roadhouse. The service was impeccable and the food got my party and I more than satisfied. I will definitely be dining at Texas Roadhouse again in the near future! $40 per person for a decent steak dinner along with drinks and appetizers is extremely economically friendly.",

  "text": "Definitely a nice Texas meat place. \n\nFirst off, the service here was amazing. Everyone was very friendly, knowledgeable and cheerful. The rolls they bake fresh are very delicious (although I didn't particularly care for the cinnamon flavored butter). They also have roasted peanuts at every table (and also two very large barrel-fulls of the roasted peanuts at the entrance/waiting area). My parents really loved the peanuts and couldn't stop eating them.\n\nThe price was really quite reasonable since most of the dishes come with two sides. We ordered a full rack of ribs and side orders of mashed potatoes and steak fries.  The ribs were literally falling-off-the-bone  delicious. The flavor and texture of the meat and BBQ sauce was among the best I've had in a while. The quantity of the mashed potatoes was a bit disappointing since the size was the equivalent of a large spoonful in a small dish. Also, the steak fries were only average, although they were well seasoned. It would have been much better if it little was a little more crispy on the outside. \n\nWe also ordered the grilled salmon with a side of Caesar salad and a sweet potato. The salad was very fresh and well flavored. The croutons were super yummy, although it didn't feel like they gave us enough (either that or they were just that good). The sweet potato was also very well steamed and flavorful. The only complaint is that the salmon smelled... well... fishy (not in a good way). The taste was also a little off... and definitely did not mix well with the ribs. We ended up eating only a few bits of the salmon, and thought we'd let the manager know about the potential problem with the freshness of the fish.\n\nWe asked the server if we could speak to the manager (and she immediately went to get him for us). We explained the problem and the manager immediately offered to get us another dish or to take the grilled salmon off our bill. I was very impressed with the professionalism of his manner and actions and would definitely go back (although I would probably still avoid ordering the salmon).\n\nI strongly recommend going to this place for the ribs (and the freshly cut steaks seemed yummy too!).",

  "text": "I REALLY wanted to LOVE this place.   I go to Finis Landing quite a bit, and I was so looking forward to visiting the spin off.  I stopped in to have a beer and grab some food and catch the vibe. It was about 430pm on Monday, and there was a big table behind me,  and a few people at the bar.   \nI was hoping for a couple Mexican beers on draft, as I saw them in prior reviews.    They only had Dos Equis Amber on draft.    I had one and switched to Pacifico bottle.....( happy hour bottles were 5 dollars).\nI noticed several kitchen staff sitting outside of the kitchen chatting with the bar tender.   There was a  friendly cook/manager?? who  walked around talking to the large table behind me, as well as the table on the perimeter.  I heard him introduce himself, and say he checks up on people to make sure they have a good experience.     He brought the perimeter table  several dishes....and I could not find them on the menu.   Still undeterred, I really wanted to try several things on the menu.    I love burgers, and I was intrigued by the \"burger of the week\".  \n\n I asked and the kind bartender what the burger was....she grabbed a small notepad  where the description was ...and told me...\" it has green chiles on it and it sounds delicious\".    I love green chiles....so I said I am in.    I asked for it to be medium rare.....and that part was excellent.  \n \nIt said \"market price\"....but I am figuring hey.... Its a hamburger.. how expensive can it be? \n\nIt was $18.00!!....for a burger and fries. \n\n When I opened the to go container....it looked...(well.. see picture).   It was salty, and the bun was super hard.     I was so sad.....I mean seriously sad. \n\nThe avocado tacos were good...but literally they used a quarter of an avocado per taco, put some stuff on it and ...boom.   I ordered corn tortillas, the tacos came out on flour tortillas.    Two tacos and beans...$12.00.  \n\nSO here is my take.   I understand they are new, and training staff, etc.   However clear prices and better descriptions of each item would be most excellent.    Also, if you are walking around greeting customers and asking how things are going, don't over look the single people who sit at the bar and tables.  EVERY CUSTOMER matters.   \n The prices are high based on Tucson, and if you are asking $18.00 for \"the burger of the week\"....a better description of what you are getting other  than a note pad is warranted, and it should be presented looking better than what I got. \n\nI may try this place again, but no time soon.",

I'm not sure if it's always like this or just because I went on a Monday evening when the Bucs would be playing later and they had a $5 burger special. It was a packed house.  It was headache-inducing. Aside from that, the burger took 25 minutes but it was good, not great (seemed like it was a frozen patty), my glass was empty for about 20 minutes and the waiter never gave me the mayo for my burger (after he asked me if I wanted it). I finally got a refill from the bartender when I was just about finished with my burger.  The server was too busy doing random things like changing TV stations and vacuuming the floor rather than putting ready orders on the tables and checking up on customers. When I got my check from the bartender, she ran off before I could tell her I needed a pen to sign it so I had to look for one. I couldn't wait to get out of there.

I did enjoy my Philly Love cocktail with vodka, and passionfruit served up in a Champagne flute. Im always slightly annoyed with a bubble-less cocktail comes this way ( presentation is everything). One person ordered food and seemed to enjoy it I would come back its been scratched off the list, but i would recommend it to out of town guests who we're staying near the Lowes.",

  "text": "Great place to stop for some good food, good beer, and good conversation.\n\nI have to echo what my friend, Kristi S., wrote in her review. I completely agree that I'm open to giving this place five stars because I have the feeling this place will wow me. Maybe one day I'll look back at this review and think, I was an idiot, but my visit here was a solid four stars, which still makes me a fan!\n\nIt was a 30 minute wait for indoor seating on a Saturday night. They definitely double downed on the outside seating, since I would say the size of the indoor seating is the same as the size of the outdoor. I have a huge fear of mosquitos (hey we live in Florida!) so the day I decide I'm ok with getting Zika is the day I'll sit outside in the summer. (If I know I will have to sit outside I will bathe in bug spray and everyone dining with me has to deal with the smell.) Luckily, there is a long communal table that is first come first serve, so I didn't have to sit outside (which is also first come first serve) or wait the thirty minutes. \n\nMy friend and I both went with the flight of four beers, deciding to share. This means we got to try a total of eight beers. We're dark beer drinkers, so this means we tried every porter/stout/brown ale they had on their menu (and then had to pull a couple non-dark beers to hit our eight). Honestly, I enjoyed them all. Some of the beers are seasonal and tbh, when I do beer flights unless the beer name is written down in front of me, I can't keep them straight. You'll have to come and try them yourself.\n\nI got the Beer B Q Turkey Burger. Maybe this is my fault, since it is in the name, but I wasn't a fan of the beer b q sauce. I found it overwhelming. It also came with fried jalapenos which I picked out (I am not a spice person). The bun was perfectly buttered. I honestly planned to just pick at the bun, but I ate the whole thing! If you're on a diet and think you have willpower, you're wrong and should just order it without the bun. I got the cheesy mashed potatoes as my side and man they were cheesy! I loved it. \n\nI had serious food envy as I watched other plates pass by me. The calzones were ginormous! Seriously, that could feed a family. The pretzels looked huge as well! That's an entree size and then some. They don't skimp on portions here.\n\nI definitely enjoyed this place. I'm a fan!",

This was my first time here since they expanded the space, so everything looks new, bright and clean!  And they have tons of TVs, and not all broadcasting the same thing. Staff was very attentive, and the happy hour drink specials featured beer, wine and cocktails!

I visited Trenasse for a group brunch on a Saturday afternoon. Our server was excellent! I ordered the Boudin Hash and Eggs. When it arrived, it was visually appealing. The hash had good flavor, but they were super stingy with the potatoes. It was also just barely warm. My syrup was the hottest thing on my plate. The eggs were bland even with the cheese added. The bacon was delicious. The menu said it was sweet bacon, but it tasted more like a peppery bacon. Either way, I loved it! The biscuit was weird. It had the potential to be good, but was a bit too salty and the bottom half was dry. Overall, it was a decent breakfast and I would probably get it again.",

  "text": "We were a party of 4 stopping in for dinner during a day in Santa Barbara. The atmosphere was a bit strange, as we first noticed the outdoor patio area, which had a nicely dressed young lady playing classical piano. The inside also looked elegant. But then there were large TV's everywhere with sports on. It was as if a sports bar and a fine dining restaurant had a baby - but a strange one.\n\nThe staff, although friendly, seemed very young, unprofessional, and poorly trained. They were good kids, just didn't really fit the establishment. For instance, when someone in our party asked about the fish of the day, the server told us it was an Atlantic Sea Bass - which we ordered. We waited a while for our food, and about the time I was expecting it would be coming out, the server returned only to tell us that the fish of the day was actually a Cod. What? It was strange that A) he didn't know the fish of the day, B) he waited so long to tell us there was a mistake, and C) he didn't apologize for the error. Something else was ordered in its place, but it was then delivered later than the other entrees which came out. It was poor execution. Also, when we initially sat down and were poured waters, the water was warm - no even room temperature, but actually warm. When they refilled them, it was cold water with ice in it, but it seems like the initial pitcher must have been sitting out for a long time.\n\nI had ordered the salmon salad, which was much smaller than what I had imagined an entree salad to be. The salmon was mediocre, and the small salad was missing one of the key ingredients the menu mentioned it included. I'm not sure if they were just out of the ingredient and they didn't want to tell me, or if it was just another mistake. The food was definitely overpriced for what it was.\n\nIn conclusion, the restaurant seemed confused on whether they were a classical piano playing fine dining restaurant or a sports bar. The staff was nice, but very young and seemingly very inexperienced. The food is nothing special and portion sizes are small and lacking quality. There are plenty of dining establishments in Santa Barbara, and I would recommend going elsewhere.",

I was lucky to try some of their off-menu creations at this event.\n\nI finally made it to their location recently and it met my expectations and then some. To start with, parking was very easy as I was able to find a spot right in front of the house-looking restaurant.  I made a reservation for three. We started with 18 oysters and cocktails. The oysters were very fresh, delicious, and without rocks or sand.  The strawberry sauce was a delight and it was my first time having such a sauce with oysters.  The sangria cocktail had a bit too much for my liking, but the cavan mule  I had next made up for that.  For the main course, I had the tacos, which were light and scrumptious.  There were four tortillas, nicely seasoned chorizo, and guacamole rice with sides of sour cream and green sauce. Next time I would have ordered something more like the burger since I was not too full after my taco brunch entree. Service is great and attentive and the place is noisy, so be prepared for that. You will also see people nstagramming and taking pictures in front of Cavan and inside.  \n\nI'll be back!",

  "text": "Of the 4 family-owned Thai restaurants in this 4-block span of the U. City Loop, Thai Country Cafe is my favorite.  The menu doesn't really vary much from Thai Cafe or Thai Gai-Yang, but the execution, I think, is above the rest.\n\nThis was the place that I discovered my love of Thai food, so I try to come back whenever I'm back in St. Louis for a visit.  The prices are so cheap, it makes me do a double-take every time.\n\nI always go for the Thai egg rolls and the corn cakes as appetizers.  They can't be beat.  And the pad thai here is probably the best I've ever had.  And it's the standard that I compare all other pad thai to whenever I have it around the country.\n\nThe only time I've ever had to wait for a table was when a whole dorm of Wash U freshman decided they all wanted to eat Thai food.  Aside from that, there's always room at Thai Country Cafe.  I've turned a bunch of friends on to the delicious food that it brings & they drive in from West County to eat here.  And it's definitely worth it!",

It has a quite nice dining area with lots of booths.\n\nI ordered the Big Italian 8\" with chips and a small soda.  The sandwich was just awesome! (see pics)  It had more than an ample amount of meat and cheese.  I got it on their regular bread which was great.  Their chips were OK.  They have an all-you-can-drink soda dispenser.

I am definitely going back there real soon!",

Yeah, we arrived at 9:15 and even though the doors were locked, we finagled our way inside because the sign out front said they closed at 10pm and Yelp said 10pm but a smile and a \"Please\" and we were shown to a table.\n\nWe'd already had a huge dinner and really, we just wanted this famous dessert at the place that invented it. So that's what we did.\n\nBrittney took our orders, brought over the cart, and whipped up a pair of fresh Bananas Foster. As she did so, she told us the story of the restaurant and the provenance of this particular dessert. It was interesting and fun and even though I have no doubt that she's told the story a million times, it was fresh and fun.\n\nAs for the dessert? It was excellent and delicious and SWEET. This is about as \"not keto\" as you can get and I enjoyed every single bite.\n\n[Review 14062 overall, 1384 of 2020, number 6 in Louisiana.]",

We really had gone out for breakfast, but by the time we lobbed at Trenasse, it was lunchtime.\n\nMy wife ordered boudin balls and a shrimp salad. Both were excellent. I ordered crab bisque and a po'boy. The latter was very good, the former, the crab bisque, was well past it's use by date. It had to be returned and left me with a bit of a stomach problem for the rest of the day. It was replaced by a quite nice bowl of gumbo.\n\nI would say Trenasse would normally have been worth four or five stars, but serving me with last week's crab soup is unforgiveable, and I am reviewing my experience on the day, not expectations.\n\nI reiterate the wait staff were the best I have experienced in New Orleans and one of the two who served us so very well, should walk slowly into the kitchen, look the chef squarely in the eye, then kick him in the nuts as hard as she possibly can. Y'all cain't fail so badly and expect anything else from those who should be supporting you.",

When you arrive, it appears that this place is a fast food joint.  Don't let the looks deceive you.  Everything is cooked to order here.  Therefore, it does take some time for your order to come out.  Be patient, my friend.  It will be worth it.\n\nWhen our order arrived (they bring it to your table), I could see that this was going to be good.  The waffles were just a tad bit dense, which I believe is a perfect attribute to a good Belgian waffle.  I opted to get the maple syrup (there was another choice, I just forget what it was).  I poured it all over my waffles, and what I didn't use on them I dipped my chicken in.\n\nSpeaking of that chicken, wow.  I got it without hotness (I am hot enough on my own!).  Like I said earlier, it was tender, moist, and lightly-breaded.  I was glad I went with the tenders rather than getting a bone-in piece of chicken.  I liked the fact that I had a nice, dippable product for my maple syrup.\n\nEven though this is a pretty hands-off restaurant as far as the employees go, we were still asked how our meal was by one of the managers, and all of the employees we encountered were friendly.  They seemed to enjoy working there.  That's always a bonus.\n\nCome try this place.  You won't be sorry!",

  "text": "3.5 stars.\n\nSo the quest to find good KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) continues...\n\nThis establishment is split into two: a sit-down Korean restaurant and a bar/karaoke place. I ordered the KFC at the bar for take out- it is $20 for 20 wings, and $27 for 30 wings. There are 3 kinds: plain fried, spicy marinade, and soy marinade, and our family opted for the spicy. They also have whole fried chickens.\n\nThe wings were of decent size, and the marinade was good, though not as spicy as I would've liked. Seems like the standard for KFC is Soho, and Koko's wings have a nice marinade, but lacks the all-around crunchy layer on the outside. It comes pretty close, though. The deal is better here: $27 for 30 wings of larger size. The pickled radishes are crunchy, but a tad on the vinegary side (I think I tasted come celery in there as well).\n\nOne of my biggest pet peeves: when I smell cigarette smoke inside an establishment.

  "text": "Well, I gotta do it now.  I gotta dock a star. \n\nYou see, the definition of two stars in Yelp is \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" \n\nAt first, I really thought this place had a shot to win us over.  I liked my first visit there two days into it being opened.  I really did.  \n\nI've been back twice since then.  Both times, I've been let down a bit.  \n\nThe first time back, I was with a group of 8 people.  And the general consensus that night was a big \"Meh.\"  \n\nI went back again last night.  And I'm just noticing that there are certain dishes that just aren't tasting right.  \n\nFor instance, the sushi really isn't supposed to taste a little bit fishy.  Yesterday, that's what I was getting.  It was subpar.  \n\nThere are still some scattered good dishes.  Last night, they had some Korean style steak that wasn't too bad.  But I came to get a cheap sushi fix mainly, and that's exactly what I got.  Cheap sushi.  \n\nGranted, what are you supposed to expect from the sushi at places like this?  Well, I can now say that places like Sun Buffet do this better.  And it's as simple as getting some decent sushi grade fish.  I'm getting the feeling after two straight trips here to Ichiban that's not happening here, at least not consistently.  \n\nThe first time I had sushi here, it was fine.  Granted, that was the second day, and I'm sure everything was fresh on the second day.  Inconsistency seems to be slipping in now, and if there is one area you don't want to be inconsistent in, it's the sushi.  \n\nThis isn't just the sushi.  Several of the Chinese dishes served just seem to be off on the flavoring.  Plus, my wife had the macaroni and cheese and hated it.  I tasted it, and... well, let's just say that I can't believe they screwed up macaroni and cheese.  Zero flavor.  \n\nI try not to be this harsh in my reviews.  But Ichiban... you gotta do better than this.  Really, you're screwing up some of the basics.  \n\nI've definitely experienced better Chinese buffets.",

The outcome is always yummy but I can't help but wonder if their food counter looks like that when the health inspector comes through. \n\nEvery time..., I repeat, every time I come in the whole counter where the cheese, lettuce, meats, etc is horrendous! The toppings are mixed in with other toppings, serving dishes are stacked everywhere, not in the ice, and most recently the young gentleman at the grill was literally throwing my food on the grill and in the tin like he was angry. He was put out / or just carelessly over. I can maybe see this behavior if the line is out the door but I was the only person in line. \n\nOnce my tacos were thrown into a tin I had to wait at the register while five teens got done goofing off. They didn't even see me... right there..., three feet from their face. \n\nAnother strange thing, there were like 15 employees just goofing off. I swear employees outnumbered guests. The most amazing thing is even with 15 teeny boppers working, all areas were still in chaos and unstocked. The specialty drinks were clearly tapped out, crap was all over the drink section, the hot sauces were grossly messy, the tables were grimey, and the tray/trash section was horrendous.\n\nI literally think there were 10 health code violations just from the perspective of being a customer, makes me nervous what is happening behind the counter. Their food is always delicious but the overshadow of food poising rang so loudly in my head this time around, I can't bring myself to eat at this location again. I hope I can give another franchise a chance after this experience.\n\nGross!",

  "text": "I noticed this place the first time I went all the way up to this area to check out Cafe Soho as it's only about a minute away from it.  I love tofu and Korean food, and after reading the good Yelp reviews, I knew it was a place I had to check out especially now with Miga in downtown Philly being closed.  \n\nThe decor is all wooden and what I assume is old traditional Korean style.  We were seated immediately and given menus.  In less than a minute we were brought a pitcher of water and the waiter was ready to take our order.  However, I wasn't that familiar with the menu, so we weren't ready yet.  I decided on the pa-jun (Korean pancake), that I seem to order at every Korean restaurant I go to because I like it so much, and an order of the vegetarian mushroom soft tofu stew.  The waiter asked us if we were sure we didn't want seafood and not the vegetarian pajun.  I will eat seafood, but I'm not too fond of the octopus and squid that usually end up in Korean food.  I told him I preferred the vegetable one.\n\nAbout 6 Banchan (Korean side dishes) were brought out including:  Kimchi, beansprout salad, seaweed salad, and a few other things that I'm not sure exactly what they were.  They were okay, but I've had better at other places. We were also brought a raw egg, which I assumed was for our stew.   Our food came out within five minutes, and then the waiter was never to be seen again until we flagged him down for a check.  \n\nThe pajun was okay, but only had scallions in it.  At other restaurants when I order the vegetarian one, other veggies like kimchi, peppers, mushrooms, or carrots are usually included as well, so that was a bit disappointing.  The tofu stew was good and boiling hot in temperature and spice, but I didn't think it was superior to ones at other restaurants.  I did like the rice in the stone bowl, but it was really hard to get it off the sides and no one came around and poured the warm water/tea in our stone bowl at the end of the meal like others had written about.  We also were not instructed what to do with the egg (I wasn't sure if it was for the rice in the stone bowl or the stew), and the server dropped off the food so quickly and ran off that I couldn't even ask.  I wasn't getting any 3G on my phone, so I couldn't check back here on Yelp, so I guessed and put it in the stew.  It tasted good though.\n\nThe best part of the meal was the low price.  We only paid a little over $20 for the whole meal for the two of us and we left feeling full.  I would go back if I was in the area for the stew again, but I don't think I'm going to drive out of the way for it since the service was a little lackluster and I can get similar dishes at other places.",

And if you read my reviews you know that I love to try new places. \n\nWe had no problems finding it. It is in a plaza on Bay to Bay. It is the same plaza that Feet First (running store), Pilot Bank, Massage Studio, Starbucks, Soleil Tanning, and Taco Fusion are all in. \n\nWhen we arrived we were able to park right up front. They have some spots reserved just for Kelp customers. We were also pretty happy to see the outdoor seating because it was a gorgeous day out. A couple actually had their puppy with them at their table outside :) Note that there is also indoor seating. It's a small place and I'm not sure how busy they get but between the indoor and outdoor seating, you should be good.\n\nTheir lunch options are great. For $12 you get 2 full rolls, a miso soup and a ginger salad. I went with that option. My friend got 2 rolls (see my pictures) and she really enjoyed them both. And their lunch, all the way until 4pm!\n\nService was very nice. Everyone was very friendly. They were attentive and the service was nice and fast.\n\nBasically, I'll be back for more :)",

  "text": "I haven't really gotten into ramen. I know, I know. \n\nBut I also stalk Mike Solomonov's favorite places and Neighborhood Ramen was one of them. So after a not so fun comedy show last night, this was a top choice at 10 PM. \n\nThe first lady at the counter seemed super disinterested for some reason and after taking the order of the person in front of me (we were the only two parties at that moment), went to one of the tables and started having her meal. No eye contact, no verbal communication. Maybe she was having a bad day. Or maybe...\n\nAnother lady came out from the back, the polar opposite of Lady One. Super friendly, welcomed me on my first time there and was super sweet throughout. She even got us chopsticks/forks/bowls despite this being a mostly self-service restaurant . Thank you for making up for Lady One's coldness. \n\nShe started us off with complimentary marinated spicy cucumbers, which were delicious and had a little kick. We ordered gyoza - their take ontheir was super interesting. Pan fried with a lot of filling, and served in tangy liquid (vinegar?) which was delicious compared to their commonly dry counterparts.\n\nThe Tantan seemed like the most popular choice and the two of us ordered one, extra spicy (which is an additional $1). It was kind of like their take on the Dan Dan noodles which I love. The sesame paste made it a thicker broth which we lapped up ravenously. The (miso?) marinated egg was boiled to perfection, with a soft yet firm yolk that we were a little sad to have to share. Definitely a hearty portion. \n\nDefinitely see myself returning here, especially for late night cravings (open till midnight).",

There were still a few stragglers from lunch - the vibe is dark and soothing, gentle Moby tracks were wafting and the lighting low.  Service prompt and attentive, panko fried avocado appy was delicious with hot mayo.  The Wasabi roll was beautifully presented and tasty but devoid of wasabi, no matter plenty to dip into on the other plates.  The Maguro and Saba were both delicious and generously cut.  A ginger Martini thingy was quite lovely.  We split all this for $55, it seemed a little pricey and it is far from home but definitely A-OK.  Private rooms and hibachi tables available.",

  "text": "This charming, traditionally decorated restaurant gets crowded, so arrive before or after the main dinner rush to take advantage of their parking lot. Pressing a red button on the table calls service. English isn't a strong point for some staff, but luckily for us, a friend spoke Korean and was able to communicate our complicated requests.\n\nThe kimchi version of their famous soon du bu ($9; soft tofu soup with beef and spiced cabbage) was damn good, sporting a decent kick and vibrant flavors. Served in a stone bowl with rice on the side, I cooked a raw egg in the light, but filling, soup to add texture. The kitchen go all out with the spices (I requested mine \"Very Spicy\"), but it was SO good I didn't care. (Next to me, my friend was dying - she can handle hot food, so maybe our bowls were switched?) Of the banchan, the cucumbers were a winner.\n\nJong Ja Jip has been recommended to me time and time again and I finally tasted firsthand why. It's an excellent value: our group of ten paid roughly $11/person. Highly recommended!",

My heart truly broke for them. \n\nWe had been visiting a couple other local places that day, so we weren't starving. But I ordered the shrimp and filet skewers, while it's an appetizer, it could easily be a meal. The filet tips were so good, packed with flavor and very tender. The wild rice it was served over was perfectly cooked. We also ordered the arugula and prosciutto flatbread with a fig jam and topped with goat cheese. It was incredible. Loved the saltiness against the sweetness and the goat cheese added a great tang to it.\n\nGreat meal and look forward to going back soon!",

  "text": "I think Juan's gets a lot of unnecessary flack. It is what it is. I hate that saying but it is true in Juan's case. This is not the restaurant you go to for Mexican food. But then again, it never says \"Mexican restaurant\" it says \"Creole Taquería\"; whatever the heck that means. Their margaritas are delicious but small for the price. If you like your margaritas in a \"big girl glass\" and not a \"sippie cup\" go during happy hour, they're 2 for 1 (double for the price of one). If you care that the wait staff all has tattoo sleeves and not real sleeves, don't go to Juan's. \nI have to admit, I have a soft spot for Juan's. I've been coming here since I was a lowly tourist and it was a great place to grab a drink and some food when I first moved to the city and knew no one. I have numbers in my phone that say things like \"Annie-Juan's\". These were people I first met when eating at the bar by my lonesome and we had such a great time that we continued to hang out and exchange numbers. So cut Juan's some slack huh? Food wise: I love the pork and slaw tacos (usual), the Mardi Gras Indian tacos (veggie option), and the bacon azul quesadilla (when you want something that just might kill ya, but at least it's a happy death). Happy hour really is the best time to go, cheaper drinks and fewer crowds.",

  "text": "Lee How Fook is a pleasant spot to dine with friends.  It's a BYOB and we sat around after dinner, finishing our wine without feeling rushed.  Service is good (by casual Chinese restaurant standards), but food is not so much.\n\nTHE GOOD NEWS:\nSalt-baked squid is great.  Good texture, salty, tasty and fragrant.  4+ stars\n\nSauteed snow pea shoots (green leafy vegetables) are good.  I love snow pea leaves and there's nothing wrong with these! 3.5 stars\n\nWhite rice: acceptable.  Not great, not fluffy, but edible and included with meal.\n\nTHE BAD NEWS:\nPan fried wide rice noodles (ho fun) with beef: so-so, mixed.  Noodles themselves are a good texture, and fried nicely, but beef is hard to eat: overcooked, hard pieces lacking in flavour.  I was surprised by how bad the beef was, since even the mediocre Chinese restaurants I'm used to will tenderize and season their beef adequately.  Lesson learned: Avoid the beef. 2 stars for the dish.\n\nSzechuan eggplant is disappointing.  First of all, the flavour of this dish is not Szechuan at all.  Nor is it spicy.  Instead, it comes with something like a sweet and sour sauce -- and not a good one.  The texture of the eggplant was fine, tender and soft, but a disaster flavour-wise.  I normally love Chinese eggplant, but the flavour on this was such a turn-off that I didn't want to eat much of this dish.  To be avoided. 1 star.\n\nPork with mushrooms, bamboo shoots is again not something I'd want again.  Pork is overcooked, and lacked flavour.  The vegetable stuff in the dish is fine, nothing amazing, but nothing gone horribly wrong with it.  Avoid pork. 1.5 stars.\n\nSUMMARY:\nCould go back for salt-baked squid, snow pea leaves, and ho fun noodles, but I'd want to avoid anything with beef or pork.  Might need to avoid anything that requires flavouring (with sauces, slurries, etc.)  The simpler dishes seem to work best here, e.g. SQUID + SALT = yummy, GREENS + GARLIC = good.\n\nI'm putting an optimistic spin on things -- partly because I had such a great time with friends here -- but frankly, it's pretty bad when a Chinese restaurant can neither manage a dish with more than 2 main ingredients, nor pull together an acceptable sauce when so many dishes depend on it.\n\nGeneral rating ends up around 2 stars: I've definitely had better.",

  "text": "Full disclosure: the owner is a friend of mine.\n\nAnd he loves what he does. That dedication and passion for accessible cuisine really shines through here. \n\nI've probably had a third of the menu here so far - stand outs are the mac and cheese (it's not a side - share it), the banh mi sliders, the pulled pork nachos, and the homemade parmesan truffle chips. The bang bang chicken is also pretty good - be warned, however, because even though I can eat a spoonful of ghost pepper sauce and still remain coherent, the bang bang chicken made me sweat for a good 20 minutes. It's not so much a super sharp heat (6 out of 10 with ghost pepper at 9 in my opinion), but it's a sustained one. Good, but if you're not a lover of heat, you might wanna stay away.\n\nAlso, tons of beers. Ithaca beers. I'm always a bit disappointed at how many craft bars don't have Ithaca beers available, But the last few times I've been here, they had both Cascazilla and Flower Power IPA. Delicious.\n\nAlso, 5 dollars for a pour of whiskey? Seriously? Get a designated driver, and try 5 of them. \n\nIt's also a beautiful space. My kind of ambience. They also play a lot of funk, R&B, classic rock, and other selections in the dining area. Not a lot of places stray from Buddha Bar or top 40, so this was welcome change for me. Put on some James Brown and you've made my night.\n\nAlso, check out their shows and movie nights and the like throughout the week. I saw a band there last Saturday that was actually quite good. Alt rock, local band, you know the deal. I'm pissed that I forgot their name, but hey - I was 6 deep and still drinking when I got there. \n\nCheck the place out.",

The service here is superior to other fast food places as their employees were bringing out food to our table and checked in on our group as well! They even told us to leave our trays/trash. We were super thankful for that type of service from a fast food place. The food was hot and delicious. I ordered the chicken tenders and the honey mustard dipping sauce was great. The crinkle cut fries are crispy and fried to perfection. However, let's be honest, we came for the custard! Their flavor of the day was the Brownie Batter Explosion and it was so delicious. Chewy chunks of brownies mixed with their smooth and soft custard. I haven't had Culvers in over 3 years and didn't realize how much I missed it! My only regret was not getting a root beer float on top of it all!",

There is ample seating for any type of movie or festival which one is usually  hosted by the Philadelphia Film Society in October. Often this is where you will find independent movies and other documentaries not otherwise seen on the big screen. I enjoy coming to Ritz East because it's so close to Penns Landing and a lot of restaurants. \n\nWhen you purchase a large drink or popcorn they offer free same day refills. The popcorn is fresh and tasty but don't look for popping kernels in a machine, it's not made in house. Almost every time I come to this theater I make a point to take in happy hour at a local pub or restaurant because the don't have 'food'. After the movie I may take a walk along Delaware Avenue to soak in the scenery.",

I must admit, 2lbs ended up being about 5 claws and I was definitely full off that. I also ordered fries and garlic bread because I thought the crab wouldn't be enough and I was wrong. Fries were good, the basket is huge, enough to share with 3 or 4 folks. The garlic bread was meh, don't need that again.\nYes, it's market price on all of it. Prepare accordingly and ask questions.",

We used to go here after school at Triton, great times.\n\nTheir WIF (water ice and soft serve ice cream layered) is similar to Rita's gelati, but a little different.

The movies are late runs, so they have been out for quite a while.  But who gets to see all the decent movies while they are fresh out in the theater?  The movies are only $4 ($3 during the day), and the concessions are also cheap.  Sure, the sodas are not big enough to drown a small baby in, but it's still incredibly cheap for what you are getting.  My boyfriend and I managed to see a movie, get drinks and popcorn to share and we only spent $15...I challenge you to find a better movie deal anywhere in the St. Louis area.  The place is slightly out of date, but it's usually empty, so there's never any challenge to finding a seat or getting to the theater 1 minute before the movie starts.  \n\nFor example, we were the only people in the theater...which was hilarious in and of itself.  It's kind of nice to have a whole theater to yourself b/c you never feel guilty talking or laughing or getting up to go to the bathroom.

  "text": "Verde sits on Main Street in Carmel with street parking or lot parking behind the building. The restaurant is very warm and cozy with dark wood tables and booths plus an attractive, but humongous, chandelier in the main dining area. The bar area is comfortable as well with high and low top tables and several televisions. A small patio is available for outdoor dining weather permitting.\n\nThe menu has several appetizers from pork or chicken tamales, 3 types of cerviche, empandas trio and dips. I love their chips and the salsa is thicker at a mild heat level. The Indiana Street Corn is served on or off the cob and  slow-poached in butter then  smothered in cotija cheese, aioli and sprinkled with tajin spice. Messy if you order on the cob but worth it. One of my other favorites is the Chicken Tortilla Soup with a rich broth and veggies. The Street Tacos are very popular and you can mix and match your favorite 3 fillings out of 14 fillings plus add one side dish. For the unexpected, you'll find dehydrated, real Grasshopper tacos that are high in protein or try the butternut squash or octopus tacos. For those who can't have the traditional corn tortillas try the Taco De Nopal where they substitute a grilled slice of cactus, add steak or chorizo and topped with all the garnishes.\n\nI had the 3 Enchiladas De Mole but substituted shredded pork for the chicken and topped with a generous amount of tasty Mole sauce. My husband had the steak Burrito Fajita with a side of black beans. He really enjoyed the flavor and presentation of the  large burrito with the red and green sauces. He cleaned his plate and even told the Manager how much he enjoyed his meal. As we were leaving he said he'd be happy to return in the future.\n\nOur server was friendly and gave us time to check out the menu. Our food arrived, fresh, hot and timely plus our drinks were refilled.\n\nOn my next trip I'd like to try the Paella or the Red Snapper with saffron rice. So many choices look good it's hard to decide! Lunch was delicious and relaxing.",

  "text": "This 5 Guys location is massive! The food was mostly up to par, but I have to agree with a previous commenter that the fries were a bit undercooked (not as crisp). They had Mr. Pibb (Pibb Xtra) in the fountain... I can't remember the last time I've had Mr. Pibb... pre-millenium?\n\nWhat I like most about this place is that the floor isn't slippery! @15th I can be standing still and I just slowly start heading off in a direction. I especially hate it when I'm sitting down and I keep sliding. Overall, this is a better area. There are almost no bums and very few obnoxious kids.\n\nOther than that, I've been getting the same exact thing since 5 Guys opened on 15th and in this 4-5 year period the price has gone up about $1.50. For a regular drink, fries, and a cheeseburger it's $10.99. Where do you draw the line 5 Guys? If it weren't for this latest price hike, I'd give 4 stars. I repeat, WHERE DO YOU DRAW THE LINE!? For $11 there are much better options around.\n\nLastly, dining on walnut 11th-broad is better than dining on chestnut 15th-18th (liberty place included).",

Its' convenient location on Cottman Avenue and lots of parking is definitely a plus too.\n\nMe and my family went during Saturday night. Upon walking in, there is a notice on the door that state they are no longer taking dine in patrons bc it is late. We was gonna get take out so that wasn't a problem. At around 10:30pm, The Shake Seafood is jammed packed, like woah that's alot of folks dinning in and taking outs. That's a good sign!!\n\nWe order fried shrimp platter, 2 pound of crawfish, 1 pound of king crab legs, 1 pound of snow crab legs, and sweet potato fries. Hubby really likes the fried shrimp platter with the cajun seasoning fries. I love the king and snow crab legs in the Shake sauce along with the sweet potato fries. As for the crawfish, I didn't like them at all. Wasn't season very well maybe bc it is huge, but I won't get them again. Btw it is a bit pricey for the amount of food, for the items listed above, our bill is $96. I don't mind as long as the food is good, but I can't not go as often as I like, don't wanna be broke afterward lol.\n\nP.S. If you like  food that is heavy on the seasonings, then try The Shake Seafood, you won't regret!!",

We certainly expected snags, but had far fewer than anticipated, which was great!\nThe table wasn't ready at our reservation time, so we were invited into the cocktail room (just like a bar, but fancier) to have a drink while waiting. We sat down, unsure if we were to order from the bar or if there was table service. None of the employees knew either. Staff were asking each other - and by the time someone came by, our table was ready.\nFrom there, everything was PERFECT and flawless!\nOur drinks included perfectly strong coffee, a Caribbean Milk Punch and a great Bloody Mary.\nThere are three prix-fixe meals on the menu - but I ruled them out, as none had the bananas foster as a dessert. :)\nFor appetizers, we had the seafood gumbo and the roasted oysters with smoked chili butter and Manchego.\nMy friend had the escargot omelette and I opted for the Croque Madame Royal. (Instead of ham and swiss, it's proscuitto, truffle, and gruyere), topped with a sunny side up duck egg and bechamel sauce. Both were rich, obscenely decadent and delicious! \nWhile not really a huge fan of bananas, I couldn't be at Brennan's and not have the Bananas Foster. For the show more than the dish itself. What can I say, I am a sucker for a nice flambe!\nThe staff timed service perfectly. Water glasses never empty, all plates presented simultaneously. Always at the ready, but not intrusive.\nTruly, welcome back - and may this institution enjoy many more generations of legendary New Orleans quality and decadence!",

My rating may have been written in haste and misunderstanding. The title \"elite\" doesn't at all make me believe I know more than most about food.

My favorite so far are the bibimbap and their spicy Korean style sweet and spicy wings. From the moment I walked in, they were very sweet and making sure that the menu was understood. They told me that the kimchi will periodically change based on the season and that the ingredients are purchased regularly and locally. Everything on the menu looks so good that it's hard to make a solid decision at first without drooling over the next thing you see. They seem to have a real nice relationship with local visitors from the surrounding neighborhood. All of their food are best eaten fresh at the restaurant.

Compared to the oysters I had in the French quarter, these were ok, good. I just didn't like how their bread was super hard to eat, like what is this? Cardboard?? The 1/2 dozen is $14, they raised the price from what I saw on the picture menus here. I would not come back again also because while all the oysters I've eaten have been truly truly salty....I like to eat the plain bread with them to lessen the saltiness and I had a terrible time trying to bite their baguette. Other breads I've eaten during my oyster quest were a lot softer, garlic-ier, yummier. \n\nAlso had the shrimp corn bisque. That was very good!",

As many of the froyo spots are, this place does not give you the sample cups, but the staff will have to walk over and pour it out. As a consumer, I prefer the self-serve, but didn't mind the service. Unfortunately, the young lady behind the desk gave us the most unwelcoming, tired, and judgmental glares, as she rolled her eyes with two sample request, making me feel terrible for trying out froyo. I was not a super big fan of the sugary froyo flavors, but her glares made it that much more intolerable.

We've got a place in Kansas City called Syla's and Maddy's - I'm sure everyone's got their own one and the same: a college-town creamery, rich with hope and an aloof grassroots sensibility of purpose. Chalkboards abound, flavors are fun, and the prices are considerate. This place is precisely that. \n\nI think we walked out of there filled with homemade ice cream, sans $5 and change - a real deal. In places such as this, you cannot go wrong with any of their wonderful flavor profiles atop a waffle cone. Something new that I hadn't seen before was the venerable \"TCHOUPITOULAS!\" It's $30 worth of bad decisions, eight scoops and a whole mess of stuff. If you eat it all you get your name on a placard or something. While we were there, a boy was trying to impress a bunch of friend-zone girls to little avail - but he impressed me. Anyone with the sensibilities - or lack thereof - to take on I believe I heard 5 pounds of ice cream for a placard and some attention has wholeheartedly gotten mine undivided whilst I remain with a solitary cone and intrigue of what comes next. He gave up, looked sick, and lost the gaze of us all. Failure. \n\nStill, it's a nice little shop, good art, good feel, and better ice cream. If you're happening by, have a scoop of something worth the sin of indulgence.",

  "text": "I don't know if it's just me, or if others share this sentiment, but it seems the exponentially growing brewery scene in just about every city is starting to feel a little crowded and redundant. Sure, everyone has an exceptional seasonal beer every now and then, but for the most part it's the same stuff with a different witty name over and over again on everybody's tap lists. I still love going to as many new breweries as I can, but it's just starting to feel like it's getting a little difficult to find places that actually set themselves apart with something unique and memorable. Alpha Brewing has done just that, and they have done it very well. \n\nLocated in a little downtown neighborhood with some other options to eat and drink in the nearby vicinity (I recommend trying some of the crazy pizzas at The Sliced Pint), this brewery certainly doesn't leave any doubt about what it is when you walk up to the place. Behind their nice outdoor patio area is a storefront that is almost all windows, and behind those windows are stacks of barrels, 3 high and 2 deep, aging a whole bunch of beers that are probably nothing you will see at any other brewery in the entire city. \n\nI love barrel aged beers, and I love sour beers (done properly, none of that kettle souring), and alpha had more options than I could try in one sitting. Our fairly large group found a few tables to push together in the taproom that had a bar with a dozen or so seats, and maybe 6 or 7 smaller tables. There were a few people set up with some board games, and some regulars at the bar, but it wasn't too crowded for a Saturday night. It's a bright taproom that is on the quieter side of things. You can see their brewing operation through a window, which if I am remembering correctly consists of 2.5 barrel brew kettles and 5 gallon fermenters, so they are definitely a small batch place.\n\nThe tap list consisted of maybe 5 or 6 of their \"Beta Brews\" on tap, and a few more in bottles. These were the things out of their barrel aging program, and were all really unique beers. If those weren't up your alley, they also had about 6 or 7 \"Alpha Brews\", which is more normal stuff that wasn't barrel aged, but still included quite a few really cool beers. If you ended up getting dragged along to a brewery as a non-beer drinker, I believe I at least saw some wine being served. It's not often I find beers that I haven't had at least one similar iteration of at some point in the past, but Alpha had plenty of them, especially their barrel soured beers.\n\nTheir prices, although higher than normal beers, were actually pretty decent for their barrel aged and sour beers. They had flights available as well, but those were from preset lists that you couldn't mix and match. I was surprised to see howler and growler fill pricing for their Beta stuff as well. I ended up taking home quite a few bottles from here, and a lot of them were available already chilled if you were taking it somewhere to drink immediately. The bartender working when we were here was great. She was outgoing and talkative, and knew plenty about the beers and the brewery. \n\nI will definitely be back here the next time I am in St. Louis.",

  "text": "Delightful happy hour! Great cocktail choices and appetizers from 5-7pm Monday through Friday. The menu changes so be sure to call ahead if you are not sure of what you are looking for. Tonight (Friday), I enjoyed a lovely night out with Miss Tina K for a happy hour endeavor! We enjoyed Emerald Isle cocktails ($6), some wine and I also had the Debonair Martini ($8) with bleu cheese olives. The burgers are $8 and we tried the Burrata ($6) which came with roasted grape tomatoes, arugula and crostini. Very tasty! The interior of the restaurant is very beautiful with dark oak and wine inspired wood floors. Happy Hour specials are only available in the bar area which is bustling, but not impossible to find seating. Crystal was our server and she was phenomenal!! Very attentive and courteous, ensuring we were set on drinks and gave us time to ponder our menu choices. I will definitely be back for another evening at Flemings! Great atmosphere!",

  "text": "Tourist Alert: If you are staying nearby don't miss this authentic treasure!\n The feminine offspring who is now working nearby was in the mood for a decent cheesesteak so she chose Sonny's and I am glad she did. It's located right on Market Street and has outdoor seating so on this warm October day we chose to seat outside.  When we chose one of the aluminum tables we were rewarded with all the sounds of the city and some great people watching.  I'll be honest, I have passed Sonny's hundreds of times never giving it a thought. Shame on me because the proprietors serve great steaks with smiles. Peruse their website and see they value their commitment to the city in which they were born and they take pride in having been awarded GQ's best Philly cheesesteak.\n\nWe both ordered cheesesteaks with a shared order of fries. My palate was happy with the nicely chopped ribeye and perfect amount of cheese. What impressed me was how good it was minus the grease of other cheesesteaks I've had elsewhere. My daughter said it was the best meal she had all week.\nWhen my expat Philly friends are in town, I will now be taking them only to Sonny's to satisfy their cheesesteak fix.",

I usually steer clear away from this dish at home in the D.C. area because I've had some truly awful gumbo, but I knew NOLA would not let me down. After grabbing some coffee across the street, we headed over to Gumbo Shop to try a few things. \n\nIt's a fairly large restaurant, with both indoor and outdoor seating. Our server was very friendly and engaged us with lively discussion about everything under the sun. It seemed, at first impression, a place that encapsulates the New Orleans spirit - both in terms of food and people.\n\nOur first order was an appetizer of chicken andouille gumbo. I was hooked on the first taste. The boneless chicken, andouille, okra, and all the right seasonings made my knees buckle. Our server told us that this dish is known for being the best gumbo in the city. \n\nWe then ordered entrees of red beans and rice with smoked sausage and the crawfish etouffee. Unfortunately, our server thought we chose the crawfish and pasta (penne pasta with crawfish tails and tasso in a reduced cream sauce). I didn't mind too much about the mix-up, although I would have liked to try the etouffee since it's a local favorite here. However since our server insisted that we ordered this dish (and it didn't seem likely that we were able to convince him otherwise) and it was already out on the table, I dug in. It was good, so no harm no foul. The red and beans with sausage was also very delicious. \n\nIt was the perfect first meal in New Orleans.

  "text": "This may sound ridiculous, but I have been in Creole Creamery five times and sampled their ice creams before taking the dive into actually buying a scoop. This weekend I went ahead and bought two! \n\nThe first thing you notice when you walk in here is the cheery decor and the smell. The smell almost overwhelms you. It is sugary sweet and, honestly, I would come in here just to have a whiff. \n\nThen you catch a glimpse of the first ice cream area. An entire section devoted to chocolate creations. The Mexican Hot Chocolate is a favorite of mine because it combines sweet dark chocolate with spices like cayenne pepper. But, I ordered up a serving of Chockwork Orange- dark chocolate ice cream with specks of chocolate and an orange flavor. It reminded me of those orange chocolate balls that you smash on the table and they open up into orange segments. \nThe boyfriend, of course, asks the staff if they have plain chocolate. They're confused for a second about why anyone would want plain chocolate when they've created all of these other amazing concoctions, but then serve him some with a smile. \nTo compliment my chockwork orange I add on some pumpkin cheesecake. Creole Creamery does make a plain cheesecake flavor but it was the first day of October so I had to go with the pumpkin. It was creamy and just the right blend of the two flavors. \nOther flavors like the oatmeal cookie with molasses is heavenly. If you're looking for something original try the lavender honey- at first it's a little like soap- floral and not something your palate is used to- but it really is good. Try it! They will be happy to oblige with tastings (trust me). The only problem there is that they use tiny wooden spoons so you get the wood flavor that overpowers any ice cream. \n\nThe prices, I must add, are just right. I actually was taken back when she rang up my order. Creole Creamery is much cheaper than my favorite ice cream in Boston. NOTE: cash only!!\n\nI'm putting it in writing that one day I will do the Tchoupitoulas challenge- 15 scoops plus toppings that you have to finish all by yourself to get your name on a plaque on the wall. I will do it.",

  "text": "I'd heard about King Dragon for a long time, about two years, and I finally got up the non-lazies to go there. Small eating area, typical Chinese menu, \n\nBUT WAIT. \n\nHidden in the appetizer section are the Vegetable Dumplings. 8 Dumplings for $4.50. Wrapped inside a green noodle are some of the most delicious dumplings I've ever eaten. There's ACTUALLY different veggies in here! Cabbage, mushrooms, carrots, bok choy = yum. My friend told me to wait for the \"withdrawal-like cravings\" to hit. I got mine steamed, but I'm sure fried dumpling would be out of this world, because frying makes almost everything taste better. That's one lesson I've learned from Indiana.\n\nI usually get Kung Pao, but I decided to get curry chicken this time and break out of my Kung Pao box. It was pretty flavorful, not hot like the pepper on the menu suggests. The pint is a perfect dinner portion. Only problem? It was less curry chicken and more like WOW HERE ARE EIGHT ONIONS. 98% of the vegetable in the dish was white onion, with about six pieces of chicken.",

  "text": "In one month we've been to Blue Giant 3 times and it's ONLY because we need to restrain ourselves from spending all of our money in one place. We've learned a couple things from our steady attendance, here's what:\n\n- The spice level of the Dan Dan Noodles has come down significantly. Maybe the chef had an accidental heavy hand the first time or maybe they decided not to light our mouths on fire anymore, I don't know. Not a complaint or reason to rejoice, just an observation. If you came here previously and it was too spicy, give it another shot. \n- The spice level of the shrimp wontons might be dependent on whoever is cooking them. The first time we had them they were spicy, the second time we had them they were mild, and the third time was nearing Dan Dan level. Again, not a complaint, just an observation. \n- The specials, y'all. Whatever they are, just get them. We were lucky enough to catch the Duck Lo Mein after an undersold Peking Duck night and it was incredible. Same wheat noodles as the Dan Dan but covered in oily, slippery duck fat- we could've easily eaten 3 of these. \n- The Scallop Egg Foo Young is still my favorite main on the menu, but I have 3 others left to try (Mapo Tofu, Peking Duck, Salt and Pepper Catfish). The other things are great but the SEFY is probably the most unique taste.\n- The folks at the door are incredibly nice, friendly, and patient. If you're running late for your reservation just keep them informed and they'll likely hold your table. \n\nEvery friend we've brought here has loved it and will probably add to the reservation time but anything to keep these guys in business, even if they have to be shared with the rest of the city.",

Be warned - the entrees aren't that large, and if you order an appetizer and a side thinking that it's the same size as an entree, you are mistaken! The desserts all seemed AMAZING - we had the hardest time deciding between the pecan pie w/ice cream, the whiskey bread pudding, or the praline sundae..finally decided on the pecan pie with ice cream, and in the end our waiter gave it to us for free :) What a nice guy..also the decor was so adorable and old school New Orleans.",

  "text": "I enjoyed dinner Brennan's - mostly.  The restaurant is stunningly beautiful and we loved being seating in the Havana Room.  Hospitality is warm and gracious at every turn from the host to the waiters.  The dress code seems to be minimal; we changed out of our jeans into something nicer but there were people in shorts and t-shirts so I guess you can come as you are.  Social distancing was very effective with extra spacing in the dining rooms.\n\nDuring the COVID-era the menu is pared down and we were a bit concerned when the waiter only recommended 2 of the 8 entrees.  I started with delectable turtle soup and for my main had a nice smoky dish of stewed rabbit and beans.  My partner had a beef tenderloin with dauphine potato.  Food was very good but not an earth-shattering-knock-out.  My main issue was the undersized portions.  My rabbit was about the size of a chicken wing and maybe 3 oz. of protein.  The steak was quite small, too.  The prices weren't too bad ($25-$30 entrees) but I would have gladly paid a few bucks more for a more reasonable portion size.  Also there were no sides for order on the menu which would have helped round out our meal.  What's odd is the portions in the Yelp pictures all look a bit more bountiful than what we were served.\n\nDessert: I love bananas foster and this is the place to have it, complete with the excitement of a tableside flambé.  The bread pudding was excellent as well.  We had plenty of room for dessert since our mains were small which suited my sweet tooth rather nicely.\n\nI've eaten at most of New Orleans' fine dining establishments, and don't get me wrong, Brennan's was nice, but it was our most expensive meal on our recent trip and while the food was a-okay (albeit on the small size), I didn't walk out raving about any of the dishes.  It was an enjoyable meal and experience but for fine dining I have other favorite spots.",

The beer list was very extensive and I found a great IPA to enjoy. \nFood was pretty good. Nothing earth shattering but it worked. It seems most people go with a burger or sandwich situation here, which is what my two friends and I did. I got the fried chicken sandwich which was really good...I loved the pickles. My friend ordered the lamb burger which seemed interesting. \nI would not recommend the mixed drinks unfortunately. My friend ordered a margarita which a) came in the wrong glass (maybe I'm picky, but why not put it in a margarita glass?) and b) was mainly sour mix. Whenever a margarita is like neon green my suspicions are raised, as was the case here. But all that aside, for beer and a burger I'm in!",

  "text": "Three words: HAPPY HOUR NACHOS\n\nJust go during happy hour, 5-7 M-F or 1-3 Sat/ Sun, and order yourself the nachos (splurge the extra $1 for a huge scoop of guac). For $6, you'll get a beautiful mound of melty , gooey, crunchy, salty, satisfying chips with no skimping on the toppings. Best paired with 1-2 friends and a draft IPA. My vegetarian friend and I had no qualms about splitting this meat-free dish, and we hardly made a dent before my stomach finally screamed at me to stop binge eating. I probably looked like an animal, shoveling food with my hands - NO SHAME. Best nachos I may have ever eaten.\n\nI also ordered a Chilorio taco (a spicy pulled pork) and a Chorizo & potato taco - both banging, but the Chorizo definitely won. The tacos were small, like smaller than the palm of my hand, and I have little hands (I'm Donald Trump LOL). I was a little disappointed that they cost $2+ each. I'd definitely come back on $1 taco night though.\n\nBeer selection is alright, about 6 on draft and a variety of bottles/ cans, and the bar is full of any liquor you could want. The vibe is very chill - a little dim, a little tight at the bar. Hipster, but not overly; divey but clean.\n\nBartender was a little harsh. I arrived a little before 5 and I wasn't about to buy a beer when it wasn't on happy hour. When I stated I'd sip on water until 5, she rolled her eyes and kind of gave me 'tude. She was fine otherwise, average bartendery service. \n\nI'll definitely be back. This is the perfect weekday happy hour.",

Honestly, the place doesn't look like much at all viewing it from the street, but once you venture inside, you'll be glad you did. \n\nI would give this a 3.5 stars because (1) the food was very good (2) the ambiance was what I would call European romance.\n\nWas this \"real french\" cuisine? Heck if I know. I'm an American. I do know  what ever european cuisine it was, it was deliciously prepared.  Everything from the salad dressing, to the bread, to the entree down to the traditional creme brulee was thoroughly enjoyable.\n\nI don't understand giving this a low rating because someone doesn't like the wine. Huh? Yes, the restaurant name is wine house, but I'm there to eat. It is a restaurant, after all.\n\nInside looks like an adorable elderly french  (or European) wealthy grandmother decorated. I'm in to old fashioned antique-looking  decor, so this was right up my alley.  It really does look like another world in there. Ladies and gents, this is a somewhat dressy place.

  "text": "Stopped while walking Nashville upon a recommendation and scoping Yelp. Ordered a couple of appetizers and a burger. Appetizers were tot fondue and MD crab dip. Burger I ordered was the 'buy the farm burger.'\n\nATMOSPHERE: set in a restaurant neighborhood in the outskirts of downtown, there is outside seating as well as indoor seating that offers large booths and trendy music. The music could be loud if you're not into that sort of thing, but in terms of overall settings - it is very accommodating to a variety of tastes and needs for groups, etc. \n\nFOOD: The food was overall very good. The MD crab dip was good and creamy. The chips they come with were good- crispy and salty. As for the tot fondue- I don't know why I was expecting more than what it was. Kind of like the tots you get in high school with some jazzed up fondue. Wasn't a fan but it hit the spot. \n\nBurger was prepared very well. My other buds said the same- ordered it medium well and came out as ordered. \n\nSERVICE: Our waiter was on the odd side. Very attentive but not very talkative. Kept the drinks filled and did his duties. Also appreciated his willingness to only have half of his shirt buttoned. Man had a chest pelt that would make the most sterile woman blush. He also pointed where we should go to get the full Nashville experience. \n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Price wasn't bad either. $21.58 for a burger, drink and one appetizer.",

Sorry ladies but I didn't check the women's bathroom.  I wasn't in the mood for all the yelling and screaming that was likely to ensue!\n\nThe wait staff was fine.  My soda was refilled and my plates were whisked away with no problems.  I even received a nice smile and a thank you as I prepared to leave.\n\nSo what about the food? You need to know that I don't eat sushi.  I'd rather have a root canal with no pain meds that eat raw fish!  I'll leave the sushi review to someone else.  The Chinese food here is solid.  Every selection was full and kept that way while I was there.  All the temperatures were proper.  Won-ton soup was great.  The dumplings were very good.  One of the most popular buffet entrees is chicken with broccoli.  Here it was tasty but they need to use more care with the broccoli.  There were quite a few substandard pieces.  The hibachi station was excellent.\n\nNobody expects gourmet cuisine at a Chinese buffet but here you will get solid fresh-tasting A-OK food at a decent price and friendly service.  I'll be back.",

  "text": "The Quick-n-Dirty:\nLocation: Good\nAmbiance: Good\nPrice: Pretty good\nFood: Average\n\nThe Long & Drawn Out:\nOur hotel front desk staff recommended Ellendale's as a great place to eat. The location was convenient as it was right behind our hotel. So, with coworkers in tow, we headed up the hill. The restaurant itself is an old house - as it was told to us by the hotel van driver, it used to be an old dairy house back in the day. \n\nAs soon as we got in the front door, we were promptly seated in the main area near the bar. The service was good overall but the bar lagged a bit getting wine out to the table. Surprisingly, we were serenaded by a overtly loud singer/songwriter, which forced us to try and hold a business conversation a few decibels louder than what was comfortable.\n\nI ordered the vegetarian Quinoa Stir Fry. I really appreciate having a vegetarian option on the menu. The quantity was really good for the price point; however, the taste was pretty bland. I was expecting something really flavorful and plenty of vegetables but it turned out to be the opposite. Don't get me wrong, it was OK but not the best.\n\nI would probably go back the next time I'm in Nashville to see if there is something else on the menu.",

  "text": "Be still my beating heart. I may have found a new love. I've discovered a restaurant that has three of my favorites and they do them all well. I'm besides myself with excitement and can't wait to tell you about it. \n\nMy inaugural  visit here was with the ISC (International Super Club). As my usual, I arrived early. This gives me an opportunity to relax at the bar before all the members arrive. Tonight I started out with one of their signature adult beverages.  One of my favorites is a Manhattan,  which we will talk about later.  However, their Heartbreak and Setbacks is kinda similar, so that is where I begun. The. Bonded Rye was smooth and being served on the rocks made a refreshing cocktail. \n\n As I enjoyed my cocktail,  I munched on their Crab Avacado.  Once you have enjoyed this appetizer, it will be hard to go back to regular guacamole.  It's a smooth blend of avocado,tomato,onion and cilantro.   Then it is topped with shredded crab meat and served with lotus root chips. It's the perfect nosh while sipping a cocktail. \n\nSomehow my H&S was gone before the appetizer and I needed a second adult beverage. For my next cocktail, I went with my favorite, a Manhattan. To test the masterfully skills of a barkeep, I take mine up. She nailed it. Happy boozer, here. \n\nAs our members arrived, we moved to our tables. Here I started out with another of my favorites, chicken wings. They were served crispy and the mix of lemongrass and Thai Chili, was a delicious mix of tangy and heat.\n\nBefore I could order my entree, Stevie needed another cocktail. #3 would be an Old Fasioned. Again, the young barkeep nailed it. It's good to see that in addition to being creative in mixing and creating new cocktails, they are still mastering the classics.  \n\n Finally, the piece of resistance of the whole night was the Bao Soft Shell Crab.  Soft shell crab is not only one of my favorites it is one of my weaknessess.  Whenever I see it on the menu it is a must have.  This is the first time I have had it on a bao  and I can honestly say it will not be the last.  I was expecting the softshell crab to be in pieces, but to my surprise it was one entire crab placed between the bao. I first enjoyed eating my way around the bao, experiencing the delicious soft shell crab. Then I ate the bao getting the full experience of the; eel sauce, masago, kaware and mayo. That is when I said, be still my beating heart. I was in love. \n\n The ambience is extremely comfortable and modern. Their service is detailed, friendly and professional.  A combination that provides you a relaxing and enjoyable dining experience. \n\nI'll be back? - Hell, yes.  They've got three of my favorites.\n\nWhen - June 21, 2018\nWhy - International Supper Club",

I'm glad the dressing was on the side because the salad honestly did not need any. \n\nOver all, it was okay, not fantastic.

He even gives large samples of his famous lassis, and I think the first time I came here he gave mine to me free! Definitely made me come back again and again. By now, I just end up getting the mango lassi because it's one of my favorite drinks (not too sugarly, but sweet enough to satisfy me and cold enough to refresh me). I usually bring a gluten free chaat back for my boyfriend, and while I'm not a big fan of chaat in general because of its spices I do enjoy nibbling a few bites off his plate, since all the ingredients are crispy and fresh. The only reason this didn't get 5 stars is that it's slow sometimes to get your order when there's a line, because there is only one employee and he painstakingly makes each order by hand (and with a smile!), so it sometimes gets me a bit impatient..but I would not compromise the fantastic service for all the quickness in the world, because that's what makes this place so great!",

The chicken had some nasty pieces in it and I had a huge chunk of pork fat on my carnitas plate.  \n\nBesides the fact that their menu is limited and they dont have margaritas, I'm going to vote Felipe's holds King of burrito joints.",

They did call around and found that this Walgreens had what I needed.  They worked with Dan, the pharmacy manager,  to ensure that the paperwork and insurance check marks were all cleared. I drove out to the location on Apple and Parkcenter and found Dan working busily helping a slew of customers.  He asked me for my name and knew instantly as to the reason why I was there.

Once you step inside, immedieatly you feel the nostalagia of the restaurant. Inside it feels like as if I stepped into my grandparents home in which I was about to be served a great home cooked dinner! \n\nThe waiters there were very attentive to us and asked us if we had been there before to which we had not. They explained that it was a family run business and has been in the area for generations serving the local community. Shortly after, we were served a loaf of bread with house made honey butter - we must have killed 3 loafs between the 3 of us !\n\nThey had a great brunch menu and I was so happy that they had the schnitzel on the menu. The misses orderd the liver & onions and my mom ordered the beef brigninon. Her dish was a little salty but the schnitzel I ordered was quickly finished as it too me back to the schnitzel dinner I had during my last trip to Austria!\n \nIf your looking for a nice place to take the relatives for a quiet intimate location, come check this place out!",

I ordered elote( corn, lime, aioli and cheese) and Las Favoritas( chorizo stuffed dates wrapped in bacon) to start. The elote was with clear winner between these two dishes. I also had the opportunity to try Bombas Contigo( fried potato with bacon with brava sauce); I love potatoes and I loved theses as they were formed with potato shreds and not fried mashed potato.\nI enjoyed shared carafe of red sangria followed with a Pisco Punch and they were standard for me. Just OK cocktails. My husband and I shared the Parillada platter which is described as: Ribeye, chorizo, morcilla, lamb chop, roast marrow, salsa verde, chimichurri, and seasonal vegetables. So basically it was a plate of meat, which is what we were expecting but no real side to the dish. My husband and I loved the morcilla (blood sausage); who knew blood sausage could be so tasty? All this was finished off with one surprisingly great dessert called the Capirotada( bread pudding with figs and goat cheese?), that was rich without being heavy.\n\nIt was a very busy night and so initially our service was attentive and then it went down hill.\nIn the midst of conversation, the waiter handed us our bill.  So I asked him, he aren't you going to tell us about your great desserts?  However, it took so long to arrive that I regretted ordering dessert; a line had crossed. My husband wanted to leave as the place was getting increasingly crowded but we were in limbo waiting for my dessert while sitting outside in a breezy evening on the patio at 8pm, with an hour drive home in our future.",

  "text": "Joella's Hot Chicken is the first Indiana location of a small Kentucky-based chain of \"hot chicken\" restaurants with Ohio soon to join the crowd. \n\nHot Chicken, for the uninitiated, is a \"tradition\" that is said to have started in Nashville, TN and basically takes your traditional Southern fried chicken and gives it a kick. In the case of Joella's, that \"kick\" comes in varying degrees ranging from \"no heat\" (which really is pointless if you're actually coming here) to spiked honey (sweet mild), Ella's Favorite (a sort of mid-range option), Tweener (medium heat), Hot (spicy fire!), and Fire-in-Da-Hole (the hottest, indeed). They have six chicken plate options including, yes, an actual vegan option. I ordered a 3 Jumbo Tenders Plate that comes with one of several dipping sauce options along with one of several sides. You can get the tenders grilled upon request. \n\nThe drink is not included in the plate and my entire meal, including drink, came in at just over $11, a fairly standard price for this Indy/Fishers border area. \n\nJoella's also offers \"Sammies,\" Salads, a handful of dessert options, and they do serve beer, soft drinks, bottled craft/flavored sodas, and both sweet/unsweet iced tea. \n\nIn case you don't realize it, Joella's took over the spot vacated by 96th Street Steakburgers. The interior is in more of a Southern/Americana theme and it appears that they are working on adding an outside dining area. They do not offer drive-thru - worth noting since the drive-thru in the building is still present. \n\nThey have a couple of accessible parking spots and you should note that the only curb cut is on the east side of the restaurant (the same side as the accessible parking - for once, logic prevails!). \n\nAs you enter, you are immediately surrounded by the dining area and the ordering counter is straight ahead. You order, they give you a number and you get your own drinks from a fountain to the left. The fountain is not particularly wheelchair friendly, though I was able to make it work. \nI thought the cups were a tad small - not sure of their size, maybe 16 or 20 oz, but for a place that emphasizes hot food I definitely found myself wishing I didn't have to go back up to get a refill. \n\nThe food? The chicken is hormone free and you can definitely taste the difference. As I get older, preservatives kick my booty and my body did fine with this chicken. The jumbo? Definitely not jumbo. I found myself looking at it and thinking of at least a half dozen local restaurants with bigger tenders, though certainly I would consider them jumbo compared to most chains. The fries, which I chose as my side, were of a shoestring variety and were served in a nice serving size. \n\nIf I could, I'd likely lean toward a 3.5 star rating. However, I really liked the friendly service and felt like that hospitality factor allows me to up the rating rather than lower it. I wouldn't say this is my favorite chicken, or even chicken tenders, in Indy but it's a place I wouldn't hesitate to eat while in the neighborhood.",

  "text": "This review is specific to Meijer Pickup. Pre-COVID, I shopped in-store and enjoyed the experience. Meijer is generally clean and well-stocked and I can find what I need.\n\nI recently did a Meijer Pickup order. Note: this was the weekend before Thanksgiving, so I'm curious if my experience was atypical due to the upcoming holiday. \n\nLong story short: I arrived at the pickup area outside the Starbucks entrance and texted the number provided, and it took a grand total of 30 minutes for an employee to bring out my order. There were four other cars waiting alongside me. It's clear they were understaffed, as the poor employee was the only one bringing out groceries. \n\nIt was also odd because earlier that afternoon, a Meijer employee called me to go through the substitutions and out-of-stock items, and to let me know my order was ready early and I could come pick it up.\n\nOverall, I found Meijer's pickup experience to be inefficient, especially compared to Kroger. With Kroger, everything is done within the app, including accepting/declining substitutions and letting the store know I'm on my way or I've arrived. I never wait more than five minutes tops at Kroger. \n\nMeijer would benefit to have the pickup area be separate from the busy main entrance. Kroger's system works well because their pick-up is on the side of the building so the employees don't have to walk far to get to customers.",

Gumbo Shop is one of the many places in New Orleans where a line may form to dine. \n\nIt's tough picking a place to eat for a group of six people. We decided to wait it out for some Yelp approved gumbo. Gumbo Shop is a restaurant where the line spills out onto the street around the front where you can peer in at those who are already dining. Don't drool on the window as that is rude to those trying to enjoy their food. Wait and wait until you are in a dark hallway like alleyway that is feet away from the entrance to the restaurant. \n\nStaff here is organized and do no seat any parties that don't have all persons in the group present. No exceptions. \n\nYou're seated and greeted by friendly staff who serve you your cajun/creole traditional dish. I had the gumbo and the crawfish etouffee. The etouffee was the better of the two and I would highly recommend it.",

  "text": "I must say I was a little worried when I entered a BBQ joint with a full bar.\n\nI was raised on BBQ in places that had little lighting, where side dishes were a luxury, and Wonderbread and sauce are the only distractions one needed from the main event.  I myself also love making BBQ, which I adhere to as a religion, rubbing meats and brining birds days in advance, and slow smoking tough animal protiens until they become cookie dough over the span of half a day or more.\n\nThe shrimp corn dogs with avocado sauce were good, as was the Pig Burger.  A nice, fatty, flavorful burger with Benton's and a fried green tomato on a potato roll.  I got it with 'Pate of the South' and they didn't flinch at making it medium-rare, as per my request.  I had some greens on the side, which were good, but not exceptional.  \n\nThe brisket on Texas brioche was quite good too.\n\nI am headed back there to take my CEO and our executive team there tomorrow night - I plan on diving in more to their BBQ specifically and I will update as soon as I do.  Assuming I still have a job.\n\nUPDATE:\nI went back there with the CEO and the rest of the bosses and it was a great meal.  Shame on me for not getting BBQ my first time there.  I got the STL Spare Ribs (I'm a bad, bad Jew) and sampled the brisket.  Everyone there loved it and we had a pretty good mix as the home office is in TX, and we had people who hailed from STL as well in our party.  I am still employed, so it was a success.  Also had the onion rings, greens, sorghum beans, guacamole - all of which hit the spot.\n\nFinished off with the John Daniels (we go way back) banana pudding - perfect comfort food, and sampled the peanut butter cup which was also fabulous while it lasted.\n\nThe service was also excellent.  I still feel guilty eating in a BBQ joint that is so clean and has so many sides, but smoked meats dissolving in your mouth is worth it.  The only thing pretentious are the prices.  Upgrade to 4 stars!\n\nOne more note, watch out for the cocktail prices - TEN DOLLARS PER!  I think someone has themselves confused with The Patterson House.",

In my opinion, the best fries are served at In-N-Out, the waffle fries at Chick-fil-a, and Burger Bar, Las Vegas (sweet potato fries). If you're into the thick cut fries then this might be for you. I'm more into skinny fries but fries that are a bit more crispy than their thicker brethren.\n\nService here is ok. The at the counter was not very helpful as he had not tried more than half of the menu (at least he was honest about it) and the place is clean. Maybe a bit too clean as some parts of the restaurant smelled of clorox.\n\nThere's plenty of parking as it's a huge shared lot with the other stores in the plaza.\n\nHonestly, nothing to write home about but definitely a step up (in quality and price) from the other fast food chains (i.e. McDonald's, Hardy's, etc)\n\nParking: Plenty\nWait: 5-10 mins after ordering\nPrice: $9+ per person",

You have to buy guacamole if you want to add that to anything. I recommend the new steak taco --really good, the cauliflower taco and the chicken taco--all different flavors and awesome. They have great fresh brewed iced tea. The guacamole was really good. The chips are a little on the salty side but you can scrape some of that off. It wasn't very busy for lunch on Saturday which was fantastic. Great service. Love the decor throughout the restaurant and in the bathrooms!",

I recognize all the trappings of crust punks and bike punks, despite the gutter punk decor. (Hot tip: gutter punks don't like having jobs. It gets in the way of harassing tourists on Frenchmen St.) Then again, this is probably not the place to bring your sweet church-going mother unless she's okay with a server who has been around the block a few times...on a fixie. (Hot tip: hipsters aren't the only ones with fixies.) \n\nI should probably talk about the food and not just the servers, amirite? Okay. There is a lot of food. I know this sounds simple and stupid, but bear with me. The food comes in large quantities. Larger than average. Larger than New Orleans typically spews forth. So get your tum ready or take a box home. (I double-fisted a burrito one night, and I still brought some home for later.) \n\nAnd there are vegetarian options. Like, real ones. Granted, they read like a stoner dreamt them up in a haze of really good purple kush (that's a type of pot, right?); but darn if they aren't tasty. I recommend the Mardi Gras Indians if you're feeling tacos. \n\nHere is your super-pro tip about hot sauce: There are multiple bottles of spicy liquid available for your consumption. If you think you have what it takes to go toe-to-toe with the big boys (and girls) of hot sauce, ask your server for the really spicy one. They'll usually say, \"Oh, I brought you the hot sauce.\" That's when you look at them calmly and request, again, the REALLY spicy one. This will usually get you what you want. \n\nAlso, for the confused: this is a Creole Taquería. That means it's not any real sort of food; this place is a mash-up. A good one. If I were about to make a musical comparison, I might compare Juan's to the Grey Album by DJ Danger Mouse: smooth, splendid, not to everyone's taste. Sometimes, you just need the classics. (Oh god, this review reads like I'm stoned.) \n\nAccessibility notes: Half of the restaurant is accessible for mobility devices. The men's restroom is not accessible because it is up a step. Ditto for the bar. No braille signage or menus. Can get super loud at peak hours. Most of the booths are narrow and difficult to get into.",

  "text": "I was intrigued when I saw that a ramen place was opening in New Tampa. I feel bad for any business that had to open during a pandemic, but Michi Ramen has pivoted to handle it better than any other business I've seen. I personally will only do curbside and delivery right now. The setup they have for curbside pickup is fantastic. You walk up and speak into an intercom. There's a slot in the window for you to put your card into. There's a tiny box with doors on each end they can put your receipt in and another similar large box where they can put your food.  You never have to get close to another person and they always have taken care of us quickly!\n\nTo be honest I liked, but didn't love their ramen.  What really has intrigued me is their tea bar. They have several green tea drinks, a few milk teas (with no boba), but also have *yogurt* drinks. I see that even though they have 40+ reviews I'm the first person to mention this. I really had no idea what to expect with a yogurt drink. I thought that \"yogurt\" could possibly mean that it had a thick consistency, but that's not the case. The yogurt apparently just gives it a more powerful flavor. So far my favorite is the grape yogurt drink. It's really refreshing unlike anything I've ever tasted. Thanks for bringing something new to the area Michi Ramen.",

Flatbread pizzas, sure, but also no buns, just flat bread sandwiches and flatbread burgers. I must admit it worked because the food was tasty and made well. The flatbreads were fresh, hot, and enjoyably soft. Both the spicy chicken sandwich and the burger were good.

On Monday evening I got to have a rare just the two of us dinner with my Father and since we are both always looking for the newest thing I mentioned The Mad Crab and we headed to U. City. It's a large place (formerly Kim Son) and it's decorated with a nautical theme. When the hostess seats you they cover your table in white butcher paper. We went for the largest combo, The Hangry Combo ($76.99.) We chose King Crab Legs, Shrimp, Mussels, and clams. They boil this with corn on the cob, red potatoes, and sausage. For flavoring we chose the Whole Sha-Bang (mild.) We got a side order of garlic bread to dip in the sauce/boil. They give you a plastic bib, plastic gloves, a seafood cracker, and a seafood sheller and dump the bag of boiled seafood onto the paper covered table for you to figure out. It was so great! We cracked the crab legs, scooped out the clams and mussels, and peeled the shrimp. It was savory and spicy even with the mild seasoning and I like spice. Loved the sausage and potatoes too! The spice and boil made a kind of broth/sauce and it was delicious dipping the garlic bread in it. Next time I'll try the French fries for dipping purposes. This was way too much food for two people and we lugged home a hefty to-go box but we have big eyes and wanted to try EVERYTHING! I can't wait to go back. The service isn't the best and they don't have a liquor license yet but who cares? Believe me when I tell you there is absolutely nothing else like this in St. Louis or anywhere close!

  "text": "Seems like an odd location at first, but it really is not that far from Westchase and all those other restaurants and hotels to the south and west on Tampa Road are not far away either.\n\nNo doubt I like this location significantly more than the one in Centro Ybor in every possible way.\n\nParking is more plentiful than it looks from the road although all those signs posted about not parking on the grass suggests they may not have enough when they attract a capacity crowd.\n\nThe interior is much larger than it appears from outside as well, and the design is very modern and comfortable.\n\nBar runs long, high-top table runs just as long right next to that and table seating fills the rest of the room.\n\nOutside offers a modest size tiki bar with lounge/patio seating surrounding it.\n\nAs you would expect, there is plenty of craft beer to choose from and something they call a Mug Club to save regular visitors some money. There's also a bartender named Olivia who is good at making customers happy.\n\nWhile I'm not a regular wine drinker, the fact that eight wines are offered \"on tap\" was a new and interesting thing to me.\n\nFrom a menu standpoint, this TBBC features a good selection of apps, salads, burgers, pizzas, calzones and dinner plates. Portion sizes do justify the price.\n\nAs a soft pretzel snob, I am extremely impressed by the Moosekiller Barleywine mustard dip that accompanies this item. \n\nIf they ever sold this by the growler, I might buy that to take home in bulk.",

  "text": "Pretty legit place for Korean food. \n\nI am not an expert on Korean food by any means....but I am at least looking to try new things provided they aren't spicy to avoid subsequent heartburn & certain colon-rape the following day.\n\nI can't remember the name of what I ordered here but it basically translated into Ox Bone Soup. It sounded like it would be really rich but it was actually quite bland. I actually preferred the item that Sean H. ordered which was some type of garlic-y chicken stuff. I would DEFINITELY order it again. It had far less gristle than the chicken from JooJoo's.\n\nService was alright but nothing to write home about. Overall cost of food was quite expensive for just two people (with one beer and a soda too, no dessert.)\n\nWould I come back? Maybe for the chicken stuff. I also enjoyed some of those little dishes they bring out right after you order. As soon as she set the plates down I had to separate the things that looked spicy away from the \"safe\" looking items. I would have asked her to explain what things were and the names so I could write down the stuff I liked, but we got there pretty late and they were going to close within the hour so everyone was busy trying to clean up in preparation for closure, so I didn't want to bother her while she was busy cleaning.\n\nBut yeah, next time for sure, I need to learn the names of the stuff I like so I can order with ease at the next Korean place I go to. (And hopefully pronounce things correctly.) I'd love to learn how to speak Korean so I could talk to the waitstaff.\n\nAlso a plus - this place isn't too far from my house & workplace.",

I can't believe in all the many years we have been coming to this area F and I have never been here.\nWe ended up at Martine's after a fundraiser for the William Trent House in Trenton NJ. We only stopped in for a after dinner cocktail. The friend who brought us here is a regular and apparently many of the local restaurant workers end up here after their shifts. You can tell it's a friendly neighborhood hang out, very welcoming and laid back at this time ( after 11) on a Saturday night. There was plenty of seats at the bar as well as tables inside and out.\n\nThe barman made me a delicious Jamison cocktail, which I nursed the rest of the night.\n\nI'm really looking forward to coming back again and trying the food. I loved the cozy ambience and would like to experience it at an earlier time of day. Can't wait!",

So they meet the bare minimum. Good thing they surpass it.\n\nFor starters, get the pickles and slaw \"bare snack\". Two kinds of vegan slaw. The whole thing is fantastic. It made the perfect sharing item for a party of three.\n\nThey also have so many toppings and sides that are vegan. The vegan sandwiches they offer can be modified to add these items such as chickpea onions and stout onions. \n\nMy wife and I split two vegan sandwiches, Guadalupe burger and the Mazuma tempeh sandwich. Both were great. I especially appreciate that they make their own veggie burger. No Morningstar Farms here.\n\nFor dessert we had the vegan carrot cake. The only item we ate that we didn't love. I would skip it net time.\n\nSeriously, the meal I just had there compares very favorable to the many great all-vegan restaurants in Philadelphia. I am very very impressed.",

It was a really nice day and we sat outside in the garden, which is green and beautiful and overall really lovely. We got a few dishes to share and most of the food was incredible, as was the service. \n\n---Garlic bread: I LOVED the fresh head of garlic to spread on the already prepped garlic bread. \n---Eggplant parm: Delicious. Light and tender with a sort of nutty flavor. All three of us absolutely  loved it and I'd definitely get it again.\n---Pan seared gnocchi: I don't normally like gnocchi but this was really wondeful. The gnocchi had a great consistency and the dish overall was really fresh and warming. I loved the cherry tomatoes and mushroom! I would absolutely recommend this dish.\n---Nonni's spaghetti and meatballs: I found this dish to be the least exciting of the three. The spaghetti is pretty standard and the meatballs, while good, are nothing that blew me away. It's a huge portion which I imagine would be a huge draw to some, but I'd rather a smaller portion of something more flavorful. \n---Apple crostini: good, but not that special or interesting. Next time I'd try one of their other desserts.",

  "text": "My Yelp friends in Westchase have been raving about Siam Thai Restaurant, and I was anxious to give it a try. Thai cuisine is still new to me, and I wanted to have something different rather than the typical noodle bowl or dish of curry.\n\nThis restaurant is located along Linebaugh Avenue and directly across the street from Westchase Elementary, in a little two-block stretch of restaurants and retail establishments. It's in the same little shopping area as Tijuana Flats, World of Beer, and Burger 21.\n\nThe interior is decorated simply, yet elegantly with artwork and antiques, and there is a sense of peace and calm despite the busy nature of the restaurant. When I was there for dinner, every table was filled, but you never sensed that they were trying to rush you out of the door. Families were coming in and out to pick up carryout orders, and the restaurant stayed busy the entire time we were there.\n\nWe started with Tom Yum soup which is one of the most popular soups in Thailand. Tom Yum Soup has many health benefits, due its potent combination of herbs and spices, and in fact, this Thai soup is currently under scientific study as it appears to have immune-boosting power as a natural remedy for cold and flu viruses. Mom always said that soup is good for you!\n\nThe soup is made with chicken broth, minced lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, a variety of chilies, straw mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, and all kinds of spices and herbs. To that they add your choice of seafood or meat, and you end up with a delicious hot and sour soup. It had a bit of a peppery kick, which will clear your sinuses without causing you pain.\n\nFor the main course we shared Siam Scallop and Shrimp which was pan-seared seafood with broccoli florets, sliced carrots and cabbage in a delicious chicken stock / garlic broth with a bowl of sticky white rice.\n\nDelicious dinner that was reasonably priced. I'll definitely be back to try some other dishes.",

  "text": "It's not every day that we city folk can see live gators, wild boars, and a bald eagle in its natural habitat. Really enjoyed this tour, don't think I'd go visit this park of Louisiana if they didn't provide the means to do so.  They pick you up in a van at your hotel (for an additional fee of course), drive you to the swamp, load you on the boat for the 2 hour tour, and drive you back to your hotel.  It takes up about 4 hours of your day, but it's worth it in my opinion.  \n\nHow much wildlife you see depends a lot on the weather and the season. I went in October, so it was right before the gators begin to hibernate. I think in the colder months you don't see any gators at all (Nov-Jan) so be warned.  They don't guarantee anything.  Also during the hot, muggy summer it gets really hot and humid and the bugs are out.  We got to see about 10 gators, 3 good sized ones up close.  A lot of them had been poached due to aggressive hunters during hunting season though, which is a very sad thing.  Usually hunters leave these ones alone or aren't so aggressive, but for some reason this season was extremely brutal to the local natural area.\n\nYou also get to see wild boar who are running around in packs.  They aren't afraid of the swamp tours and actually actively pursue them, because it means food, i.e. marshmallows!  Wildlife, including gators, apparently love sugar just as much as humans.  Our captain, who is hilarious and told jokes all through the tour, was very adept at chucking the marshmallows to bring the animals closer to us.  He knew several of the animals by name, which makes sense since he probably sees them 2 or 3 times a day.\n\nMake sure you bring plenty of water as you're sitting in a boat the whole time.  If it's hot outside, you'll want to bring a hat as well.  Also, make sure you go to the bathroom before you get on the boat at the Cajun Encounters building.  It would be an uncomfortable 2 hours if you don't.  \n\nA great way to see nature without getting yourself dirty.",

Sure.\n\nWe went here for the first time with the International Supper Club - an ad-hoc group of Yelpers who enjoy trying cuisines from other countries.  \n\nBao are buns.  We had a discussion at the table about what makes them unique but we never got to the bottom of it.  I did a little research before sitting down to write this review and the answer is that it is a relatively standard dough that is steamed instead of baked.  When the restaurant griddles them lightly they pick up an even more unique combination of flavors and textures.\n\nI ordered a couple of appetizers: dumplings and wings.  Both were quite good but the wings were the more unique of the two.  Think of wings that are coated in a bunch of less common ingredients like lemongrass and rice powder and you're on the right track.\n\nI chose the three little bao for dinner and they came out on a small wooden cutting board.  The first one I grabbed turned out to be my favorite - it was stuffed with tempura-fried slices of tofu and yam then topped with a house-made sauce and a few leaves of cilantro.  Next up was the pork belly, followed by the waygu beef.  Odd as it seems, the first one remained my favorite by a long shot.  I also snagged a bite of the kids' char siu bao and they were something I could see myself ordering on a future visit.",

  "text": "Jennie M and I headed over to The Marc optimistic that they may be open on Remembrance Day... We wandered inside only to learn that they were not open for lunch.  But they were going to be open for dinner that night!\n\nSo, we headed elsewhere for lunch but ventured back later that night (post elite-event).  Our party had grown into to three and we called ahead to make sure they could accommodate us.  Luckily, the answer was yes!  We strolled in around 9pm and were greeted warmly by the staff.  \n\nAs I'd noted earlier, The Marc is one large open room, but it's tastefully decorated and has a cozy feeling to it.  The dinner menu is limited, but there's likely something for everyone on it...\n\nWe started out with some olives to munch on in addition to some fresh bread...\nIt did take awhile to order and get our food, but it was well worth the wait, and we weren't in a rush.  I had Manhattan Clam Chowder and a Caesar Salad and cleaned both my bowl and my plate!  I also did some damage to the side of frites we ordered for the table. My dining companions seemed to enjoy their meals as well... \n\nNeedless to say, I think we were all pretty full after our meals, but our waitress talked us into sharing dessert - a chocolate turtle pie of sorts that was the perfect sweet ending to a wonderful day!  The Marc is definitely a dining experience to remember and visit again in the future.",

  "text": "It's very very bare-bone and low key with regards to ambiance and seating BUT the food is solid and portions are reasonable.  It's popular for takeout but the service is very friendly and attentive if you dine in, as well.\n\nSome highlights:\n1. Pumpkin curry with chicken: Solid red curry broth with tender pieces of sliced chicken breast and plenty of kombucha squash and a pepper and carrot medley.  This was tasty and the curry was great mixed with the rice.\n2. Pas See Yew: Solid with plenty of fried egg (loved that!).  The seasoning was very good and flavorful without being overly salty.\n3. Pad Thai: This version has a creamier sauce with a heap of ground peanuts on the side, topped with shredded cabbage and chopped scallions.  The noodles themselves are thinner than average, which made them a bit on the dry side.  The flavor was solid, though, and there was plenty of fried egg, which I loved.  That's actually my favorite part of any stir-fried noodle dish!\n4. Pineapple fried rice with chicken: Decent with chunks of pineapple, cashews, and plenty of peas.  This has a stronger curry flavor than other versions but it was tasty and the raisins gave it a nice flavor twist.\n5. Spicy house noodle; Wide rice noodles stir-fried in a red curry sauce.  This was very good and I loved the concept of sauteing noodles in a curry broth.  I'm definitely a noodle fan vs. rice and this was the perfect combination.\n\nIf you don't mind eating in a takeout-like setting and are just coming for solid food, then it's a good dinner option.  Otherwise, get the takeout.  It's not the most authentic Thai and not Asiana or Thai Orchid but the dishes are tasty and they are open until 10 pm everyday.",

  "text": "Although I don't know much about gaming, I stopped by this shop across Meridian from Circle Centre Mall to see what kind of games they had.  The shop is long and narrow with the displays of games up front by the check out counter and entrance.  The back half of the store is set up with lots of tables for groups of players to be able to enjoy their purchases.  I can't tell you if the arrangement of the tables is conducive to playing all types of games or not, but I'm sure the staff can help meet your needs.\n\nI was also glad to see that they did carry some more \"old fashioned\" board games that are self contained and suitable for most levels of family to play.  They also had puzzles and a selection of Monopoly games that had unique themes I hadn't seen before.\n\nOh, and don't let the downtown location make you think you are paying too much.  I checked some pricing compared to that certain online giant that delivers to your home and this place was within 10% of the online giant.  I like supporting local businesses, so when I can, I buy from actual stores and save the online for things that I just can't find elsewhere.\n\nOverall, I came away with a favorable impression of this store.\n\nReview #1968",

I like that you can customize your order or choose something pre-made off of the menu. The ingredients taste fresh, for the most part - I have to point out that one time I got take out from here and the special sauce had gone bad but they still gave it to me... it's like who ever put it in the bag wasn't looking at it even though it was not the right color. The service is always great and despite it being a made-to-order place it's usually pretty quick! There is one other thing besides my bad take out experience that caused me to dock this place to three stars. Price... for what it is, a burger joint, it's expensive and, yes, I understand the concept of fresh ingredients but let's be real, you're overpriced. I could see myself coming back for a treat but when there are many other cheaper or healthier options in the neighborhood it's not at the top of my list.",

One of the things that caught my eye on the way in was an extremely nice bar. It gave me an idea of where I could possibly stop in for happy hour in the future. But since it was late, I took a seat inside the restaurant. Nicely decorated interior, and somewhat loud inside. But it was a nice crowd and festive type of environment. \nI never had the ribs with Jack Daniel's sauce. After ordering them, I realized that I'll be ordering something else next time. The ribs and sauce could use some tweeking. Not a deal breaker since there wasn't high expectations as far as the food goes. \nI'll be back because I like the atmosphere. I'll just keep my food ordering to a tapas type of minimum until I find something that I might eventually enjoy.",

  "text": "I LOVE Big Lots! \n\nYeah, they have lots of cheap Asian junk, but you can also find BARGAINS GALORE on tools and household goods.\n\nBut what keeps me going back are the CLOSE-OUTS of brand-name or equivalent-to-brand-name-quality FOOD ITEMS.  If something doesn't sell well at major chain stores, the manufacturer still has to dump their warehouse full of stuff that the major chain stores don't want anymore. And that's where Big Lots comes in.  \n\nGranted, there is often a reason why something doesn't sell at the big name chain stores and it ends up in a close-out store.  But sometimes the reason is not quality, it's just the taste of the average buyer.  And if you happen to be \"odd\" or a \"discriminating consumer\" (like me) and like something that the majority  doesn' t like (which happens all the time to those of us who really do have good taste, snort, snort,  :-), then you can sometimes find it at Big Lots for a GREAT PRICE!  OY VEY! SUCH A DEAL!\n\nSo here's my strategy: I shop the food aisles every week,  try a little of something I might like, and if I like it, go back the next time and buy a LOT of it, because when it's gone, it's gone.\n\nThe employees at this store are pretty helpful and friendly too. They'll help you look for something.\n\nAre you a fan of Tuesday Morning?  If so, Big Lots is the lower-priced version of Tuesday Morning.  I've sometimes seen the same things on sale for cheaper at Big Lots.\n\nCaveats:  #1:  Check the expiration date of all food items before you put them in your cart. They are notorious for having out-dated food. Most everything is fine, but every once in a while they have out-dated product.  #2:  The store is not the cleanest.  #3: This ain't Carmel, and not even Glendale.  Think PeopleOfWalmart.com \n\nNote: I do not work at Big Lots, never have, and do not own stock in them. I just luuuuuuuuuuuuuv saving money!",

  "text": "\"What kinda cheese?\" I need to know that first!\"\n\nMaybe snotty service is their schtick. If it's not, it's a good thing that they have good food to help make up for the ray of sunshine we encountered on our visit.\n\nWe popped into Sonny's for a late lunch, the two meat eaters in the group wanting to compare it to Tommy DiNic's. My friend went first, she followed the sign* ordering a beef with onions and was just about to get to the Whiz when the lady barked that she was doing it wrong. When it was my turn, I ordered a grilled cheese and was met with a sneer telling me it would take 10 minutes and asking if I still wanted it. Yes, yes I did. I got a disgusted look when she clearly didn't approve of my american and bleu cheese combo.\n\nMy friends quite enjoyed their cheeseteaks. Not as much as Tommy DiNic's, but better than Campo's. My grilled cheese was good, although the thick broche bread was a little stiff after the sandwich press. Still a decent showing for a place specializing in beef. We also got fries, I would file these under skippable; very thin, they reminded me of McDonald's fries.\n\nWould I go back? Depends. On my own, no. With some cheesesteak seekers, yes. I'd probably would give this place a 3.5 or 4, if it weren't for the assholery that we encountered.\n\n* In case you're wondering, here's how they ask you to order:\nhttp://goo.gl/0pTZzr",

  "text": "It was the one snowy/rainy eve this season. The wife, yes we got married about a month and 5 days ago, found herself with a migraine, incapacitated on the couch. Clearly she was in no mood to create something delicious, and we both needed to eat. So what were we to do?\n\nOption 1 was to unleash me on the kitchen to cook...which would have resulted in a mountain of dirty dishes that would certainly  survived for at least a few days. NOPE!\n\nOption 2 was to dine on something delivered...which sounds great in theory until you realize Reno is really remiss in this regard. GUESS NOT!\n\nOption 3 was easily the least desirable decision we could make...which I was not so willing to welcome. See, since the food wouldn't come to us, I had to fetch the food. Worse than that, we couldn't come to a consensus on what we wanted when we did finally decide to do the deed! \n\nAnd then, out of nowhere, one of us suggested Indian, and all at once the world was one again. It was the answer to all our desires, the only thing strong enough to motivate even me to leave my perch on the couch to brave the roads, to retrieve dinner for us.\n\nWe ordered our food through the Yelp app! Rich and creamy Saag Paneer, rich, velvety sweet and savory chicken korma, and an eggplant dish, all ordered hot and spicy, along with garlic naan and  onion kulcha, rice, chutneys, and naturally two mango lassis were bagged up and ready to go when I arrived. It was so easy! You can pay with a credit card before picking your food up, which made it super fast too!\n\nI returned home and was instantly a hero! My skills as a great husband were spread far and wide across the internets and, for an instant, I was famous!\n\nSo for this update I'm going to up it a star because of the seamless process, absolutely delicious food, and friendly service, and for making me worthy of worship!!' \n\nThanks India Kabab!\n\nThis is the best Indian in town!",

  "text": "The battle for supremecy in the \"Best Cheesesteak\" in Philly is and has been an ongoing battle. Everyone has their favorite, their \"ole reliable\" for that \"go to\" spot. A fierce compititon to be number 1 and I am more than willing to accept this kind of challange.  A 1200 plus calorie induced challange types of deliciousness, and Sonny's you have made my top 3!\n\nHoly goodness as I entered Sonny's , I was greeted with an inviting aroma of angus and ribeye on the grill doing its thing.(Angus for the burgers, Ribeye for the steaks) We all know that hum of meat being cooked, that sizzle that just makes you do a little shimmy. Best part about Sonny's they always start off with a clean slate. Meaning once one steak is made they clean it off and start with the next one.  They don't keep a heaping mound of meat on the grill like other places do.  From what I have seen at least , that my friends of Yelp makes for a great feast to be had.\n\nSo what does Nando go with? The options they offer , the combinations of a mouthwatering taste buds going into shock kind of pleasures. I decided to go with Sonny's  Bacon (Apple wood is used) cheesesteak with American cheese, compliment it with wiz and fried onions for the win. Basically a Wiz and American Wit if you want to know the lingo, without looking like a tourist. (That was for you out of town noobs) \n\nI place my order and already I start to do the happy dance ! (my inner self was feeling the flow)  I get my masterpiece as I give the all knowing \"nod\" to the man wheeling that spatula. I must say before I get this they lightly toasted my roll and dressed the bottom of the roll with Wiz. After that they then added the goods with a layer of good ole Americana on top sealing everything in. A blanket you might say to keep it snug with the meat cut just right . It wasn't chopped up into little bits and it wasn't slices laying in there. It was just right, and we should all know what just right is\n\n I take my first bite , the juices from the meat and cheese mixed with that  Apple wood smoked bacon was amazing. The meat , not a single dry section, a great flavorful rush to it.  The way the Wiz and American held everything  in with the onions mixed all in there , this bad boy was phenomenal ! I didn't need ketchup , I wanted to enjoy all the flavors this had to offer. \n\nSo as I am in a \"Nom nom \" mode , my taste buds were getting a well deserved treat I am looking around this fine establishment. A nice old school décor to Sonny's showing pictures along the wall of how they did things back in the day. Great spot with plenty of seating in the back and along the wall. Clean with a great crew working their magic , with that said these guys are also open till 3 am. So get in there and get involved in something you'll be sure to come back again and again.  \n\nReview over, go there now! Immediately , stop reading and GO !",

Well in this case, it's really awesome. Or at least above average. I've been here about 2-3 times total mostly after hitting up Gateway Convention Center and I've had a pretty good time every single visit. Those cheddar biscuits might not be exactly the same as Red Lobster but at least they're lower in calories! (80 cal per biscuit.) The lobster tails are really good too and I like that you can order just one if that's all your feeling. Their drink menu is really what hit home for me...lots of different drink options plus \"skinny\" cocktail options. (God, I hate that term, \"skinny\"...what if you're limiting your calories because of a health reason, not because you want to be skinny? LOL.) But yeah they also have many non alcoholic drink options like the delicious strawberry lemonade with fizz.\nAlso I will mention while food generally comes out fast here, there have been one or two times when it did take a little while longer so don't come here if you're in a hurry, or if you are, call ahead and get it to go!",

Let's face it, you're a tourist, you're going to be hitting up the French Quarter and it's right there!  Give your tired feet a rest and come in and grab lunch!\n\n2) No matter how busy they are, you will be seated within 10 minutes.  It's like magic.  Really.\n\n3) The restaurant itself is cute, mildly romantic (without being saccrine or precious), and the service is generally great.\n\n4) The food isn't going to get any Michelin stars, but it's solid, basic, traditional Creole cuisine...and that's why you're visiting NOLA right?  To sample the Creole and Cajun cuisines!\n\n5) The Whiskey Bread Pudding.  I lied in #3...they MAY get a Michelin star for this.  I absolutely dislike sweets...and I want to make sweet sweet love to this dish.  My husband looooves sweets, and he wants to make sweet sweet love to this dish.\n\nNow a few key things -\n\nHave a bloody mary with your meal!  They make faaaaaabulous bloody marys here!  It doesn't matter that it's only 11am...you're in NOLA.  It's OK to drink before 5 :)\n\nIf you are a tourist, please try to be \"adventurous\" and put yourself in your server's hands.  Unless you have an honest to god food allergy (and a REAL allergy, not a fake allergy where it really is that you don't want to try something different), don't quiz the poor server for 30 minutes asking what all the ingredients in each dish is.\n\nIf the weather permits, ask to get a table in the courtyard (it's really pretty), or barring that, get a window seat and people watch!\n\nPersonally, I looove the gumbos here (hey it's called Gumbo Shop for a reason!), but my husband is a fan of their etouffees.  Either way, the food is solidly good and very reasonable price wise!\n\nBe nice to your server.  Everytime I've come (and I've come every time I visit NOLA - too numerous to count), I've had great service.  The servers have always been attentive and prompt (even when they are clearly overworked and tired), just be nice and you'll have a great time with great recommends (and on occasion, a few free refills on those delicious bloody marys)!\n\nAnd definitely have the bread pudding!  It's really amazing!",

I have eaten quite a few fried fish sandwiches in my day and this was the absolute best I've ever had! It wasn't very hot (spicy) and I don't care if it's not authentic a la \"hot chicken.\" This fillet was amazingly crispy on the outside, flaky and moist on the inside. It was a sizable piece of fish--the fish itself was clearly the star of the show: the balance of flavors considering the sauces and accoutrements was spot-on. I hate when the bun overshadows the fish due to proportions of the components, but this was not even close to being an issue at The Hook. I also take issue with a fish sandwich that deteriorates and gets mushy--NOT a problem at The Hook! The breading remained crispy and intact until it had been completely demolished.\n\nWe tried the Po Mi as well and while interesting and tasty, it isn't something I'd come back for. Chips and fries are top notch though, and I'd also order the slushy Pimms over and over.\n\nLoved the ambience. Loved the cocktails. Loved the fried fish.",

  "text": "Somehow we ended up going for custard while it was 29°F outside, which is probably not the optimal time to visit an outdoor frozen dessert stand.  But it was worth it to introduce a newbie to Ted Drewes and the world of midwestern custard.\n\nI always try to find out what foods/restaurants are special to locals in an area, and my MO friends swear by Ted Drewes.  So when a new colleague came with us on a business trip and said she didn't know the difference between ice cream and custard... we knew what needed to be done.\n\nThere's something about their custard that is the right combination of rich and creamy and flavorful.  I'm a sucker for a concrete (let's face it, plain custard is pretty boring), and they've got so many flavors to choose from!  It's all vanilla custard, but you barely notice once it's been mixed up with all sorts of toppings.  This time I got the Dutchman, because I love pecans and butterscotch.  It was soooo good, I almost forgot I was freezing (almost).\n\nA few things keep me from giving them the last star.  One: I really wish they also had chocolate.  I'm a chocoholic and some concretes would just be better with chocolate as the base.  Two:  I know the walk-up model is popular and classic, but I'd love more places to keep warm if they're going to serve custard in sub-freezing temps.  Three:  the smallest size concrete is still a lot of custard.  I'm not a cheapskate, I just don't want to eat an entire meal of custard.  Calling a size \"micro\" that's still like 12oz is laughable.  I threw out half of it and would rather have just not wasted that food.  \n\nThe lines move fast, and they've got lots of menus and signs posted so you can think about what you're going to order in advance.  They make everything pretty fast, too.",

Husband ordered ghost burger w fries I got cowboy ranch burger w salad. My salad was sizable but they short portioned his fries. He barely got any. When he Re-ordered a 2nd helping he barely got any the 2nd time and although the restaurant was 80% empty it took forever to get a refill on fries.\n\nRed Robin is falling out favor w me.

  "text": "Amerigo Italian Restaurant in Midtown is a casual dining experience with a comfortable and nice ambiance. They have a few locations in Tennessee and a couple in Mississippi as well although this is the only location I have visited. \n\nI've been here twice and both experiences have been good. Most recently I came here for a work lunch so they put us in a private room since there were so many of us. I'm always sympathetic for servers which have to take care of a large group but I think that our servers did a great job. They were quick to take our drink orders and get us situated. \n\nThrough my workplace they had arranged for each one of us to pick a salad, entree and dessert. I got a Cesar salad, the chicken acuto and the pecan butter crunch cake. I enjoyed everything that I ordered. If I had to pick a favorite it might be the pecan butter crunch cake. If you are going to get a dessert get this one! It is sinfully rich and decadent and almost tastes like a cheesecake. The Cesar salad didn't have an overwhelming amount of dressing like some places do which I was happy about and the croutons were tasty. The chicken acuto was actually a perfect serving of a grilled chicken breast with a side of black bean salsa and spicy olive oil. It's served with a grilled artichoke and green beans. Everything on the plate was delicious and other people at my table who ordered it agreed that it was a great dish. Most other people at my table got the lasagna which seemed to be a crowd pleaser as well. \n\nOverall I enjoy Amerigo and have had good meals and service here. It is a perfect place for us to go for work functions so I always look forward to us coming here.",

  "text": "We came here 5 years ago and actually didn't go inside cause the outside was a little iffy.  Tonight we went in because we got a take out/delivery menu at home and liked the looks of it so we thought we'd try going in person first.  We ordered a salad, a soup and four sushi rolls for dinner.  Two of the rolls were labeled as 'special' but they were rather uninspired compared to other sushi we've had in the area (and around the world).  \n\nThe decor was kind of boring, and the restaurant was empty for a Friday night (just us an one other couple).  \n\nI asked for tea but the food arrived before I asked again and they brought us lukewarm tea.  As for the regular sushi rolls, we had a spicy tuna with no spice and another roll that was a bit bland.\n\nOverall I think it's great to have a place that will deliver sushi to us when we don't want to go out, but if we're going out I think we'll stick to another place in town with a bit more creativity, ambiance and customers.",

I got the hottest level chicken strips, which were followed by a 5-minute panic attack before the heat subsided.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't think they fried the chicken fresh.  Maybe they just reheated it, because it came out suspiciously fast and was soggy, even though we ate it immediately.  Also, they were extremely stingy on the sauce, and they charged $3 for \"bottled water\" that was actually just tap water in a disposable cup. \n\nI would go back if I were dying for something spicy, because I just don't know where else I could go in this town.",

This was the very first thing we ate right after we landed in the wonderful city of NOLA.\n\nLocated right in the heart of Bourbon St and Bienville St, semi tucked away behind Musical Legends Park, came here for a late lunch. I order the Jambalaya and boyfriend ordered the Shrimp Bo'Boy sandwich. \n\nWhoever said the jambalaya portion was small must have a big appetite. The bowl was filled with never ending portions of Andouille sausages, chicken and rice. Poured some hot sauce in and it was a simple, yet great lunch! Portion is enough for two females to share. \nBoyfriend's shrimp bo'boy left a lot to be desired though. Bare minimum of shrimp....that was disappointing. He did like the horseradish sauce and his baguette was warm and soft.\n\nThe iced vanilla Au Lait was DELICIOUS!!!!!!! Great flavor and perfect amount of caffeine. Wish we had the chance to come back again, but only being here for a few days, I wanted to try as much restaurants and different local coffee shops as much as possible.",

The broth is light, full of chicken flavor and not over-salted.   All of the chicken dishes in white sauces (Moo Goo Gai Pan, chicken with mango, etc) and the moo-shoo are excellent.

At first, there was only 1 person serving everyone. when we entered there was only 1 table, and as we were there maybe another 2 or 3 tables came. id like to state we only ordered water and juice to drink, along with an app each. as we were waiting awhile for our drinks, the 2 new tables came. lets just say after 45 mins of waiting, the 2 new tables received their food..and then a 3rd starting getting their food. something was up and i didnt get it. our original server seemed to be ignoring us and not giving me any eye contact. I know i can be a bitch, but even my friend who is way more passive than me noticed the odd behavior. \n\neventually a new server entered the game, i brought up our issues to him. he was confused about what we ordered. we ordered crawfish rangoons and buns. everyone elses table fulled entrees came out. well he eventually had to put our orders in, it seemed the first server never did.\n\nback to the drinks, i ordered a drink and it was supposed to be housemade ginger soda. my first thought upon dirnking it was, wow this tastes like straight up lime! the second server asked me if i wanted another, then told me that they dont have ginger soda today, he offered a lime soda... said ahh thats why she gave me a random drink. i assumed she didnt even ask just gave it to me. he defended the original server and said, no the ginger beer has lime it it. im not crazy, i know my first drink was some type of lime soda..it just didnt have lime in it  - it was lime! anyway i didnt get the 2nd drink. the 2nd server probably heard me and my friend talking shit to eachother, he came over to us and apologized for the mix ups with the ordering process and thanked us for being patient. kudos to him. i appreciated that. there really seemed to be something up the first servers ass, not gonna lie, she seemed to be miserable and had an attitude. i think it was clear me and my friend were unhappy and i guess she eventually didnt wanna deal with us. \n\nmaybe we came on an off day, but it was odd...rude..and very confusing as to why all of this went down. \n\nso onto the good...\n\nthe place smelled amazing! these chefs know what theyre doing! you can see the kitchen and check out the spices and seasonings they use! my crawfish rangoon were amazing! i highly suggest getting them. to be honest, they dont need the amount of sauce it came with. my friends buns were to die for also.",

  "text": "Another great review.  Loved it.  Very subtle flavors, more sophisticated spice profile than the run-of-the-mill North Indian restaurants in the Northeast.\n\nOwners are very pleasant, and they are happy to accommodate even vegan requests.\n\nI had chana saag sans oil or cream at a high spice level, which was absolutely delicious.  \n\nThe roti and naan were good, as was the basmati rice, which had some saffron rice, as well.\n\nThe chicken tandoori was extremely tender, and juicy.  You could really taste the yogurt, for once.\n\nPalak paneer, I was told by my DP, was very good, although I did not try it.  I did not see the cubes of cheese, and cannot vouch whether or not they make it in house.  That'd be sweet if they did.\n\nPappadam was crisp and seedy, for lack of a better descriptor!\n\nAnother positive point was that they had our take-out order ready within 20 minutes, which is very fast.  They even do delivery, although we did not try that.\n\nThe only downside, and this is probably a function of their newness, is that the restaurant still has glimmers of the faux Mexican faire that used to occupy that same spot.  Garish yellows and turquoise tiles probably need to be removed.",

Everything is prepared fresh, so you might be waiting 15 minutes or more for a chicken parm sandwich, depending on how busy they are.  Just grab a seat nearby & wait for your number to be called & then enjoy (until you notice that the city of Philadelphia has put a surcharge on fountain drinks).",

  "text": "I've been to New Orleans many times and it took approximately six years to finally try the food here.  It was recommended to me by a few people and decided to give it a try on my next visit. \n\nIt smells so good coming in! That buttery, garlicky, smoky seafood awesome smell! This restaurant is located at the waterfront Hilton at the edge of the French quarter and business district. The restaurant itself is a lot larger than I would expect as it occupies almost the entire floor it's located on. There is a maze of seating everywhere! Now I can see why they didn't require reservations. We had the shrimp and grits and the charbroiled oysters which were amazing. \n\nThey have a relatively efficient wait-staff system, so the wait is not too long. They have probably gotten their flow of work mastered after being around for a few years. Our waiter was very helpful and friendly with us. Now that I have finally eaten here, I can definitely recommend this place to others. It's worth a stop by if you love seafood.",

After searching high and low for a good brunch place to end my trip to NOLA to see my friends, we found this place. It was close by and had good prices. We called to make a reservation for 10:30 am. Upon arriving we were asked to wait while they cleared our table, 45 min later we asked what the problem was since other tables without reservations were getting seated, the girl looked blankly at me and said \"oh you had a reservatio?\" noooooo, we just said that for giggles. Another 15 min later we were given a table. \n\nWe ordered a round of mimosas while we looked the menu over. After asking for our waitress a few times, she finally came over and took our orders. My friends had the eggs benedict, while I had the waffle with egg whites and turkey bacon. Our food got to the table COLD. Its disgusting, who likes cold eggs and waffles? We kindly asked the waitress if she could take it back to at least be put in a microwave and she gave us attitude saying \"we're packed, but ill see\" \n\nThe cook then came out to speak to us, he apologized and we said we understood they were slammed we just want hot food. He took back our food and gave us all papers to fill out to send us gift certificates which we found nice. That was until the manager, also his wife came and gave us an earful. Last time I checked, its not my fault your food is cold and you can't handle the crowd. We stayed to enjoy our mimosas when they sat a table of guys next to us who began talking to us. The manager comes over and tells us to STOP SOCIALIZING AND FINISH BC THEY NEED THE TABLE! I hav never been so mad and disrespected at a restaurant. Needless to say, I said a few choice words and left. \n\nIf you want a good dining experience and food go somewhere else. This place sucks.",

  "text": "Capdeville, you are working it. \n\nI promised I'd be back to give things another shot. I have a better idea of what the Capdeville concept is now, too: a laid-back pub-style place with a slamming kitchen and minimal table service. I think the point is to stretch out and relax instead of trying to wham, bam, thank you ma'am. \n\nSince my last visit, the kitchen is even more on-point. They were putting out dish after dish of fantastic looking food in a very reasonable amount of time. Everything I saw come out looked like it must enter my mouth NOW, even though it wasn't mine. I feel like the chef and his staff have really settled into their menu and know how to play. Of note is the artichoke bruschetta, which is always good. It's a little bit different from the rest of the city, with cubes of artichoke heart and shaved parmesan...but it works so well. \n\nThe noise level is still really out of control, but that's what happens when you have WOOD CEILINGS and drunk people. I have accepted that it will never change. (But really, some thick drapes on the windows would be so sexy, Capdeville! Get your girlfriend to arrange them artfully and admire how plush your space looks. Mmmmrawr!)\n\nMy main beef and the only reason this review crept up one star instead of two is the staffing complaint. No, it wasn't White Linen Night this time. It was Thursday. Our server took frequent smoke/sex/something breaks so we sat and sat and sat before we were greeted. Then we sat and sat and sat between courses. Then our food sat and sat and sat in the window. (This is the downside of making the transfer point visible.) Part of the problem was our server (who was clearly a magician); the other part seemed to be very rigid roles. The other server on the floor was rushed off his poor, hip little feet the entire night so he couldn't jump in...but the bartender spent a lot of time crossing his arms and looking moody. We were seated in the bar area so it would have been mighty convenient for the bartender to drop our food off instead of perfecting his perfect moody pout ...but none doing. And more than once, the servers ended up behind the bar, making drinks while the bartender \"worked the crowd.\" It's not comforting to see a server make a mixed drink when the bartender can't bother to deliver a plate. \n\nI'll give Capdeville a few more chances because the kitchen is so right on, and the atmosphere is fun; but the service has the potential to turn me off from an otherwise lovely place. \n\nAccessibility notes: Fully accessible for mobility devices of all sorts. Very dim and no braille signage or menu. Extremely loud for hard-of-hearing customers. Outdoor tables may solve problems of light and sound.",

So when I moved to Tampa almost 2 years ago I went on a search to find the city's best Dim Sum... sadly, it's not here. After reading great reviews, I decided to give it a try and to say that I was unimpressed is a huge understatement. I even ate here twice to be sure.\n\nThe best thing about the restaurant was not the food. The decor was classy, the atmosphere was welcoming, and service was good, but the focus should most certainly be the food. The food was bland and seemed to be the furthest thing from fresh. It was an absolute disappointment. Not to mention that they only had 2 carts, which is no where near sufficient for the kind of spread a proper Dim Sum restaurant should have. In a nutshell- it's over-priced and poor quality with a lacking menu.\n\nThey say \"Third time's a charm\" but I'll never know because I don't intend on wasting my time or money on another disappointing meal. If I'm going to waste my time and money, I'd rather do it driving around the entire Tampa Bay area to find a better Dim Sum place.",

On top of that, the fries weren't even anything special--I'd much rather have McDonalds or In N Out's. Further, the parmesan tasted disgustingly stale.

It was refreshing and tasty without being too sweet. Later, I had a glass of the Malvira Arneis, which lived up to the description of fresh and mineral. I checked out the space, which is very open with exposed brick and a modern but intentionally worn feel. They definitely hit the mark with the aesthetic.\n\nFor food, we started with the kohlrabi (spiraled) with Caesar dressing, croutons, sheep cheese, and trout roe. I made sure to eat every last fish egg, they were so delicious. This was actually my favorite dish of the night. It was unique; I've never have kohlrabi prepared this way, and the pairing of the roe was exquisite. \n\nFor our main, we shared the Heritage pork shoulder. I was expecting a much more substantial serving of meat, considering this was $23 without any sides. We were somewhat disappointed when two slices of meat came out- there weren't many bites to be had. That said, it was really good. Cooked perfectly, tasty sauce. \n\nWe also shared the tomato, mozzarella, basil, and parmesan pizza. They have a brick oven to fire up the pizzas, so the crust was crisp and had that mildly charred flavor that takes pizza to the next level. They have other pizzas with more interesting toppings, but my husband isn't a fan of white pizzas, so we went basic here. We enjoyed it very much. \n\nIn short, the fare is fantastic, though a bit on the expensive side for the portions. I recommend this place for a special treat when you want to celebrate.",

There was an instinctive feeling I wanted to get out asap, so I told him a Bowl of Gumbo to start and I'll go from there.\n\nWaiter arrived with warm French Bread.\n\nSeafood Okra Gumbo($7.99)\n\nOkra, Onions, Bell Peppers, Celery and a tiny bit of Tomato sauteed and blended with Shrimp and Crabs into a thick, brown Creole soup-served over Rice.\n\nSoups up, I sipped the soup and it reminds me of my dorm years.  I recognize that flavour anywhere because I grew up from it, the taste of Campbell's Chunky brand Beef base.  At least I know there's Okra in it because of the slimey consistency in every spoonful.  Shrimps were like tasting rehydrated Dried Shrimps while the Blue Crab had similar characteristics.\n\nIt's one of those dishes that makes you want to stop.  Needless to say, I didn't order anything else.  It didn't help there was New Orlean-style Flies freely helping themselves with my Meal, and I was sitted indoors rather than the back Patio.\n\nMemorable but not a good way, at least for this one-visit customer.\nSearch for tasty, flavourful, Gumbo continues....",

Mr. Dunderbak's has a variety of delicious brews on tap and an adequate food menu.  Additionally, there's a wall of chocolate close to the counter.  \n\nWhile I appreciated the variety of craft brews, one of my favorite beers was not up to par the day I ordered it.  The Brooklyn Brewery Cuvee de Cardoz was not carbonated correctly.  It could have happened for a variety of reasons (keg tapped too long, bad keg to begin with, or under carbonated at the Brewery), which is not to be blamed on Mr. Dunderbak's.  \n\nI also ordered the lox (smoked salmon with cream cheese on a bagel), which was just okay.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't wonderful.  It was just okay.  The hot German potato salad was also a little more sour and soupy than I would have preferred.  The Matterhorn on the other hand was quite tasty and rather large for the price.  Piled high with meat on a toasty bread, it is perfect for soaking up heavy beers. \n\nDespite the semi-flat beer, I really like this place.  Five stars for the beer variety and big sammiches!",

I came here on a busy Saturday for lunch with my family; the place was packed, but we were able to be seated right away. We ordered the beef scallion pancake, pork soup dumplings, Taiwanese beef noodle soup, and crispy salted chicken. The dishes came quickly and were all delicious. The soup dumplings in particular had a thin, delicate skin and plenty of hot flavorful soup inside. Definitely the best in Chinatown!

  "text": "I have to say that Zeppoli was very good and I would like to come back and try a few more things.  We arrived a bit early for a Monday night reservation and we were sat immediately.  We started by ordering the salad and the app special which were lamb chops.  The lamb chops were perfectly cooked and came with a slice of cooked eggplant and the 2 went very well together.  Moving on we ordered the Gnocchi which were good but they didn't really wow us so next time I would like to branch out and try another pasta.  For dinner, we ordered the Marinated Rib-Eye which was bone in but they cut the bone out for you and place it on a separate plate and the Fisherman's Stew.  The Fisherman's Stew was just fantastic, everything went extremely well together and the broth wasn't too acidic which does happen sometimes.  I was gnawing on that steak bone for a while as well.  We did order some sorbet and ice cream for dessert and it was very good.  Overall besides the misstep that was the gnocchi this was a solid meal and I look forward to returning and seeing what they have in the future.",

Seriously, if you're a chicken salad fan, this is a must have when you're in STL! My mom which is very critical when it comes to food loves it too! Only downfall is that it's a little pricy! \n\nI also love their Thai pasta salad! It taste so good! Has water chestnuts and celery for the crunch! Something about this pasta salad makes me come back for more and I'm not a pasta person at all! Everything that is in the pasta is very flavorful. Looks so simple to mimic the recipe but I just rather purchase from straub's. \n\nThe curry chicken salad is also great! Made just like the original but curry style! A little sweeter but still prefer the original. \n\nThis little grocery store also sells a lot of small business goodies such as Ann & Allen's gooey butter cake. labonne bouchee goodies, sia's Italian ice and much more. Since this is a privately own grocery store it can be a little pricy but it gets plenty of business regardless!",

Great beers on tap, Steve Earle music playing, and a good vibe among the people there. I loved that they even had a \"pub menu,\" and you were also able to bring in lunch from the store to eat in there.\n\nMy husband and I ended up doing a few beer flights, which was the perfect way to sample all of the beers we wanted to try. My husband fell in love with one and brought it home in a Growler, which I had never heard of before, but doesn't make as much noise as one may think.\n\nI think the new Tap Room is a great addition to the Reno community. It's not as much of a happy hour vibe as some of the newer Midtown bars, but the staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and it's a great place to relax while you're writing down your grocery list. And after a few drinks, that list may have evolved into something like potato chips, hot dogs, guacamole, and chocolate bars. Thank goodness you're at Whole Foods, where you can get the best caliber of all 4 of those items.\n\nEnjoy!",

But, there are some pretty slammin' views if you score a table by the window or dine on the patio. \n\nThe atmosphere is semi-fancy (or maybe everyone was just dressed a little fancier for New Years), with a nice open space and a cool bar. Service was pretty good; everyone was really nice and welcoming, with just a slight snafu with our waiter not being completely sure what a gluten allergy entails. \n\nWe came here for New Years Eve dinner, which had a pre fixe menu with an optional wine pairing addition. It started with a Manchego plate, that came with marcona almonds (my favorite), bread, and amazing local honey that I now want to slather on all of my meals. Next, we had the ibérico mixto and piquillos rellenos. The iberico plate was good, but nothing mind-blowing. The piquillos rellenos were pretty disappointing; I love shrimp but they tasted heavily of cream cheese, and the random small chunks of shrimp had kind of a weird texture. For the main course, we elected the cabrillo and the lomo. The cabrillo was really good, but the lomo was far and away my favorite thing of the night. It was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and the potato puree and broccolini paired perfectly with the tenderloin. \n\nAll in all, I think Contigo was pretty good. I don't know that I'd go far out of my way to revisit necessarily, but sure wouldn't mind if I was already in the area. Though those Paella Tuesdays are pretty tempting...",

It's literally at the back of a bar through a space that looks like you're entering a bathroom. Its a very small space where the air is filled with the smell of deliciousness and there are only a few seats. I was pretty pumped for this...\n\nI got the Dark & Stormy Po boy which is Pork Belly with Rum Ginger Glaze with Lime Slaw, Garlic Aioli. After about 20 minutes the sandwich came out and it looks delicious. Upon taking a bite the problem was immediately evident. There was practically no meat in the sandwich. The meat that was actually in there was good, but it was literally buried in the slaw, glaze and aioli. With eat bite, I tasted only bread and toppings with the occasional small piece of meat. It was to the point decided to put all the meat on half a piece of bread and eat it that way just so I could get a real feel for it. Once i did this, it tasted good, but was still overkill on the toppings.\n\nThis is a bit of a weird situation. Everything about this place screams classic, but the way my sandwich was constructed made it impossible to really enjoy. Based on the reviews, maybe my sandwich was a one off situation. Either way, I only ended up eating a little over 1/4 of the sandwich because of the lack of meat... Which was obviously frustrating.",

  "text": "If you want to experience one of the nation's great urban parks, try the perimeter bike path, which is a bit more than five miles in length, I believe. Along the way, you'll find a world-class zoo and art museum, Missouri history museum, \"Muny\" outdoor theater, ponds, pools, fountains, gardens, golf course, and tennis courts. West of the park is Wash U. and the Delmar Loop, and east is the Central West End (CWE).  Be careful that you don't crash on a downhill; but if you do, you're within sight of Barnes-Jewish Medical Center, one of the best in the nation.  Bikes and \"Segways\" are available for rental (inquire at Lindell Pavilion, where you'll find coffee and public restrooms). Suburbanites like me can just load up the bikerack on the SUV, and park north-central, or many places around the interior. Sadly, I can share stories, one personal, of \"smash-and-grab\" car burglaries in parking areas. It's best to take all electronics and valuables with you.",

  "text": "A very nice public park that has been getting increasing traffic and varied events.   One of the major outdoor concert venues with plenty of nearby paid parking options.  View is great across the river from the signature minarets at University of Tampa.  The playground and water-spray park is popular with the kids and convenient to the Children's Museum.  Kids and parents are frequent visitors, mixing with local street folks charging their cells on the free outdoor electrical outlets.  Well patrolled by law enforcement so  trouble is unlikely. Very attentive maintenance crew.\n\nMost of the space is wide open but conducive to tents, so it can accommodate lots of events, including some connected with the Republican National Convention, Movies on the Lawn, ice skating, and the annual St. Vincent de Paul \"Walk for the Poor\" complete with the Starship Yacht docked at the seawall to serve as food and beverage source.",

Convenient spot to grab and munch on. \n\nI liked the onion rings as a side order a lot!  They batter it up well and fried it to a perfect crispiness, that was delicious.  It was the crunch that was overly satisfying with my mustard dip. \n\nCherry hot pickled peppers, complimented the sammie!  I had a bite of that with every bite of the sammie!  I was indulging.  The pleasures of simplicity on grub local food with travel, was what this spot reminded me of in that moment.  It was treasurable and marked a satisfactory spot in my soul. \n\nClassic Philly sammie that one can't go wrong on when ordering up here! Add the onion rings while at it!  Win!",

  "text": "Please read my last review!!     I went on and on about all the previous five star and one star reviews and whether or not they were sincere.   I had a lot of messages and comments some supporting my views and others challenging them (to say it nicely)   \n\nMy friend Lily had a higher opinion of it than I did and we thought it would be fun to revisit the restaurant together.    Lily is my expert in Chinese cuisine and she ordered off of the Chinese menu.    Things I would never even know exist!!   \n\nI have to say that I was quite impressed by the food!   The portions were generous for the money, very different than my first experience.   The taste was very, very good and while it isn't Lily's favorite Chinese restaurant in the area, I think she enjoyed it as well.    \n\nThat said, the restaurant has SO much farther that it needs to go.  It was complete amateur hour when we were there.   The ordering was awkward and slow, two of the four dishes that we ordered were wrong and had to be sent back.   It was a meal of explanations,  arguments and apologies.    \n\nI want to say that it is OK that the place has no atmosphere whatsoever because it is in I.V.  But why shouldn't it be a more visually pleasant dining experience.   As I mentioned in my first review Wok had an almost entirely Chinese clientele which I think says volumes about the authenticity of the food.    \n\nOk there you have it, my previous one star review is now a two star.   Come on Wok, it won't take too much to get me up to three stars!   The food is already there!",

  "text": "I work with a lot of guys who used to work at Sewell Cadillac. It was before my time, but I felt like I knew the place because of all of the stories I've heard. Thus, even though it's a little out of my way (I live on the Westbank), I decided to stop by and check out the new Rouses located in the old Sewell building.\n\nI wondered how they would transform it from a car dealership to a supermarket. The place looks fabulous, and the parking garage is really convenient. Be sure to drive to the top for a nice view of the Crescent City Connection bridge. \n\nAlso, it might be a good idea to grab a map when you first walk in the door. I saw the maps, but neglected to do so. Really, who needs a map for a grocery store? You'll think this, like I did, but then you'll freak out when you can't find the produce section. It's more than a little confusing. \n\nOnce you manage to navigate the store, though, you'll find a good selection of great products. Everything is high quality, like you would expect at Rouses. I need to come back here at least once more, on an empty stomach, and check out the prepared foods. I almost gave in and got a cup of King Cake Gelato on my way out... but resisted. This time. Next time I think I'll go for it :)",

  "text": "I've been twice, once before their grand opening with a group of 6 and once last week with a slightly smaller party. My friends were more impressed than I was (I would say really more like 3.5 stars).\n\nThe atmosphere is nice, albeit a little bit more upscale and a little bit less fun/cool than my main restaurants of comparison (Bakersfield, primarily). All of the light fixtures are super lovely. The bathrooms are actually the prettiest bathrooms I've ever seen. That wallpaper (*insert heart eye emoji here*)! I don't like the half circle tables for larger groups. I could barely hear the people who weren't sitting next to me because we were basically sitting in a line.\n\nI've had the guacamole (with crudite, jicama, etc.), queso (with black bean puree at the bottom), fried avocado tacos, and fish tacos. Mix up your queso, it's great with the crispy, warm chips. Fish tacos were too fishy for my liking. The fried avocados are crispy and flavorful, but the amount of food in the tortillas were a little sparse my second time there. I would say this is probably inventive food for Indianapolis, but coming from Houston, it's pretty standard (except maybe the taco with mashed potatoes!).  (Side note: If you love Nada's avocado tacos, you will FLIP for Torchy's in Texas.) Prices are decent for food. I had two of the draft cocktails - not impressed by the margarita (Bakersfield's is WAY better, gotta say), but the Mexican Mule was pretty tasty. It was the perfect amount of sweet and refreshing.\n\nService improved for the second visit. The first visit, our waters only got refilled after multiple requests. They brought my friend the wrong drink. They brought my friend's pork belly tacos without egg (even after a long discussion about it with the waiter!). They gave us the wrong leftovers (pork to the vegetarian, kind of a bummer).",

The last thing I remember eating there was years ago (after it moved to Neil Rd) and it was the garlic cheese bread, which I remember being SO BOM! \n\nMe and my uncle, who BACHING it, while my aunt is on a trip, decided to get dinner, he said pizza, and I thought heck, let's do Semenza's, it's got good reviews, and I keep hearing about the amazing chicken wings, and I always think about that cheese bread, so we went a two days ago on Thursday night. \n\nAs you know it's on Neil Road, which when I was growing up, was the gang street, not sure if it still has that rep, but, upon arriving, I felt very unwelcomed. A guy was at the register taking an order and it was taking a while, me and uncle had decided on a medium special which was a 2 topping pizza and 1 1/2LBs of wings for mid $20 range. \n\nAfter taking the ladies order, he just walks away, no greeting, no communication, I was going to walk out and would have if Todd South didn't tell me a personal story about the owner, I figured this guy wasn't him, and that was the only saving grace. Another guy comes over, and he takes our order, so we ordered, even after the blatant customer disrespect, I asked if he was the owner, which he confirmed. \n\nI then ordered a pitcher of Bud Light beer (no Coors Light) and the famous cheese bread. He said they ran out of bread, so I didn't get the one thing I really wanted! \n\nOur food comes out in a reasonable amount of time, and I can say it was not impressive, neither the pizza or the wings. The wings were not super big either. I thought everything was okay that night, but I don't ever see myself eating pizza or wings there again. I had high expectations from Yelp, so I really expected them to deliver something memorable on the pizza and wings, this was just okay food, not horrible, not exciting, hence my 2 stars. \n\nThe pluses were an employee there, not the owner, was a good friendly personality, I appreciated him, and the pitcher was a good size for $12. Last, but not lease, I ordered my pizza well done, and this pizza was a far cry from well done when the nice guy dropped the pizza, I did confirm, if this was well done which he said it was, it was definitely not!",

At the end of the day, food was amazing, and all of our guests were pretty happy - but they were TIRED from how late into the night we had to wait for our food.

Food again was great, servers were kind, but again, very slow to refill our drinks/take our check/etc. \n\nOverall, this place is great. Ambiance, decor, and food are amazing.

The tortilla was way overcooked and flavorless. I was also surprised that the meal didn't come with sides. \n\nI got a sangria and hubby got a margarita. Neither of them were good enough to have us wanting more. \n\nYes, the decor is cute but that's not enough to keep us coming back unfortunately.",

  "text": "So my wife and I tried to come here two Friday's ago at 4:15 pm before a benefit to grab some grub and were told at the side door that they don't open until 5 pm. Really? Five o'clock on a Friday...whatever. So we went back this past Friday at 5. I've go to say that they have a great happy hour, $3 drafts, $4 house margaritas, and $4 nachos. We sat at the bar and my wife had a margarita and I a PBC Harvest From the Hood. Her drink was tasty and seemed like it was the real deal and not a premade mix. Atmosphere was cool and the bathrooms were bright, clean and the Spanish comic book wallpaper with the buxom women was totally fun. Perused the menu and started with the Nachos de Kezo. Carne Asada, Pulled Chicken and Chorizo and Potatoes loaded on to delicious chips with melted cheese, Crema and Guacamole. Holy cow they were awesome. The bartender told us they also make them as Nachos De K & A but use waffle fries instead of chips. We will definitely try them next time. Then onto the tacos. We ordered the fish and the shrimp tacos. Yes they were small but they are only $2-$2.50. The ingredients were well prepared but it seemed like they needed some seasoning somewhere along the line. Both were a little bland but coked perfectly. A little salt can go a long way. Maybe that's why they give you 4 to 5 different sauces in a little bucket with your order. Overall we enjoyed the chill vibe and the nachos but thought the tacos were a little lacking in the flavor department. We will give this one another try.",

Good for them!  They deserved the break.\n\nThat said, it was thanks to their closing that I discovered my NEW go-to Viet joint around these parts.  Cozy dining area, comprehensive menu and great prices.\n\nYesterday we came for breakfast - today; for lunch.  We were five and while I was tempted to go with the clams in oyster sauce (chef specialties menu) our server recommended the filet and vegetables.  Who am I to argue with a good recommendation.\n\nTwo house special Pho, one Shrimp fried rice, on Bo Kho and my filet/veg thingy.  The Pho broth was sublime.\n\nAll quite tasty.\n\nRegardless, next time I'll put my foot down and definitely order the clam dish.  It just sounds good, and what's more - I've had my fill of Bo Kho over the past month!\n\nStrongly recommend anyone who tends towards viet cuisine to check this out.  No disappointment anticipated.",

  "text": "I've always liked TBBC, but it's a bit of a hassle driving into Ybor (coming from Clearwater), so I'm glad they opened another location. The drive isn't much closer for me, but avoiding driving through \"malfunction junction\" is always a plus.\n\nThis new location is spacious and brighter. I love the bar that's made out of a trunk of a tree; the natural curves it has. There's a very spacious patio area, but not with much shades so it can be very sunny and hot. We've always chosen to sit at the inside bar. Bar = faster access to drinks & more drinking than eating. Don't judge.\n\nI've enjoyed several brews by TBBC and they all have been good (barleywine, hefeweizen, blonde ale and kumquat fruit ale). There is also a full liquor bar, which I haven't taken advantage of. The servers at the bar have always been great. They're so attentive; never let your glass go empty.\n\nAs for the food, I've only had 2 dishes so far: Cantonese Calamari and Calzone. The calamari was soooo good the first time, but not so great the 2nd due to the fried coating being mushy in the sauce. But this dish is so good, it's definitely worth more tries. The calzone looked impressive, but it wasn't as good as I had thought. I guess it's a TBBC signature thing because the side that's up is really puffed up. It looks huge, but it's all air inside. We got pepperoni and banana peppers toppings, but I can barely see either. Once you crack the plate size calzone open, there's just mostly air and lots and lots of cheese.\n\nJust last week TBBC changed its menu slightly and I noticed a pork belly appetizer was added. Can't wait to go back next week to try it.",

We both decided to share everything, the whole meal. We kicked it off with \"a plastic chair in the rose garden\" and \"the art of eight limbs.\" Both were delicious, but I was feeling partial to gin last night, so I enjoyed the rose garden a little more. You come here to eat, though. The freaking food! We started out with the gyoza, which was plated in the most vibrant way and they were phenomenal. Then we shared the issan himachi, it was approachable and filling. We finished with the shrimp toast, which was so balanced and then had a little flare with its kick. So good. There were so many more things to try, but no more room in our bellies. \n\nLast note, don't miss the restrooms and their fun whimsical art. \n\nUntil next time!",

Some FWB couples smoke a cig, we get pancakes.\n\nIt's legit. I do like the atmosphere. It's clean. It's a \"down home cookin'\" looking sort of place. It kind of looks like some of the places you'd find out in Colorado. Lodge looking, ya know? I like it. The waitresses are pretty meh. Hit or miss. There's one waitress I ADORE who has to be like, 70, and she dyes her hair blond and wears big obnoxious pink bows but she is sweet as cherry pie and incredibly quick and efficient. And actually seems to care about her customers. A couple others aren't bad. The rest couldn't give two craps about you. They have attitude. Look tired and can't be arsed to be there. Ex-bf explained it best: \"I think the waitresses here are in a prison work program.\" Yeah...looking around I could totally see some of these chicks having spent time in the slammer, and this is their first job since entering the halfway house. You really have to be there to know what I'm talking about. You'd be able to pick them out. But who knows.\n\nAll I know is that service is typically slow and apathetic for us. Eh. \n\nFood is pretty good, but I've only really ever gotten pancakes, and my biggest gripe is that they only have maple syrup. So if you get the strawberry pancakes, there is some strawberry glaze on it, so that's okay. But my apple pancakes this morning were full of apple chunks but not enough glaze, and I wasn't about to taint them with the wrong flavored syrup, so they were kinda dry. Hate to say it, Uncle Bills, but take a hint from IHOP. If you're gonna have multiple flavored pancakes, follow through with the syrup. Jus' sayin'.\n\nIf you're out in West Co and craving breakfast food at an odd hour and don't want to go somewhere commercial, go here\n\n(There is also one 2 minutes from me, but I've only been there once. The Kingshighway one actually doesn't seem to have as much on its menu. But it's fine. Gets the job done.

The sprite and coke tasted weird to us....\n\nThere were 6 of us from age 3-53 and we each found things on the menu that we wanted to try. We had Naan as an appetizer, it came with 2 sauces and everyone agreed that it was tasty.\nThe little ones ordered white rice, and the garden salad. The salad was supposed to be tomatoes, carrots and cucumbers....they substituted cabbage for the cucumbers. I asked about the cucumbers and they said they were out but there would be no charge for salad. \nThe rest of the dishes were delicious! We had lamb and chicken dishes. All dishes were spicy but we expected that. The mango chicken is mild if you are looking for something less spicy. I wanted a vegi dish so I tried the Gobi Manchurian and let me tell you, my mouth was on fire!!!\nFor dessert we wanted Kulfi (Indian style icecream) but they were out. We tried the Kheer (rice pudding) and it was ok. We also tried Gulab Jamun (milk balls in rose syrup) they are not something we would order again but it was fun to try new things.",

I don't have much time, so something quick would be awesome. I don't feel like anything too fancy, so something casual and cheap would be nice. Perhaps the deity of your choosing would send me a sign and guide me to a place that satisfies these requirements. I look up as the bus doors close behind me and hear a cherubic swell of harmony as a beam of light from the heavens illuminates the sign of none other than Qdoba.\n\nTurns out I was being guided by the Greek god of mediocrity. My steak burrito was was adequate, not a hecatomb (in the most classical sense) of meat, but enough. Not the ambrosia of the gods, but worth the $6 dollars I paid for it.\n\nMy main issue, the factor that decreases my rating from a kingly 3 stars to a meager 2, is the fact that they sell a number of drinks in plastic bottles yet have no recycling bin. For shame, Qdoba.",

Not to mention, the service was spectacular. Our waiter was very attentive without being bothersome.\n\nI had the Benny! Benny! Benny! - essentially a sampler for eggs benedicts. This is a HUGE portion so definitely only order if you have the appetite. My favorite Benny was definitely the one with the ham. If I could order again, I would just get the regular ham Benedict rather than this sampler.",

This place was directly on our route home so worked out perfectly that way. I couldn't believe that we had found a place that offered such a unique and fun menu! My husband was initially drawn to the ice cream nachos and all the spiked flavors. Whereas I was excited just to have some good flavors to try.\n\nUpon arrival, we were surprised to see that this window service ice cream shop, was actually part of a larger bar and Grill called splitz, I believe. Pretty cool! Also, it was huge! It even had a nice looking covered patio. If we stopped again, I totally be game to grab lunch before hand!\n\nBack to the ice cream. My husband loved the bourbon butter pecan. I did a flight of four flavors and one of my very favorites was one of their seasonal flavors, French toast! It had awesome flavor and I really loved the chunks of French toast in it? I also really enjoyed the peanut butter flavor!\n\nI noticed that they had a sale on their pints as well, so we grabbed one to go. It was the perfect thing to bring home to my dad who had been watching the kids all weekend. The flavor was caramel popcorn. Fingers crossed he lets me try a bite! LOL",

Never hearing of it before, i was a bit skeptical when Chinese was brought up for dinner, but coming from this gal, i should've known better. I am ashamed to have even had a spec of doubt about it. That little concern quickly vanished. As soon as you hit the door, it hits you. The aromas had me tasting the air because i was convinced something would come of it.\n\nThey've got the fully open kitchen space, which i really like to see in restaurants. I marvel at the mechanics of how some kitchens are ran at times. Plus an open kitchen typically means a very clean one, especially in newer joints. The lighting is really dim in here, like a click or two too dim. It took a minute for my eyes to adjust, but once my eyes and i were in agreement, the brain had to jump in and demonstrate some restraint because everything on the menu looked like a winner.\n\nWe were in a group of seven and top to bottom we ordered: \n\nThe South Lake Porridge which tasted better than it smelled, i added a little Sriracha and it was cool. But my least favorite of everything.\n\n(2) Craw Ragoon, which were very tasty, especially used in the mustard sauce.\n\nThe ginger scallion noodles which were also really good, i'd go for those again. \n\nGeneral lee's chicken, which was my favorite but a strong second is the Kung Pao Pastrami, trust me, get both of those dishes when you come here you will be in amazement at how good they are.\n\nThe Bywater eggplant which we were worried would be too spicy because of the reviews, but they were perfect.\n\nA couple rounds of drinks and the Chinese donut for dessert, and between seven people we were all full and the tab was only $170!\n\nBut let me get back to that chicken tho. My god, you can see the flavor in it once the dish hits your table, it has this glow, almost like that perfect plate of food on commercials, except in real life. Peanuts are a part of this dish, so if you have allergies, you may want to ask them to hold off on those, but for real goodness's sake, i hope you don't and can experience this dish as it is intended.\n\nI am going back, second night in a row for that chicken. The menu changes daily so be sure to check the website or call before ordering if you're unsure as to what they're offering. Pick up and Delivery available, but do note they add .25 per dish for pickup and delivery.\n\nNicely done, i'm with it.",

  "text": "I didn't try the sandwiches right after I purchased them, so my review may not be the most accurate. Since I had a few hours layover before my next flight, I decided to pull a crazy stunt and take the bus to Terminal F and check out Tony Luke's. The least amount of time it'll take to go back and forth between Terminal F is probably an hour- the bus ride over takes 10-15 minutes each way, then you have to order and wait for your food, and catch the next bus that comes. Also, it'll take 10-15 minutes to get your sandwich at Tony Luke's, even though the line isn't that long. I decided to try:\n\n-Junior Italian Roast Pork (w/Sharp Provolone, Broccoli Rabe, $7.59, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tony-lukes-philadelphia-6?select=GB5t3XxaxRhk0IGYfW12TQ#GB5t3XxaxRhk0IGYfW12TQ): Eh, just ok. The pork was really salty, and it got a little soggy from the broccoli rabe, so not even popping it in the toasted oven helped. If you order this, I don't think provolone is the way to go. I would give this another try but eat it right away.\n-Traditional Cheesesteak (w/Mild Provolone, $8.49, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tony-lukes-philadelphia-6?select=GB5t3XxaxRhk0IGYfW12TQ#5wQKfJkavtj6wcFMPFsyFA): I opted for provolone vs. whiz so it wouldn't get soggy, and I think I would've enjoyed this much more with the whiz. However, the bread was good, as was the steak, and I would order this again.\n\nI didn't think that the cheesesteak or roast pork from Tony Luke's was amazing, and better than other cheesesteaks I've had in Philly. However, since I didn't eat the sandwiches right away, I'll have to hold off on my final opinion until then.",

We had originally booked our swamp tour with Dr. something or other and they were horrible so we jumped ship (no pun intended) and booked with Cajun Encounters. I am so glad that we did! \n\nWe opted to take the bus from NOLA and was glad that we did. Our driver was so-so and he attempted to give us a tour from town out to the dock but sadly it was lacking (this is why I am deducting half a star...you will see why the other half star deduction...just keep reading). I think there was a language barrier and that kind of sucked. Oh, and he was 30 minutes late. That was a little frustrating. We took the first tour so this meant I could have spent an extra 30 minutes sleeping. Boo!\n\nOnce we got there we checked in and it was rather chaotic (the other half star deduction). You walk in and see a long line for tickets. The bad thing was that it is in the center of the gift shop. That made shopping rather difficult. This is probably not a good thing for revenue. The dumb this was that there was a register in the back...which was closed! \n\nThe tour itself was great! Our guide was friendly and very knowledgeable. I really enjoyed him. He gave us a history of the swamp and offered tons of info about the elusive gators of the bayou. We saw a number of them and even got to hold a baby. How awesome is that? Let me tell you, it was pretty darn awesome! I highly recommend that you request a covered boat. The poor people with the open boat were sweating like you couldn't believe. I thought it was very interesting that we did not encounter one mosquito! Amazing! \n\nOverall, I highly recommend this tour! If we travel back to NOLA we will definitely be back!",

  "text": "I've been wanting to try The BAO since it opened. They did a nice job on the remodel and the space is dimly lit, sparse, and kind of sexy. There was a single TV behind the bar and I think it was intentionally black & white. During my time there the movies on the screen were Little Shop of Horrors and Ferris Bueller's Day Off. These are two movies I could sit and watch in black & white with no sound forever. I met a friend for an early weekday dinner and neither of us were that hungry so we decided to share the Taiwanese Dumplings and the Soft Shell Crab Bao. The Taiwanese Dumplings are filled with chicken and vegetables and come with a soy scallion dipping sauce. They were very well cooked and had lots of nice crispy edges. My dinner date isn't an Asiaphile, as I am, and doesn't eat quite as many dumplings as I do. She thought they were the best she'd ever had and I thought they were just the best I had this week. The bao was actually a clever concept to make into an expensive designer sandwich. The bun has a slight sweetness and a good chew from being steamed and really holds up as a sandwich bun. The soft shell crab was good albeit slightly heavy on the breading. They do not include any kind of side dish with the bao. I felt they could at least put something a little colorful on the plate even as an afterthought but that was just my opinion. The cocktail menu was quite inventive and intricate but I'm not much of a drinker. All in all The BAO is clever and pretty well executed for a designer sandwich restaurant with an Asian twist in Clayton.",

The thing is it is a little bit more of a walk on cold days from my hotel than other stores.\nHowever, Once you get there it is worth the walk.\n This is a large Grocery store,complete with everything you could ever want.\n\nIt even has a lovely little cafe inside for food and drink.\nThe thing that I have found the best is the cosmetic section.\nWhich of course is the shampoo and lotions and such.\nI needed some important items and every where else was so high priced.\nI do not have a Save-on card(which gives discounts) but, the lovely lady in front of me in line allowed me to use hers.\nThat was so very good of her!\n\nThey have a pharmacy ,as well as a huge cheese and deli selection and bakery.\nThey do not charge you for your bags so that is awesome as well.\nI could of gone crazy buying all sorts of things.\nBut, then you have to carry them all back your hotel.\nGreat place to come to for your needs when you are downtown ED.",

I sat at the bar while my table was being prepared and stuck up a conversation with the amazing bartender Lou. She was so hospitable and showed me different jazz places. \n\nOnce I was seated for dinner I felt like I had stepped back into an older time of dining without any rush. The waiters there took care of everyone attentively. There was never a moment where I was waiting on them to come back. I also didn't feel like they didn't allow me Space. There was a nice balance to it all. \n\nI started off with their fresh hot bread and a Vietnamese soup dumpling they served complimentary. The duck was just delicious and for dessert I had to get the bananas fosters since it was created there and is a table side dessert. Worth it!",

Also, the specialty cocktails are just $5...and the basil lemonade one was amazing!!! Also, the avocado fries were sooo good, never had them before, but can't wait to try them again. Plus the chicken tenders were some of the lightest and moistest...ever! They were not super greasy or covered in yucky bread coating. Loved them. Although the french and honey mustard dipping sauces were pretty terrible, the BBQ was great. Wasn't too much of a fan of the edamame because it was swimming in beer juice, so it wasn't as dry and salty as I like. The place got PACKED around 5:30-6 so make sure to get there early to grab a table. Plus, a great crowd of younger professionals, and they have big TVs for the sports liking people.\n\nPS. There is also a row of unisex bathrooms which is kinda unqiue!",

I understand why they require dinner reservations and a limited seating time frame; there's likely always a wait for folks to get in.  But once we were there, we didn't feel rushed at all by our server.  In fact, the pacing of our drinks/food arriving was relaxed. \n\nGiven that a food order is required for seating, I was worried about the food quality, but we really enjoyed all the items we tried.  In fact, my two companions said it was their favorite meal while in New Orleans.  The atmosphere is lively and the musicians (Royal Street Windin' Boys) were outstanding; in general our 1.5 hours here was an awesome start to a great evening enjoying the music on Frenchmen Street.\n\nThe Food:\n- The mac & cheese: do yourself a favor and just get it.  Creamy goodness, with a perfect bread crumb topping.\n- Tofu Rice Bowl: a surprising delight.  You MUST order extra kimchee when getting this dish.\n- Fries: crispy and flavorful with feta cheese.\n- Fish Tacos: good, but not their specialty.\n- Pork Belly: I personally don't eat pork belly, but my companion said it was tasty.\n\nDrinks:\n- The Muse is a lovely cocktail (I'm a gin and St. Germain lover).\n- The Spagetti Western was fabulous....and boozy.",

  "text": "I'm a fan of Fare, but my last visit is causing me to reevaluate how much I like Fare. Don't get me wrong, I love the concept of a restaurant that serves organic, local food. The food is fine, the beer list is good and the mimosas were mostly champagne with a splash of orange juice. My last visit was just a little off-putting. \n\nFor one, I just found myself struggling to pick something off the brunch menu on my most recent visit. I was feeling an omelet but neither the meat or veggie special of the day did anything for me. The meat omelet consisted of salmon and lox, and the veggie omelet consisted of mushrooms. I ended up going with the breakfast burrito even though I didn't want that massive of a meal. \n\nThe southwest burrito was stuffed with eggs, pulled pork, black beans, cheddar, pico de gallo and topped with chili. The burrito itself was tasty and very enjoyable. I just remembered it being bigger and coming with a side salad. I know I just said I didn't want a massive meal, but it's never a good thing when portions get smaller and sides are removed. \n\nMy second issue was the service. I was there with a large group after the Hot Chocolate Run. Everyone has certain expectations of large group dining scenarios, and I always enter them with an extra drop of patience. While our food came within 30 minutes of ordering, it was hard to get a server to even stop by our table to take our drink orders. Some beverages were forgotten, some extra beverages were added to the bill and some food items just came out wrong. With the number of races scheduled each year in the Fairmount area, one would think Fare would be prepared and thriving with large group brunches. Although my group dining service expectations are never high, I was fairly disappointed with the service we actually got. \n\nI still like Fare and would absolutely go back, I just need to bump them down on my Fairmount priority list.",

The pizzas are huge and pretty good. The price can be more than a regular pizza place, but the quality is there. After about a 3ish year hiatus, we stopped by there on a Thursday night to meet a friend from out of town.\n\nIt's crazy how much 12 South has grown over the past couple years. I remember when this was about it on the strip. They can still hold their own against the new places. We parked out back and entered through the rear and saw the hostess for a seat on the patio because the summer temperature was tolerable. Our server greeted us and got our drink orders.\n\nWe also decided on ordering some apps to share for dinner, the bruschetta, there homemade seasoned focaccia bread topped with gorgonzola cheese & Italian diced tomato relish ($8.50). We ordered the fried cheese ravioli sticks, seasoned ravioli stuffed with an assortment of cheeses and fried, served with marinara sauce ($9.75). Lastly we got the cheese fries, steak fries with melted provolone, mozzarella, & bacon ($8.50). \n\nMy favorite from this was the loaded fries with ranch. The portions on the appetizers are huge. I liked the bruschetta, but with it being focaccia bread, it can be a lot bread. I like with its more on a toast point. The mushrooms in the toppings had a very hard, almost chewy skin. The fried cheese was yummy. Three came to an order and you could make a meal out of two of them. I've missed this place and will have to keep it in mind the next time we are in the area.",

So when Edmonton's newest French restaurant, The Marc, opened it doors downtown I was one of the first to grace its doors. A spacious, simplistic and clean decor, allows the marvelous food that exits the tiny kitchen to be the real star of this space. The menu is small but each item reads like a work of art. From the scrumptious steak tartar, the awe inspiring duck confit to the perfectly seared skin on the arctic char, this place impresses. The Marc has now been around for over a year and I have been there 5 or 6 times, each time I am truly delighted by my meal. If you ever are in need of some serious cheering up, nothing says comfort food like the foie gras truffle frites with a glass of pinot nior, followed by the to-die-for beignets. Pi de resistance!\nSo with a big Merci to the Marc, I invite all to don its doors. \n\nOh, and seriously. Get the Beignets!",

The tour started as soon as we got picked up from our hotel and hit the highway. Instead of just being our bus driver he actually was pointing out different sites on the way to the swap, showing us some of the devastation from Katrina first hand.\n\nOnce we got on the tour we were given a tour of the swap by would you could say is a \"Swamp Person\" which made it pretty interesting since he lived on the swamp for his whole life.\n\nIf you all you are are looking for alligators I do not recommend this tour but a great chance to check out some NOLA culture.",

  "text": "When you first walk in to the restaurant you're greeted by a grand display of wines in the wine room. The restaurant is well lit and decorated in shades of red, yellow and orange, making it feel warm and inviting. On arrival we were greeted promptly and seated in a location of our choice in the restaurant. Although we were the first patrons to arrive for dinner at 5:30 PM, the dining room quickly filled up within the half hour for a busy dinner service. \n\nAfter some brief explanations from our server we decided to start our meal with the Samaki Harrah ($16): catch of the day in a red pepper coriander sauce. That night the restaurant was featuring cod and it was cooked soft and flaky. The red pepper sauce was flavourful without overpowering the dish and the size was just right to prepare us for our entrees. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Lahem Mishwee Platter ($26), which features two skewers of AAA Alberta Spring Creek Ranch grilled beef tenderloin. All the meat entrees at Parkallen are served with your choice of two sides, and he decided on the Lebanese fattoush salad and sauteed fresh vegetables. The skewers of beef were well seasoned and tender, but the star of the plate happened to be the fattoush salad. The tangy dressing over the salad mixed with the salty, crunchy pita crisps made it both refreshing and full of flavour. To this day my boyfriend always reminds me that the fattoush at Parkallen is the best salad he has ever had. Now if only I could get my hands on the recipe...\n\nFor myself I chose to go with the Spring Rack of Lamb ($45) with tabbouleh salad and Lebanese rice. When I'm out for dinner and lamb is on the menu, I will always order it. Parkallen grilled these ribs beautifully as they came out juicy, tender, and the light seasoning allowed for the flavour of the lamb to come through. Of the two sides I really enjoyed the tabbouleh salad, as it was crunchy, tangy, and full of flavour. The rice wasn't anything to write home about, but it was subtly sweet with thinly sliced almonds and hints of cinnamon. \n\nOur dinner ended with some cheesecake ($10) and caramel pecan flan ($10), both of which were a nice way to end the meal. The desserts at Parkallen are brought in from elsewhere, but I wish they had something available that they make in house. \n\nThroughout the dinner we were very well taken care of by our server, and other staff were equally as attentive. Our glasses of water never reached half empty but the servers weren't overbearing either. As Parkallen describes themselves as a Lebanese and Mediterranean fine dining restaurant, it is definitely reflected in their service and pricing. This is not a restaurant you'll be frequenting often, but I would recommend it for celebrations and special occasions. On the other hand, a portion of the menu is dedicated to pizzas made in house. Perhaps it is time for another visit, as I'm curious to see what they have to offer!",

  "text": "I wanted to love Palace of Asia, but I can only give three stars since I either loved or really didn't care for the dishes that we ate.\n\nWe started with the Mixed Appetizer for Two, which I didn't love at all. Everything on the plate was battered and fried. The only thing I really liked from this appetizer was the Harabhara Kabab (spinach ball). Yes, that was deep fried as well, but it wasn't coated like a McDonald's chicken nugget, like the rest of the things on the plate. I mean, really, you take a potato slice and deep fry it? That's it? No, thanks.\n\nFor our entrees we got the Tandoori Mixed Grill and the Panir Masala (note that I actually ORDERED the Palak Panir, which is a spinach-based dish, but what came out was the Panir Masala, a tomato-based dish). We also got some garlic naan.\n\nI didn't love the Tandoori Mixed Grill as much as my husband did. I really liked the chicken, but I couldn't get on board with the lamb (it was ground lamb, and to me, it looked like sausage). The shrimp was also pretty tough to chew.\n\nI have to say that my favorite part of the entire meal was dipping the garlic naan into the Panir Masala. While I wasn't super fond of the cheese cubes in the sauce (because of the texture), they were OK in moderation. The flavors, though, with the garlic naan and the tomato sauce...mmmm, that was good.\n\nSo, in the end, dinner was OK overall, with three components combining to make two stand-out dishes (the spinach balls and the tomato based cheese cube dish/garlic naan). I don't know if I'll be making any desperate attempts to return, but I don't regret going.\n\nAlso - this place is f'ing GIGANTIC.\n\nThe end!",

It's such a relaxing atmosphere, even though it was quite busy on a Sunday afternoon. Kava, coffee, and tea are all available. I'm looking forward to coming here again one evening for some kava and lounging on one of the couches. \nI ordered a small cold brew coffee ($3) instead of kava since I needed to focus on studying. I was pleased with it, but my boyfriend ordered a large hemp tea lemonade ($5) and felt it was rather bitter. Anyhow, they have some desk areas with charging stations and desk lamps, so if you want to study this is a great place. \nWe'll be back here again soon, I'm sure of it. Great place in Seminole Heights!",

We had the General Lee's Chicken, which was sticky, sweet, and crunchy, Kung Pao Pastrami which was savory and spicy and the Mu Shu Pork which was tender, juicy and perfect rolled up in light, yummy pancakes.  \n\nIt was all absolutely delicious! \n\nThere was an off the menu app - Tuna Poke which was also crazy good.  There were fried lotus flowers in the dish - those things are addictive!\n\nThe portions are large so we had plenty of food to take home.   We definitely over ordered but everything sounded so delicious that we couldn't decide.  Not to worry though, we snacked on leftovers yesterday and I finished off the chicken for lunch today.\n\nI also had some sort of tea daiquiri that was sweet but also refreshing.  I'm not normally much of a daiquiri fan, but this was very different.  \n\nAnd the service was great. Our waiter was super attentive and was able to describe every dish in great detail. \n\nWe'll definitely be going back as I am looking forward to trying the rest of the menu.",

  "text": "The Korean food here is pure awesomeness. \n\nMust order the sundubu jjigae (Korean stew) here! It's a hot and spicy soup made with uncurdled dubu (tofu), vegetables, mushrooms, onion, scallions, various combination of tasty seafood and gochujang (chili powder). The soup is made and eaten right in the serving bowl, which is typically made of solid stone. Served with a raw egg to be cracked into the soup. It comes out still bubbling vigorously. You are also given a bowl of cooked white rice and several banchan (side dishes). The banchan are so addicting that you'll ask for seconds! A true Korean meal is never complete without banchan. And the ones here are crazy delicious. Also highly recommend their bbq meats. \n\nI worship this eatery greatly. You might as well stop reading this review and ask me about it in person. Because chances are that if you go here now, I will be there eating my sundubu and banchan!",

  "text": "Oh yelp, you've steered me awry this time. When I went to El Rey, yelp had given this place 4.5 stars.  I was blown away by the stars, but not by the food.\n\nThe food isn't bad. The chips as a starter was actually really good. Tastes fresh, yet not oily at all. And when dipped into the green sauce on the table, it had the perfect amount of crunch and spice.\n\nThe rest of the food was just average. The menu was all over the place - I was looking for a Tinga burrito - not offered. However, there's Tinga fries! Wifey wanted a shrimp taco - not on the menu. But they did have shrimp fajitas! The waiter said the chef would be able to make it, but it's weird that it's not on the menu. So wife did the shrimp fajitas.\n\nThe fajitas came out quick, but came out incorrect. Wife requested her entree have the salad's sour cream on the side. They brought it out with sour cream on top, and an additional side of sour cream. No big deal, but later I was charged for the additional side. And they took her plate back to just take off the pieces of lettuce with sour cream. And yes, I said plate. Aren't fajitas usually served on skillets? Not here. Came out on a plate, already cooked. She noted her shrimp was grilled very well, but there wasn't too many pieces of shrimp. Lots of onions though.\n\nMy carnitas burrito came out ginormous, but it seemed short on carnitas too. And there's no sour cream on the burrito - I used my paid-for sour cream for that.  I only ate half as I was full from the chips. No sauce on top of your burrito either as some other places do with mole, tomatillo, or verde.  Not offered here.\n\nService was really friendly, and the place isn't too big (in a somewhat busy plaza), but I think the food leaves a lil more to be desired than I'd like.  And the prices aren't THAT great. Because of that, I probably wouldn't try this place again. Too many places in the area that offer Mexican, so onto the next one!!",

My gym membership is going to have to start pulling double-duty.\n\nE and I drove over on their opening night and had no trouble finding parking on this deserted stretch of Washington Ave. The wait was considerable, but you could see everyone hustlin their hearts out back in the open kitchen, and everyone had a smile on their face. The longer you wait, the more time you get to deliberate over the pastry cases. If you don't get a butterscotch blondie, though, just slap yourself in the face right now. It is possibly the most delicious blondie I've ever had, and I would even rate it higher than a fudgey chocolatey brownie. So rich, moist and sweet. I'm ashamed to say I ate almost all of it even after binge-ing on pizza. E only got a few bites. We also got an oreo marshmallow (just what it sounds like, and it was great!), and a maple vanilla pecan fudge. That thing was ridiculously good, too.\n\nAs for the pizza, I can say they've got our  business on lock for quite some time. The gluten-free crust is house made, not a frozen pre-formed tragedy, and I really enjoyed its texture. Slightly fluffy in the middle with a great cornmeal crunch on the bottom. The pizza sauce is perfection and they use good pepperoni. We also got a regular large white mushroom pizza. I had 2 slices of that... Good God it was so good. Super garlicky, tons of exotic mushrooms, and an excellent crust. This place rules. Long live Kermit's!",

It's got coupons you might need.  If not? put it back.\n\nTop buys for me?  Almond milk (they have the bigger refrigerated container and the chocolate one is good), coconut water (hard to find in large sizes), peanut butter (i forget the brand but it's soo good), olive bar (so many choices, pricey but YUM)\n\ntip: bring your own bag, you'll either get a 5 cent discount off your purchase or you can get a wood token instead to donate to a charity on display (last visit it was american red cross for haiti)",

Very classy look on the inside with some interesting wall decor. While this plaza always has too many great places and not enough parking spots, tonight we were able to get a spot right up front and was seated within 5 minutes. \n\nSo two things I really liked. The separate pickup window is actually really nice and right thre when you first go in. Also, they have a really cool coloring sheet for kids that is more challenging than most other places. It kept my son occupied the whole evening. \n\nWe order the stuffed breadsticks and the thin style meat-lovers. Both were great. The pizza was good cold and was exceptional when I warmed it up the next day in a cast-iron skillet. Perfectly crispy crust.\n\nSince we were looking for a new \"pizza home,\" it seems we have found it.",

Have you heard the term Nashvegas?  You will see why if you come to the 34th floor and eat here.  The nightlife you can view from the top is stunning.  I came here for a medical conference, conveniently at this hotel, so I didn't have to go anywhere.  My colleague and I enjoyed dinner here twice in a row, because it was too good to pass up.  We had to scour the area for seating, and were lucky enough to get seats both nights at the bar and lounge area. \n\nThey actually have two bars here, one inside and one on the outskirts.   The outer tables are most desirable, because you have amazing views from the restaurant out onto the city lights.  The last night, we sat at the outer bar, and my only gripe is the TV sets.  They are so high up your neck starts to hurt.  It was like sitting in the front row at the movie theater.  No one wants that!  I don't know why they didn't engineer those better.\n\nNow the drinks....delicious!  I had the French martini, and it was sooo good!  They served it with those super fancy cherries, too. They aren't big, and they are not cheap.  So for one Old fashioned and a martini, it was $39 and change.  The drinks were on point, though.\n\nThe food was hit or miss.  Some things were really good.  The fries were amazing!  Seriously the best fries I think I've ever had in my life.  They come out steaming hot, and they are served with three different condiments, a barbeque sauce, a fancy ketcup, and truffle sauce.  The truffle fries were definitely my fav.  The rest were really good, too.  No soggy fries either.  They were rich and satisfying.  So good I got them both nights.\n\nThey had a shellfish platter, which was really good. It came with the option of hot or cold.  We got the hot served with a miso butter.  Everything was really tasty. $85 though for not a ton of food.\n\nThe lobster tacos were a disappointment, just not enough flavor but I did like that the shell stayed crispy,  not soggy. \n\nThe tuna roll was killer. Super fresh! Very good taste and the chef was so kind to make me a spicy mayo with sriracha. AMAZING! \n\nI'm actually glad I don't live here because I'm pretty sure that I would have clogged arteries because I cannot stay away from those fries. I'd also be broke. I feel kinda badly I didn't eat anywhere else on this trip, but man...the view, the food, the martinis...and right at my hotel was a win, win, win.  See you next year!",

  "text": "One of my sons loves this place, so I get to sample the wares.\n\nOverall, I would say the quesadillas are much more quesadilla and much less filling. I prefer more filling, yet it's all still tasty.\n\nThe size of these quesadillas is monumental! I'd say one could serve at least two people!\n\nI've sampled:\n\nThe St. Louis ($7.49) -- Parmesan tomato sauce, pepperoni, Italian sausage, provel and Mozzarella cheeses on a tomato-basil tortilla.\n\nThe Texas ($7.49) -- Home-made smoky sweet barbeque sauce, red onions, grilled chicken, thick-cut bacon, cheddar and monterey jack cheeses on a flour tortilla.\n\nThe Italian ($7.49) --  Parmesan tomato sauce, red onions, red and green peppers, provel and Mozzarella cheeses on a tomato-basil tortilla.\n\nThe Parma ($7.49) -- Parmesan tomato sauce, grilled chicken, provel and Mozzarella cheeses on a flour tortilla.\n\nThe Bleachers 'Chos ($6.99) are really the king! Yea, I know, it's just nachos. But the four-cheese queso is stupendously fabulous, and I could drink it by the gallon!\n\nAlso, as others have said: after 8 p.m., everything's $5.",

  "text": "Nick's Roast Beef was recently remodeled and it looks really great inside. There are a ton of TVs around the bar, making this a great spot to catch a game. On the other side of the restaurant, there are tables and booths for a more quiet, family oriented experience. There are always great specials and the food is reasonable.\n\nI always opt for the roast beef sandwiches. They have a variety of tasty toppings. Fries don't come with the sandwich, but a side order will take care of 2-3 people with no problem. I recently tried the sweet potato fries and they were really tasty.\n\nIf you sit at the bar , as I always do, be wary the the crowd can get a little dicey sometimes. They are mostly harmless, but can be annoying. Some examples are a group of drunks screaming at the TV during a Phillies game, and a weird pill head who tried hitting on my sister in law but couldn't get the words out because he was slurring- we ignored him and he stumbled away. I think the staff of this establishment could do a better job of controlling the crowds for the benefit of their other patrons. I've seen people get tossed out of other establishments for less.\n\nI will still continue to go to Nick's to watch games and eat their delicious roast beef sandwiches, but I will definitely never go alone.",

Although the barista forgot my sugar free vanilla, after adding it, it was one of the best made iced coffees I've had in awhile from Starbucks.

  "text": "Spent a long time walking around French  Quarter to find somewhere to eat. After over an hour I settled for Gumbo Shop and I'm very glad I did! The entrance is down a little alley and goes into the restaurant and a courtyard. We ate in the restaurant which was packed with lots of people. We were first given a simple loaf of bread, nothing special. Then I ordered the Creole Combination Platter. It came with shrimp creole, jambalaya and red beans and rice. My most favorite was the shrimp creole and I would order the larger size of just that if I ever came again. Very tasty and your basic flavorful food. For dessert we then got the bread pudding. Yum Yum but I was so full that i couldn't eat it all. I felt that the hostess was a bit rude the way she talked, but our waitress was super nice and friendly. The atmosphere is also very nice and cozy for a lunch or dinner.",

Hubs was on an epic gumbo quest so we thought, \"Why the hell not?\" We were the first customers when they opened for the day and all the servers looked ready begin their shifts.  Our server was excellent and really nice. I loved hearing him pitch the daily special and make recommendations. \nI wasn't extremely hungry and wanted something small.  Hubs got the chicken and okra gumbo.  He did not like it at all.  He felt like it was more of a Creole style gumbo than a Cajun style like where he's from.  I thought it was fine, but I'm no expert on gumbo.\nI got a side of chicken, sausage, and shrimp jambalaya. Holyyyyy shit. That little side was so filling and rich with flavor.  Not too salty and not too spicy.  \nAfter checking out, we went across the street to a local coffee shop and soon after, one of the servers from Gumbo Shop came in and brought us a shopping bag that I had forgotten in the restaurant. \nI was going to give them a 3 star but I was so happy with my little meal and the service that I have to bump them up a star.",

  "text": "Cajun Encounters has all the signs of a tourist trap, because it is one, a really good one. There is no easier way to jump on a boat and explore the swamps of Georgia. Here are the main reasons why I'm grading this so highly:\n\n-=-Easy-=- There's a shuttle to get here for a fee. I was feeling a bit more adventurous so, I rented a car to make the 40 mile drive out of New Orleans proper and into the marshlands. Shuttle for two was around 50 bucks, so my car rental was well worth the little extra.\n\n-=-Fun-=- Boat rides are fun rides, but for this one hold on to your hats. You will go fast, you will go slow, you will go to a crawl with less than 1 foot clearance between trees. Animals are mostly unpredictable, but typically you'll see at least a couple alligators. There is potential to see wild boars, snakes, and turtles as well. \n\n-=-Captain Mike-=- \"Where y'at where y'at!\" \"Livin da life!\" \"Awite!\"...and more! Super laid back, highly informative, and those alligator calls were pretty cool. \"Chikee chikee chikee!\" I cannot recommend Captain Mike enough. Toss him a good tip afterwards too.

  "text": "I guess this must be what it's like to be treated like a celebrity! From the moment my friend and I walked in, we received friendly, individualized attention, despite the fact that we were sweaty and dressed somewhat sloppily from our day outdoors.  We were treated like VIPs as the red carpet was rolled out (figuratively!) and sat down at a beautiful, white table.  The place was sparkling clean, elegant, yet not stuffy.  This would be a great place for a romantic date! Don't let the unassuming exterior fool you, because it's actually quite elegant inside! Andre, the sharply dressed man that greeted us, is actually the owner, and he does a great job as a host, making each person that walks in feel special.  His entire demeanor is very calm and pleasant, and I was caught off-guard, because I have become a hardened Miamian that does not experience this often, unless there is an ulterior motive.\n\nThe music was fun, and energetic, and Andre had such a peaceful, happy energy about him that it permeated throughout his restaurant.  You couldn't help but feel happy while you were in the establishment.  The food options were plentiful and all sounded delicious, but my friend and I stuck with the safe choice of jerk chicken, which came with a salad and rice and peas.  We each decided to get a large, dinner portion, but had no idea it would be so much food! It was certainly enough to share, though to be fair, we had also had some delicious jerk chicken wings to start.  I had a watermelon soda, which satisfied my sweet tooth, and was very refreshing.  The chicken was very tender and tasty, and the wings especially were hot and spicy, just as we had asked.  It's great to find food that is well-seasoned, and that does not mean that it is dripping in salt.  On the contrary -- it means other flavors and spices dominate, with salt taking a backseat.  We were also told the ingredients were all locally sourced, and organic. \n\nWe were checked on constantly, to make sure we were happy.  Not too long after, Janise, the owner's wife, came over to personally ask if everything was satisfactory.  She also happens to be the chef, we found out, and is from St. Thomas, which means you're getting the real deal here -- authentic Caribbean cooking! Janise was as lovely and friendly as her husband.  I guess that is probably why the food was so full of flavor and love, because they genuinely enjoy making people happy and have pride in their business.  We were too full to get dessert, and I am sure we missed out on something great, judging by the Yelp pictures.  I am glad my friend and I did not go to the place that the staff from the Henry B. Plant Museum had recommended and that we came here, instead, because that place was not very well-received.  Thanks to my Yelp app, I found Yah Mon, read some of the reviews, and we were sold.  The food, and the reviews, did not disappoint. If you're anywhere near this restaurant, you must make it a point to dine here.  Great food, catchy name, clean space, and great service.  This is the standard by which all restaurants should be judged!",

They were completely booked for Fri and sat evening. If you're a walk in, expect to wait at least 1-2 hrs.

Singer layers his music too which is exciting to hear him create it live.\n\n\n\n\nI N T E R I O R / E X T E R I O R \nWell designed decor. Clean. Well kept. Open concept. Casual but you can def wear dressy casual. \n\nThere's a lot of seating. Well placed. Seating ranges from 2-10+ people. Tables are generally social distanced. A few customers complained that it's a bit chilly outside so the employees turned on the patio heated lamps.\n\n\n\n\nI N F E C T I O N    P R E V E N T I O N\nNo hand sanitizer stand available to customers. Employees were wearing masks. Most customers inside were wearing masks unless eating. Masks seem to be enforced. \n\n\n\n\nF O O D \nOld havana punch 9: soo strong. I'm def a lightweight but I drank 1/6 and it had me feeling a little woozy. V fruity. Basically a rum punch. Yum. \n\nPanko crusted grouper 22: pretty good. Fresh. Almost gave me a thai style feel. \n\nCrab cakes 14: omg unreal. So good. One of the best crab cakes I've ever had. Textured, fried well. Not mushy. Flavorful. Large. The salad thing that came w it, was soo good. Sweet. Not overly mayo-y. \n\nOysters, fresh, dozen 19: shucked well. So fresh. Meaty. Uggh. Yesssss. Must get. \n \nDeep water mahi mahi 25: mahi mahi was so fresh. Grilled. Sooo tasty. Has some sweet tangy sauce. Rice gave me the 油飯 feel. V flavorful. I don't usually eat more than a bite of the rice that comes w the meal but I almost finished all of it. \n\nHonestly, when I come back, bc I will, will def get mahi mahi, oysters and the crab cakes. They were a hit x1000. I'm already missing it and I haven't even left the restaurant yet. \n\n\n**This food had me and my friend filling 60% full. Not  large portions. Probably should get 1-2 appetizers + an entree per person. Or get 1 app, 1 entree and 1 dessert per person. \n\n\n\n\nS E R V I C E\nDustyy was a great waiter. He was friendly and open to give suggestions. He checked on us just enough. Available. Fantastic. \n\n\n\n\nB A T H R O O M S \nRelatively clean. out of paper towels tho. 4 stalls in the women's. 2 sinks. Space is small. Hard to social distance. \n\n\n\nP R I C E \n+ tax/tip = 120",

I used to order the orange chicken that came fresh with a crunch with a spicy orange sauce that came on top with a orange slice to top it all off.

THANK YOU! Our bellies and hangry side love you. I ordered the Generals Tso chicken lunch that comes with chicken rice but I substituted mine for veggie rice which was perfect. And years later the food was still on point with it being fresh with a crunch and flavor on point. \n\nI ordered a side of the spring rolls and a crab ragoons and they were both delish coming with sweet and sour sauce for both which i never use but thank you for thinking of my taste buds.\n\nThere was enough food for 2 days if you have a small belly like mine (not meaning small on the outside ;) ) Which is always a plus.\n\nI will be back in a few years when I have a craving.

I don't know what was better, the live awesome 1920's jazz music or the fabulous food. This place is a winner in my book. \n\nThey have delicious old fashioned and freshly made cocktails here unbelievably in the $7/ $8 range. I tried the lavender lace and the fiance got the Pim's cup. Tell me where have you ever seen a Pim's cup on a menu? The only other place we had heard of it was on the show Boardwalk Empire. I swear I thought  I had fallen back into the 1920's here. I really couldn't stop saying how much fun I was having.\n\nAs for food, I highly recommended the scallops. They were the highlight of the evening. Super creamy and and the felafel crust on them worked so well. Who knew. I really don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu we had a few other small plates and they were all good. \n\nNow to add this review to my Best of the Best list.",

  "text": "While walking around Bourbon Street, it's a little frightening to see white powder riddled on the streets and plastered on peoples' noses.  Because of that, you might suspect people are sniffing cocaine due to their boisterous attitudes, but after eating beignet's at Cafe Beignet on Bourbon Street, I'm convinced that they are the reason for such things. Lol\n\nCafe Beignet offers better beignets than Cafe Du Monde and it's not even close.  They're far more fluffy, soft, well-sized, and deliciously powdered than any beignet I've had and it's only $3.99 for three!\n\nCafe Beignet has two locations--one being this one inside Musical Legends Park on Bourbon Street and the other on Royal.  I much rather prefer the one on Royal as it has a more clean and endearing environment.  This specific location on Bourbon is more fun and lively, but the distasteful smells of Bourbon Street creeps in from time to time.  I do love the live jazz music that is played though.  \n----\nConclusion: Those who are looking for 5 star beignets and a lively, musical atmosphere, come to this outdoor location.  I, along with Mr. Alton Brown (famous food critic on the food channel) agree Cafe Beignet is much better than Cafe Du Monde.  Come here for food, alcohol, music, and the best beignets! can be found here too!  \n\nExtra Notes:\n-Accepts credit card\n-Tables are available but be aggressive when trying to obtain one.  There are three tables upstairs near the restroom too\n-Service can be better as they're not very friendly or helpful\n-Restrooms are filthy",

There's plenty to entertain you in the area while you wait. \n\nA late dinner at Three Muses was the perfect way to start our weekend in New Orleans: great food, local beers, wonderful live music, and friendly service. My group of four shared a bunch of tapas including: seared scallops, bacon wrapped dates, lamb sliders, swiss chard fritters (AMAZING), mac n' cheese, and feta fries. Almost everything we tried was great and we stayed for hours, listening to the music and ordering more tapas as the night went on. Definitely a gem on Frenchmen!",

Their jambalaya has the perfect amount of heat and southern spice, and I arrived in NOLA looking for jambalaya that would meet my criteria. \n\nAfter being disappointed by a few other restaurants, I decided to stop by Gumbo Shop on a whim after reading the Yelp reviews. I'm so glad I did!! I got my jambalaya to go because it was nearing closing time for the restaurant. Although the presentation in my to-go box was not super impressive, upon first taste, the age-old adage \"do not judge a book by it's cover\" rang true.\n\nThe jambalaya was exactly what I was craving - it was hearty and had all of the flavors that I was looking for. The portions were generous and they definitely did not skimp on any of the ingredients!\n\nIf you are in the area and looking for some great jambalaya to round out your NOLA trip, put Gumbo Shop on your list!",

Among standard burgers and fries, they have cheese curds, and custard.\nThey have indoor dining as well as a drive thru.\n\nButter Burger - Tastes like a more \"Home cooked\" version of a MCDonalds burger. Less heavy. It's not spectacular .  3/5\n\nCheese Curds- These are small spheres of cheese covered with batter and fried. The cheese is melty and the breading complements it well.  3.5/5\n\nCustard - I got the flavor of the day (Chocolate caramel) I would say the consistency is between traditional ice cream and frozen yogurt. The only custard I've eaten is flan once or twice. This is different from that. This was really good and worth going back for. 4/5\n\nThe place is clean and the employees are friendly. The food took about 8 minutes to come out.\n\nThere are covered seats outside to eat under.\n\nOverall: This is a solid but unremarkable place. The custard is worth getting repeatedly though.",

  "text": "It is always a shame when the service mars the efforts of the kitchen.\n\nI visited Grille 39 for a business dinner on a corporate trip to Indy recently since the restaurant was located at The Renaissance in Carmel and - if nothing else - it is remarkably convenient location if you are staying at this or a neighboring hotel. The amenities are opulent, most notably the Bar area which boasts some fantastic bartenders. \n\nSadly, the service the Bar offers is in deep contrast to the dining area and it is largely due to the leadership/management of Grille 39. Our group of 40 was served by a single server named Joel that deserved better. Drinks took ages to arrive. Plates arrived in haphazard fashion. There was zero balance to the timing because Joel was running for his life for two hours. This is inexplicable for a hotel of this size - get it together Renaissance.\n\nIt is a real shame too. The kitchen is among the best in the hotel industry. \n\nAs a starter Salad, I when with the Classic Cesar which is a run of the mill rendition featuring chopped Romaine, shaved Parmesan flakes, Croutons, tossed in a classic Caesar Dressing. There was nothing to complain about as the ingredients were plenty fresh but there was no real pop to the combination.\n\nThe Filet Mignon, however, was splendid. Cooked to a precise medium-rare with the perfect amount of char on the outside and a juicy/succulent interior. Even the seasoning was applied expertly and I must admit that this may be the best Steak I have ever had at a mid-level hotel. Chef Erik Kemeny can take pride in his team's ability to put together one hell of a beefsteak. I was very impressed. \n\nTruth be told, both Joel and Erik deserve more than the 3 stars I can award considering the experience. Hopefully, adjustments will be made in the future in order for their considerable efforts to be fully realized.",

  "text": "I really wanted to like this Midwestern burger restaurant based upon all of their hype when they started opening locations in the Tampa Bay area, but after my visit I drove away thinking \"mehhh\".\n\nCulver's started as a fast-casual food chain in Wisconsin in the mid-80's, and has quickly spread to over 500 franchised restaurants nationwide. They advertise \"Welcome to Delicious\", and promote their Butterburgers and frozen custard, among other menu items.\n\nThis particular location of Culver's can be found on Nebraska Avenue, just north of Bearss. I visited there on a weeknight, and stood in line with lots of families. The menu is quite large, and it takes a while to read through everything before finally making your selection.\n\nI ordered a Mushroom Swiss Butterburger with a side of onion rings, and took my numbered placard over to a vacant table while they prepared my meal. According to the information I read, Culver's uses a freshly-ground mix of three cuts of beef: sirloin, chuck and plate. The patties are mashed down on the flat-top in order to cook more quickly, but that also means there is a loss of some of the juices. The buns are lightly-buttered on the crowns, and toasted, and then the whole thing is assembled and placed into your basket along with your sides. (I don't get the concept of buttering the top of the bun, but I wasn't a fan.)\n\nWhat I ended up with was a bun that was greasy to the touch, and meat that was dry and lacking in flavor. Thankfully they had added the Swiss cheese and grilled mushrooms, but I had to get up and get some mustard and black pepper to put on the burger. Maybe I was supposed to ask them to add condiments and seasonings, but that certainly was not made clear during the ordering process.\n\nThe onion rings were OK, but they'd sat in the fry oil a bit too long and were bordering on being burned. Again, back to the condiments bar for more ketchup and mustard as a dipping sauce.\n\nIn the end I paid $10 for a meal which left me disappointed. I've certainly had much better burgers at other places, and so I'll have to plan a return trip to see if I just happened to catch them on a bad day.",

He was diligent in texting me when he was coming to pick up my family and was on time! Madison also had extensive knowledge of the New Orleans area and was very funny and witty telling jokes and relating with the guests on our tour. Through our conversations, we found out that Madison is a very educated man holding a degree in Physics from Tulane! How about that!!! He was able to explain some physics to my children as well as tell us about the realities of the people we were seeing as we were driving towards the Plantation. He explained to us about the history of the people around the area and that many were actually descendants of the slaves that were working on the fields. He also explained the history of the Creole movement which I found truly fascinating! When we reached the plantations, Madison was quick to grab our tickets and we were swiftly off learning all the rich historical history of the Laura plantation and Oak Alley Plantation! Simply marvelous!!! At the end of both tours, he simply just let us soak it all by playing some of his favorite blues music that really made the whole experience enjoyable and memorable! Some Chucky Berry, Elvis, Dixie Cups, and some local blues! Thank you Madison! I'll be back and I'll specifically ask for you!",

But what I can have is a Five Guys burger patties with some toppings and make myself a little burger salad. \n\nWell Syvia K. made that ask not seem annoying (although I know it is). She even then went around the whole floor to ask people how their meals were.

It wan't even that long of a delay but the effort and true kindness was unmatched to an experienced i've had any time recently at a restaurant of any level. I will be back for sure and I hope Syvia is working. \n\nAs for the Burger \"Bowl\" As I am calling it - I asked for the hamburger without the bun and no lettuce wrap. It came in a nice little aluminum container with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles on one side, grilled onions & the burger patty on the other and mustard on the side. It was exactly what I wanted.

Good Sichuan cuisine can be so addictive with ample amount of numbing citrusy peppercorn and fragrant chili oil.  I admit the noodles were spicy and numbing.  There was also plenty of sodium, so it wasn't bland either.  What it greatly lacked was a good base made from simmering pork bones or chicken bones.  Imagine this without the spicy components, the broth is actually very watery.  I have nothing against MSG, I use it in my own cooking, but you can't rely only on MSG for umami.  The richness and savoriness of a well made stock can't be duplicated with a few sprinkles of MSG.  I also didn't like the beef being cut into perfectly square meat cubes.  The texture would be much better as thin slices.  If they can just make the stock better and tone down the MSG a little, the noodles here would be addictive.",

Sonny's.\n\nContrary to popular (tourist) belief, a typical Philadelphian's breakfast, lunch, and dinner is -not- comprised of a cheesesteak. If it were, however, I suppose Sonny's is where I'd go. Not Pat's, not Geno's, not Jim's, but Sonny's. \n\nWhile the aformentioned hot spots cater to visitors, Sonny's feels a bit more local and genuine. There's no colloquially forced ordering procedure (\"wit,\" \"witout,\" \"whiz\" - I'm pretty sure Pat's/Geno's/Jim's does that to suggest local flavor) and they offer more sophisticated toppings. After all, a cheesesteak is just like any other sandwich, one that's not limited to just onions and cheese. \n\nSo if you're in the neighborhood, hopping off your Olde City carriage ride or walking out of the Constitution Center, Sonny's is a sure bet. You won't find a line trailing around the corner and you won't find a bunch of tourists reciting the proper way to order their cheesesteak in line. No pretension, no bull, just good meat and cheese sandwiches. \n\nHolla.",

The pricing in reasonable and the service is good.  I've also eaten here on a weeknight, when its quieter and a litle more personable.  I had entrees on this occasion and really enjoyed their salmon special.",

  "text": "In planning our trip to New Orleans, my friend suggested we do a haunted voodoo tour. Misreading the email, and thinking I was signing up for a Vodka Tour, you can imagine my surprise when we got to Madame Laveau's and there was no distilling equipment in sight. Compounding this, when our tour guide started to describe the haunted background of New Orleans, I couldn't help but roll my eyes a bit (correction: a whole lot actually). \n\nHowever, once he started leading us through the French Quarter, my skepticism quickly faded away. Our tour guide Randy managed to give the backstory of New Orleans and its history as a colony, first of the Spanish, then the French, and finally the Americans. Throughout it all, the only constant was something unnatural and dare I say paranormal. Randy managed to keep our group of about 20 entertained, educated and slightly scared. Though perhaps I was the most scared, when I spontaneously started bleeding right as he began talking about vampires!! (Thankfully it was only a nosebleed brought by dry air and dehydration)\n\nThroughout our vacation in NOLA, we kept running into other tour guides, yet Voodoo Bone Lady was the absolute best, hands down, namely due to Randy and the incredible tour he gave.",

The part I didn't like is the part where we waited for about an hour at the Swamp Tour's gift shop  for another bus tour to arrive. Once I suppose everyone arrived they separated us according to the group package we selected and then we were led to a boat and led slowly through a swamp trying to beg baby alligators to give us attention by throwing marshmallows at them. Only we never saw any in that section of our extended tour package. From there we went in reverse and it was a nice ride when our tour guide was speeding through the open swamp because I got a breeze and felt like I was in a slightly exciting adventure but then it was back to lets throw something at that alligator and see if they want to play. \n\nThey didnt.  \n\nBring Sunblock and a Hat.",

This also comes with the Greek lemon soup and a simple apple honey dessert that is so good. Everything was cooked to perfection.\n\nOur meal was extraordinary and this is my most favorite restaurant at the Sponge Docks. You gotta try it and be Patient if you wait a while.

  "text": "This is one of the best Italian restaurants I've been to in South Jersey in recent memory. It's a bit off the beaten path, you need to make a reservation and you shouldn't come expecting the likes of spaghetti and meatballs and chicken Parmesean to be gracing the menu; but that doesn't mean it's not worth a visit. \n\nThe first thing I was taken aback by was the noise in the restaurant. I was hoping for a more intimate, quiet setting; however, it felt like you had to talk loudly even to the person right next to you. Not the worst thing, just not as quiet as I had hoped. \n\nAfter placing our order, we were served a variety of freshly baked bread. We started off with the grilled octopus which was a special of the day. We both agreed that the flavor of the octopus was delicious but felt that it could have been a tad bit crispier. \n\nNext we shared the pesto Trapanese - fusilli pasta with almond-pistachio pesto which is one of the best pasta dishes I've had in a long time. We were also served complimentary gnocchi alla' Argentiera - spinach and ricotta topped with Sicilian caciocavallo which was very good. \n\nAs for the entrees, I ordered the Coniglio Pizzaiola - stewed rabbit with tomato and fresh oregano with rosemary oven roasted potatoes. I really enjoyed the sauce which was full of flavor as well as the crispy potatoes. The rabbit was super tender but also a bit under-seasoned. My dining partner ordered the lamb and we both agreed that although it was cooked perfectly, it too was lacking in seasoning. \n\nWe rounded out our experience with Zeppoli Siciliano which even came with a lit candle for my birthday thanks to my companion. We both agreed that the zeppolis were by far the best thing we had eaten off the menu - not dense at all, so light, airy and sweet. I still think about them sometimes....\n\nI really enjoyed my experience here and love that Zeppoli is not just any other NJ Italian restaurant. Four stars which can easily be five stars. Perhaps invest in some nice napkins (the dish towel on my lap is better suited for the kitchen), work on the noise, and add just a tad more seasoning. I look forward to returning.",

We all also ordered entrees which did not really receive any negative remarks aside from the collard greens. Drago's ya'll are in the deep south honey, PLEASE upgrade the collards so we can enjoy those too! They just severely missed the mark. \n\nOur server Jamie was ready to go home and basically rushed us and appeared to get a little frustrated by us ordering more food.

Sadly, my $14 sandwich (which was really more of a banh mi than anything - I admit, it was a nice twist) was soggy after just a few minutes. Decent flavors, good bread, but overall way way way overpriced. I get it, we're in the FQ where you can get away with hiked up prices, but I rarely pay more than $4 for a banh mi. Actually, I think the whole wondrous magical spirit behind a banh mi is that you're getting this fat, amazing sandwich with pickled veggies and cilantro for a piggy-bank loving price.

They do great for a solo trip, a couple, small group of friends or a hoard of hungry lacrosse players (my team's favorite team dinner spot)\n\nDinner is about 15 bucks but it's cheaper at lunch.  The Habachi is by far one of the best around.  The only place that comes to mind that may rival it is in Delaware.  They do a nice job of keeping your table cleaned off (be mindful to set your fork aside so they don't take it), and refilling your drink.  They have a couple of TV's playing (usually without sound) which can be cool to check out if you're afraid you'll miss out on some news or sports action.  \n\nThey have crawfish that were surprisingly tasty, the skewed chicken is great, beef with broccoli, and sweet and sour chicken is also solid choices.  I was pleased with the temperature of all the food but if you truly want to master the Ichiban experience... this is what you do.  \n        Go to the hibachi part of the joint, load up your plate and have him cook it up they way you like, now walk away... trust me, walk away.  Grab a second plate and start filling it with already prepared food out on the buffet.  By they time you are done walk back over to the hibachi dude and wait a few more minutes. When he is done he will hand you a plate with your piping hot (about 600 degrees) food on it.  Walk over to your table and dig into your plate of buffet food while your hibachi cools to a reasonable temperature.  Repeat as necessary.  You are welcome.\n\nAlso available is some random American food, sushi, soups, desserts, and a salad bar.  If you leave here hungry its your own fault.",

Custard is richer and softer with eggs and higher fat content than normal ice cream.  (Since I was raised on it I can taste the difference)  Then I order raspberries, nuts and chocolate \"fox treat\"  sundae or blend with whatever sounds good.  (I like deciding, with the concrete, what exactly I want in my own personal dessert- fruit, candy bar, nuts, pies, and/or chocolate fudge (I like the fudge to be added on top of the mix).  The list of stuff I can add is insane in length and variety, plus the ability to combine...)  I only live once so I will treat myself to my own personally created indulgence, even in the winter.\n\nIn the summer this place looks insane.  The lines does move FAST so just get ready to order (do not procrastinate on making a decision on what anyone in your group wants- I get everyones order and tell them to wait at the car).  This place is a hangout during summer nights for kids of all ages.\n\nI worked across the street for 4 years and they always have a line.  In the middle of winter with snow on the ground, THERE IS A LINE.  The frozen custard is that good (something richer than standard ice cream).\n\nIf you want standard hard scoop ice cream that you can pick the extras like a concrete- GO to Cold Stone so we have less of a line.\n\n=)",

After a week of eating fried chicken and Creole fare, my boyfriend and I were looking for something different on our last night in NOLA and chose this place. We're definitely glad we did. \n\nWe ordered two appetizers and split them - the Fried Goat Cheese Salad and Baked Brie in a garlic cream sauce. I'm a huge fan of Brie, and this one was absolutely phenomenal, although I wish it had been served with crackers. The salad was tasty as well, and the dressing almost tasted like a honey mustard vinaigrette. \n\nI ordered the Shrimp and Grits as an entree and enjoyed that very much as well. The portion size was very generous, but unfortunately after filling up on Brie, I couldn't finish my food and the grits hardened to the plate. \n\nOverall, this is a great spot for a date night or wine Wednesday with the girls.

I had read reviews and most of them were positive, however, I read a review from an Indian Restaurant Review web site that TOTALLY trashed this place. After going there, I'm convinced that the review I had read was either a competitor or a disgruntled employee. The place is classy with Excellent service. It's a BYOB. The staff is friendly and overly accommodating. The prices were competitive and the food was promptly served and fresh. This is an excellent place to take someone on a nice date or a business guest. The atmosphere was relaxing and the restrooms clean. For the price and ambiance, this place is a winner. The food was good. They boast about their daily luncheon buffet that I've yet to try but will be doing so soon. I've read raves on it and the price $ 10.95 seems to be a bargain. Will be back again soon. Enjoyed it.",

I guess basically what I am saying is this place majorly lacks in atmosphere, but I guess you're not really there for that.\n \nWe decided on the wet burrito to share. There are a couple of options for the type of meat; we chose carne asada. Along with the burrito, we got an order of chips and salsa.\n \nOur food was ready to pick up pretty quickly. The serving of chips was huge. I wasn't a fan of the salsa, which is completely smooth, but this might just be a personal preference. Sharing the burrito was a good choice; it really is big enough to serve two people, especially with the side of chips. The red sauce that the burrito is topped with has a really tin-like flavor which was really off putting, but the fillings inside were much better.\n \nOverall, a passable late night meal. I had no idea this place existed until recently, so I foresee some more trips here in the future, I just might stay away from the wet burritos and salsa...",

The food however is pretty awesome. Also if you're just looking for a big clean convenient business place to have seafood this is a good spot.\n\nFried oysters were as fresh as possible.\n\nSeafood Gumbo was the best gumbo I've had in years. A mix of oysters, shrimp, and crab.\n\nFried shrimp was well fried shrimp.",

There is some counter seating too. Service was good and efficient.  We ordered a bottle of red wine for three diners.  Most of the wine options are Italian and we got a Sangiovese.\n\nI ordered some garlic bread that was simply delicious and full or garlicky taste, plus a grilled garlic on the side to fetch out pieces to add and smear if you like.\n\nMy entree was the linguine and clams.  The pasta was perfect, al dente, with slices of sausage and small whole tomatoes.  There was plenty infusion of garlic, but unfortunately I have to say I didn't detect any clams! One of dining companions had the same dish and remarked the same.\n\nIt was all in all a charming place for a cozy Italian meal in a relaxed atmosphere.",

But we were going to be in the backyard at 1 pm for a food event. \nChris set up an art tour of the hotel prior  to our food event. \n\nThe Morrison Burner Hotel was started in 2013. It was remodeled by volunteers using as much original material and recycled furnishings. The hotel is also ran by volunteers. Their philosophy is based in the ten principles of burning man. Gemini escorted us thru the first and second floors, the saloon and backyard of the 1928 building.  \n\nSteam Punk Saloon is a great space. And you can't knock the prices. \n\nThe hotel hosts various events for fund raisers in the saloon and in the massive backyard, that is complete with a fabulous large stage. \n\nIn the second floor there are hostel rooms and a few full rooms. Different artists have themed many of the rooms, making it hard to choose a place to stay.  The 3rd & 4th floors are for longer term residents. \n\nIf you ever get a chance check the place out. Or if you have partied too hard downtown- stay for the night.",

Not as good as the ones I've had in LA but close 2nd\n\nOverall excellent flavors and very authentic.  Bill came out to be $32 bucks for 3 persons which I thought was very reasonable.

I would feel so embarrassed if I owned this restaurant. I mean, if you're literally right on the water, your seafood should be AMAZING. \n\nWe started with the fish dip, which was 2-3 stars. I've had much better fish dip elsewhere. I want delicious smoked fish flavor and I didn't get much of that at all. You know what I tasted? Weak fish flavor, no smoke, mayo, and the saltine crackers they serve it with. I had to drown it in lemon juice to make it taste like something. \n\nThen I got the grouper sandwich and my husband got the grouper wrap. EVEN. WORSE. Both of them. So, so, sooo bad. If I closed my eyes I literally wouldn't have been able to tell you I was eating seafood. It tasted like actual nothing. Cardboard and air. Again, drowned it in tartar sauce and lemon juice and still ended up leaving half of a piece of grouper in my basket. I'm sorry you had to die to become that sandwich, Mr. Grouper.

First of all, the lady on the phone had very poor English and a strong accent so we had an extremely hard time communicating and it was a struggle to even place my order. She had to pass the phone to someone else just to explain that I wanted to add mushrooms to my order. She abruptly hung up and I had to call back to ask about delivery time and cost of food. The food arrived pretty fast but wasn't great. My Shrimp in Garlic Sauce tasted strange... the whole dish had a fishy taste... we didn't enjoy it at all. The beef and broccoli was ok, so we only ate that. The fried rice was very bland and strange. It was yellowish rice with not one vegetable in sight. Not even an onion diced up in it. Very sub par Chinese food. So dissapointed! Order somewhere else if you want to enjoy your food. Sorry!",

Looking for activities to do in vacation (we couldn't be drinking hurricanes all the time after all), Cajun Encounters swamp tour was highly recommended. After all, what better way to run into a gator for a city boy like myself?\n\nAs soon as we boarded the shaded swamp boat, Captian Emmett had us in great spirits, letting the boat rip right out of the dock and into the swampy bayou. No sooner than 5 minutes in and coming up to the side of the boat was a six foot long gator. Fearlessly dangling a hot dog off the edge of the boat, Captain Emmett had our new aquatic friend jumping straight out of the water trying to get a bite of the hot dog (and maybe some of the Captian's finger too). Driving deeper into the swamp, we stopped six or seven more times to watch alligators, each one seemingly larger than the next one, lunging, snapping and lurking around the boat. \n\nAfter seeing the gators, we went further into the swamp, passing by prime waterfront property partly decimated by Katrina. Finally the boat idled into a shallow glade of trees where we were introduced to one of the greatest scourges of the south - feral pigs. As the pigs ambled up to the boat they started ramming the sides for food - Babe this was not. Explaining the total amount of destruction these big fellows do, everyone inched closer into the boat. A huge thank you to the Cajun Encounters staff and Captian Emmett for giving us a fantastic day in the swamp",

He is an amazing bartender and I'll follow him anywhere, but for my convenience I hope he stays there. \nThe food was so good too! I wish the menu had a little more but what we tried was wonderful.

Or someone's grandma's attic.  I didn't really feel a theme there.  This also carried over to the menu...I feel like there were many random seeming international sorts of options.  Maybe stick to stellar pizza or sandwich combos and keep it at that.  I think this place could benefit from some streamlining.\n\nOn to the food-we ordered a couple of obscure beers (both delicious), the beer battered mushrooms with gouda sauce, a fig and prosciutto pizza, and a special that evening, veggie gouda stuffed chicken (sense a theme?).  I particularly enjoyed the mushrooms and the pizza.  I also liked the chicken, but I think that this place would really shine if it stuck to more basic fare.  I could totally see myself coming here to grab some apps and drinks or maybe pizza or a sandwich.  Honestly, maybe it's the atmosphere that makes me feel like I shouldn't spend over $15 on an entree.  \n\nOne definite bright point in the evening was our waitress.  I found her to be friendly and attentive, without being overly so.",

You know you shouldn't but what the heck, you know it'll taste great. Enter Five Guys.\n\nMy goto burger is the cheese burger, you know the double paddy burger with cheese. On this night I went healthy and didn't add the bacon, lol. My toppings (there are14) are grilled onions, lettuce, tomato, and ketchup. We split a large fries, these are truly delicious when cooked right. If they cook them a little too long.....not so good. Anyway, this juicy concoction gets very messy but so what. It is the best burger you can buy at a so called fast food joint IMHO.\n\nBTW, other items on their limited menu are; Little cheese burgers ( only one patty) hotdogs, BLT, grilled cheese, and a veggie sandwich.\n\nSo go ahead, enjoy a Five Guy burger and all the free peanuts you can eat!",

Anyways, the take out order consisted of: kung pao chicken, chicken and broccoli, a side of pork fried rice, two egg rolls, and a ribs entree. It wasn't the best Chinese food I've had, but it was fine for what I wanted. \n\nEasy location to pick up the food too. I just parked right around the corner (double parked for .252 seconds) and went right in (since its located at the corner). The food was not expensive and I'd order from here again.",

  "text": "DISCLAIMER: This is more of a letter than a review. \n\n\nDear Ashley,\n\nI speak for my entire family when I say, THANK YOU!\n\nI get wild notions in my head sometimes and although for the most part I am a planner at my core, I am also helplessly impulsive. I want what I want when I want it and nothing can hold me back when I've made my mind up on something. \n\nI seriously had no intention of any vacations for the remainder of the year. I made an announcement to our family early in the year that family time will be limited to nearby weekend getaways. Tampa was not in the cards until one day I was watching a Hallmark movie with my wife and got the notion stuck in my head that I would like a family photo with my mother and sisters. After all, we hadn't had a professional picture done since we were kids. \n\nSo I called them, and suddenly the entire family was excited with the prospect of a beach photo shoot, including my grumpy but lovable brother-in-law who only likes to visit two places: His sofa and the golf range. I decided a family vacation was in order sooner than later since mom is getting up in age and Thanksgiving week gave us the best opportunity. Enter Ashley Izquierdo Photography. \n\n\n[ THE EXPERIENCE ]\n\nAfter trying to schedule a session with another photographer, but never receiving a call back, I discovered your page on yelp and liked what I saw. I was surprised that you didn't realize you had any reviews on yelp, but at the time all three reviews were 5 stars. \n\nNever having worked with a professional before, I was surprised by a few requirements, such as paying in full for my session up front and the minimum guarantee of 45 good photos, but you worked with me to ease my mind and I appreciated you efforts. So many bad stories of prepaying a business for services that are never rendered was a stressful thought for me. I also REALLY, REALLY appreciated how you were lightening fast in responding to my texts as we kept in touch for nearly a month prior to our session. Many times I could see you were typing just seconds after I sent a message. That comforted my anxiety about paying upfront without knowing you (more than you can imagine). \n\nAlso I appreciate your being on time for our session and the extra effort you made in taking specific photos I requested. While you said our session would be available in your gallery in about 2 to 3 weeks, I was delighted they were ready in just a matter of days. I know I called worried because I had trouble opening the files on my moms archaic computer... but once I was back home in Atlanta, viewing them was a snap. \n\n\n[ FINAL THOUGHTS ] \n\nMy entire family (including those whom saw the pictures but were not there for the session) LOVED your work! At first I thought $350 was pricey since I am good with a camera and could have done the session myself with a tripod, but it was money well spent and I'm so happy to have made your acquaintance. \n\nMy only suggestion is don't take things to heart so easily. Some people (such as myself) calling to hire you don't know protocol or procedure when it comes to professional photography. Therefore, sometimes a question is just a question... not an attack that you must defend. I truly wish you much success in your future! You are very good at what you do and deserve all the business Yelp can send your way. While we were just a simple 1 hour photo session, your wedding & engagement pics in your online gallery are STUNNING, and your reviews on sites like The Knot & Wedding Wire speak volumes about your talent and professionalism. \n\nI hope you enjoyed working with us as much as we did with you! Happy to be your first Yelp sale! \n\n\nThanks again,\nRichard & Family\n\n\n2019/8",

  "text": "Good experience tonight. We got an email blast that they were featuring 8$ dinners for three specific entrees. 6 ounce sirloin, blackened tilapia, & Chicken Bella were the choices, we both ordered the sirloin medium and it came with two sides. I got mashed potatoes and a side garden salad. Husband had grilled zucchini & mashed potatoes. \n\nWe ordered a happy hour spinach dip for 4$ on the special Happy Hour menu.  I figured they would short portion it, but the serving was quite generous. Husband tried the 3$ margarita and upgraded to a large mai tai and he reports both drinks were excellent. That's high praise from a bartender with 35 years experience. Happy Hour runs from 4-6 and we sat at the bar- I'm not sure if you could get those drink prices at the table. \n\nThe food was very enjoyable. My only suggestion would be not to serve a small sirloin on a mammoth plate, because it makes it look even smaller. I felt the mashed potatoes could have been served hotter, but they were tasty. Silverware was sparkling clean.",

We were happy that the restaurant was full and just loud enough that we could have our own conversation without others being able to eavesdrop despite the small dining room.\n\nThe service was attentive, which is a huge factor in the overall enjoyment of a meal out.  The wait staff was personal and informative.\n \nWe ordered two of the special small plates, sardines and calamari with gnocchi.  The sardines had a bit of the flavor of the gas grill, but the calarmari was unbelievable as were our other dishes.  The sausage was excellent with a lot of flavor and a huge portion.  The pasta was cooked to perfection and the pesto had just the right amount of texture.  We also loved out whole fish.  Delicious!\n\nWhile we are not generally dessert eaters, the waiter brought over some zeppolis on the house.  They were hot, vanilla flavored and delicisous.  As a matter of fact, all of our food was piping hot, which is another key factor to an excellent meal.\n\nOne cannot get food like this anywhere else in South Jersey.  Zeppoli is a treasure!",

  "text": "Kim's is good for Northeast Philly. Came for a friend's birthday with a group of 6. Two of them are frequenters of Kim's so we followed their lead. We got seafood pancake, soondubu, two orders of kalbi, cow tongue, and pork belly. I've had better seafood pancake and soondubu elsewhere, so my recommendation is stick with the BBQ meat! For 2 orders of kalbi, it ran about $56. It isn't the typical thick meat I was use to, but rather more like bulgogi thin slices (unless they got our order messed up, not sure). The flavor was good though. The pork belly was eh, I had better elsewhere. I do however highly recommend the cow tongue! It doesn't sound very good, but if you don't think about what you are eating, it is actually surprisingly VERY GOOD!! I don't think it is a very popular option, so if you are ever at Kim's.. order it!! \n\nThey give you free ice cream which you scoop yourself. That was an interesting concept. Be prepared to smell like smoke because the second you walk in, you will get a whiff of it. They have a small parking lot, but more likely than not, it will be full, but there is plenty of nearby street parking. If you are in the mood for soondubu, go to the other tofu place nearby (forgot the name, sorry!)",

The local pottery art for sale on the walls gives it a uniqueness that feels like home; the cool feature walls give it an artistic modern feel; and the outdoor seating creates a welcoming presence. But enough to about the decor. \nThe food totally blew us away!  sitting down we took a look around and saw what other people were ordering and we ended up ordering the same dishes as the gals next to us. We had the pho with extra veggies- well worth it to get more veg. The lentil loaf with amazing mashed potatoes and apple chia sauce- this one was surprisingly a favourite and voted top at our table of all the things we tried. As well we ordered the raw zucchini pasta- it was super savoury and the only thing I'll make note of is to ask for a little less sauce. \nDrinks! We had a super delightful peppermint cocao latte- such a delight to the eyes and tastebuds. And the matcha latte one of the best we've ever had- we highly recommend it with cashew milk. \nAll in all- well worth checking out- make sure you take some time to see their deserts they change everyday and are displayed in a case at the front.",

  "text": "3.5 yelps. So it seems like our experience was not the norm and that's unfortunate for us. Seeing all of the other rave reviews makes me want to head back and see if the Sunday when we dined was just a rare fluke. I feel like we were jipped out of this amazing experience everyone else had. We were so excited to treat my parents to this meal. We were a tad embarrassed about how it turned out....\n\nRight off the bat, ordering was fairly difficult. They did not speak one word of English. Many mistakes were made and any special requests we had were unable to be fulfilled because of the language barrier. We spoke with two individuals, neither understood us. At all. I think that unfortunately set the tone for the meal. \n\nWe had a larger party and below is what everyone had to say. I personally can only comment on the mushroom tofu soup which I actually really loved and am totally craving right now after looking over my photos. The scallion pancakes were a tad soggy and lacking in flavor for me and the dumplings were just ok. I've had better. A tad too slippery and slimy for my taste. The plain rice was so delicious for some reason. Piping hot. Yum. \n\n3 yelps Beef soup. Not enough beef. Banchan Sides were good. Ribs were good. Chicken was just alright. \n\n3 yelps seafood tofu soup just two shrimp (one with eyeballs) Barely any seafood. \"Floating yuck\". Beef was really good. Chicken was just ok. \"$12 for a bowl of tofu?\"  Dumplings were good. A little mushy. \n\n2 yelps they don't have anything for kids. \n\n4 yelps Excellent rice plains and simple. \n\n3 yelps mushroom tofu soup was very good. Beef was the best out of everything. Chicken was average. \n\n3.5 yelps Chicken was not BBQ as stated. \nScallion pancakes weren't crisp, were too greasy and a tad bland. \n\nTons of food so think twice when ordering. Don't forget about all of the side that come first. The place was pretty cute. A nice find for the area. I think everyone could appreciate the authenticity of the meal for example the raw egg to place in our soon du bu, but Something just wasn't happening the way we had hoped and the way it seemed to for others.",

It was a Saturday afternoon so the door was open and the sun was shining in. It was pretty much the perfect New Orleans afternoon. \n\nI sat down and ordered the Lavender Lace from their signature cocktails menu. The Lavender Lace is a Champagne Cocktail with Housemade Lavender Bitters and it is fresh and flavorful, and clearly got the job done after two or three of them. The place is sort of divey but has a flair to it too. \n\nBart Ramsey was the musician during my visit. He is a local jazz musician with his own music, and of course, did some covers. The crowd was all relaxed, taking in some cocktails and jazz. Some were grabbing a bite, but just drinks for me, so I can't review the food. \n\nI'm not sure if it traps tourists, but it didn't seem to be one of those places. It was sort of down from all of the touristy stuff on Frenchmen. I dug it and if you visit, you will too!",

It's dark and weathered on the inside with years of bar smoke yellowing the blinds lett you know, \"we've been around the block\" and it looks it. A bar that seats around 15 a table and some booths in the main room that looks into a very small kitchen (partially explanes the long wait times). The second room seats more and adds some attractions, Ms. PAC-MAN, Air Hockey and shuffleboard which unfortunately was ocupado. \n\nWe placed out order in the proper order, beer then pizza. Mac was supper helpful in the kitchen. When quoted 45min for our two pies, she proclaimed \"I'm fast. It won't be that long\" and it was not. With the game room filled with all 21 and up, thank you, we grabbed stools at the bar and began chatting up the Norms. About 30 minutes later we were out the door with one Chicago and one thin together with a large salad for around $40. Not bad when you consider the amount of food in one of the ChiTown delights. Four of us finished of 1 round with another sitting in the fridge for breakfast. \n\nThe bottom line is I liked the pizza but not enough to spend all night in the Black Thorn Pub. That's not because of it's appearance, I'm totally down with a dive but I did not get the cool, dive vibe. Maybe it's better on the weekend when it's packed to the walls.

The bar, the floors, the walls, ceilings, lighting, fixtures - everything - this interior has always deserved better.\n\nBetter management, better clientele (a loyal one at that), a good menu, a good concept.

First, the menu is WAY too big - wayyy too many items on there. There are a bunch of sandwiches, home-y, comfort food, plates and pizzas, too?  That is way too much.  I understand the intent, a menu to please all palates and offer all things, but a menu can't always be everything to everyone, and when it does that, it will always fall short in its execution.   I always find the smaller the menu options, the better the kitchen, and usually the better the food.  The end.\n\nI didn't experiment with the cocktails, although I wanted to, Michelle C. wisely steered me away.  I stuck to a whiskey as I thought I should, and the bartender suggested one for my bourbon/whiskey neophyte self.  The selection, even at a one ounce pour was expensive, but smooth and went down easy.  Lots of nice beers on tap too, which is a must in this neighborhood.  The food as expected wasn't bad, but it wasn't great and pretty boring too.\n\nA pork belly bahn mi sliders were just okay, too much bread, or too little pork belly - and the big slice of jalapeno seemed to overwhelm the small sliders.  The portions for the big plates, are HUGE - massive really - totally generous, but really, I think, too big.  The shepherd pie was ho-hum, much like all others, except that there was one huge briney olive in the lamb stew mix (which I wasn't sure was intended or not) and the fish and chips was nice, flakey but both nothing to write home about.  \n\nI find it promising that B&B is trying to find and create its own niche and with live music upstairs that might prove to be key - If the menu was revised to be smaller, more cohesive and more appealing I could be tempted to return and because I want businesses to succeed in my neighborhood, I will return - I just hope the whole place revisits its approach, menu and concept cocktails.  The place deserves it.",

First, the service was very inattentive so that we felt neglected as we slowly pined away without water refills or air in the corner of the overheating restaurant.  Secondly, the food was very salty.\n\nWe started with the Zucchini/Escargot special (which we thought was just a Zucchini dish...so we had a little unexpected protein).  The dish really ended up having more cheese than vegetable, so it was like a gourmet mozzarella stick.  \n\nHalf-sized portions of pasta are available (but not as an entree), so I sampled the Gnocchi with crab meat - it was in a tasty sauce that overhwelmed the flavor of the crab.\n\nFor my entree, I ordered \"Goat in the Style of a Horse\", which was a completely unenlightening description, but had come highly recommended.  This was a good dish with tender meat, but it also had too much salt (especially with no water in my glass...)",

The interior is very unique and the food was delicious.  Aside from the price, I guess, my main complaints were that the waitress was a bit slow at first, the parking is tight, and the exterior certainly doesn't let you know that this was a very classy restaurant.  The pros outweigh the cons though. Great food and chill place to go on a date or have a meeting. It's very relaxed. I like this place a lot.  If it weren't overpriced, I would be here everyday, but since it is, I will just have to settle for a few times a month :P\n\nI got the Fuji gyoza, miso soup, and cheek dancer maki roll.  My brother got the spicy tuna maki roll, brown rice, and a chicken terriyaki skewer appetizer.  For this simple dinner, it was $48. I guess, it wasn't too expensive, but I think Samurai would have been a bit lower.  Especially if I got salmon teriyaki, which was maybe $10 more than at Samurai.  Its on par with the quality food with Azie on Main but the restaurant isnt as chic which is why its slightly lower in price from Azie on Main by a few bucks. The prices aren't too too bad, just a tad higher than I figured it should be.  The sushi was very fresh and worth it...",

  "text": "The area around Frenchmen St. reminds me a little bit of Little Five Points in Atlanta. You definitely get that eclectic, hipster vibe. Just walking down the street was an amazing experience where every single restaurant had a different jazz band playing. Everyone's doors are open so you can peek in and listen to the music of Nola for a few moments as you pass by.\n\nThe food was delicious, although the fries were nothing special. I particularly enjoyed the Scallops dish as they were perfectly cooked, and you can't go wrong with the Pork Belly. Service was great; our waiter was attentive, really sweet, and definitely laid back. \n\nAlthough we were limited to our table for 1.5 hours, my dad and I easily transitioned to the bar to enjoy the rest of the jazz lineup. The evening I was at Three Muses, they had 3 local bands, the first one starting at 5 PM. Chris Peters opened for the first hour. I'd say the genre was folk-indie. It was AWESOME. You get to eat and watch local singer-songwriters play right in front of you. The second group, Hot Club of New Orleans (jazz genre), well...these guys, they were AMAZING. They played for a couple of hours, and I wish I had stayed for the 9 PM performance, but I had other things planned by then. Honestly, it was the music that made everything better.",

I went in with a tourist friend of mine late last year only to run out very quickly when my guest decided it was appropriate to pull out a Bud Light lime from her bag and pop the top. Luckily I was afforded the opportunity to go back last weekend and enjoy dinner with a friend who does not carry her own bar in her handbag. As we sat down, a waitress came over and told us that we were to order at the bar. I knew this was the policy but found it funny that during the course of the night she never let us actually order at the bar. She always came to our table to see if we wanted anything. This was probably because we were in early before the music started. I'm sure they are more strict about the bar ordering policy when it is crowded later during the evening. They had six beers on tap, including two NOLA brewery and two Abita beers which was a major plus. I had an Old-Fashioned and while it wasn't the best I've ever had, it certainly held its own. We ordered lamb sliders, feta fries, rosemary cashews, and goat enchiladas. I loved the fries and the slider, which after eating I found I was too full to eat anything else. Overall, Three Muses is a great place to enjoy a more sophisticated night on Frenchmen Street. I'm holding out my fifth star until I try the Mac and Cheese.",

Yes. I felt that needed to be said. But don't let that discourage you because they have an awesome sale section. It's pretty effing huge. The only downside is  that I almost never find anything I want in the sale rack. I'd made a trip in here a couple of times with my roommate but never bought anything, just browsed the sale section. \n\nI really REALLY love the customer service. When I tried on my dress, they wrote my name in erasable ink on a little oval mirror/plaque outside of my dressing room and they referred to me by my name the whole time. It was a little unusual at first because I am not used to being called by my name while trying on clothes by people I don't know, but I think that's what's so great about it. No other store (that I know of) does it, at least not in the US. \n\nFinally, I decided to buy my first item there and they gave me a card to fill out that allows for easier returns and I think on your birthday you get some kind of discount... (?) And all the while I was talking to the woman at the register about how to coordinate the dress and she said for me to come back sometime soon so they can see my outfit. :) The only other place where I've been told that was at a Japanese brand store in Sapporo when I was living over there. I like it when employees show interest in their customers' coordinates. :D\n\nFinally, I must mention the quality....it's pretty darn good! The dress I got is very soft but also thick and very well tailored. The tag says made in China, yes, but it's still very well constructed. Don't let it bother you! I've ordered garments custom made from select factories in China and they have all done stellar work. (TaoBao, for anyone who is wondering.)  Also Anthropologie carries a pretty wide variety of \"brands\" in the store so there's usually something for everyone. \n\nI don't see many 20-something-year-olds shopping in here. It's a shame. Their quality is far better than stores like Hollister and the customer service is great too. I get that the prices can be a bit much but if you restrict yourself to sale areas you can get stuff for $20!!!!\n\nAlso I must say the comment on here about the store having a smaller selection than the website is kind of out of date....because the store is HUGE and there is by far WAY more stuff in the store than on the website!",

Their grilled calamari was also good - nice charred flavoring, while at the same time retaining a moist, springy-but-not-chewy texture.\n\nService was quick and efficient, if not overly familial. Suggestions came out quickly, along with answers to any questions we had. Bottles were opened when they needed to be, water was poured when it was empty, nd empty bottles were taken away.\n\nAll in all, this place is nice - cozy and quaint.

We brought our own bottle of wine and and come to find out it's $25 for the corkage fee!  Yikes.  After debating whether or not to purchase one of their bottles of wine, order wine by the glass, or swallow the fee, I decided to talk with the Manager, Jeff.

Score!  What a nice guy, he was nothing but attentive the whole time, said he's worked there for 26 years.  \n\nOur meals were absolutely delicious.

We only got take out but everything was well prepared, properly spiced and well served. They did give me chicken vindaloo instead of lamb but I was not about to hike back down Marlton Pike to have it corrected, talk about a jacked up road. Car suspension preservation is greater than lamb cravings.\n\nThe chicken makhani, garlic naan, rice, samosas and accompanying sauces were all on point. I look forward to the dining in version for sho! Hands down the best take out I have had since moving here 2 weeks ago.",

  "text": "The Rusty Pelican has a beautiful view of Tampa Bay. We sat at a window seat and looked out at the water. It was very peaceful. The interior is nicely decorated with ornate furniture and table linens.  You can eat at the bar or in the restaurant. There is a banquet hall for large events as well.\n\nThe service was professional and attentive. The atmosphere was tranquil. The food..... Wellll, leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nWe went for Sunday Brunch. You know us ladies Love Brunchin' on a Sunday! The  shrimp pasta left a lot to be desired with its overcooked shrimp. The ceviche lacked flavor and seasoning. Here are some of the highlights for me.  The Asian slaw - pretty good. The cheese grits - nice and cheesy and delicious. The sausage on the buffet - yummy. The waffles - delicious with that warm syrup and whiskey butter. My first cup of coffee was served with milk that curdled when you poured it in the hot coffee. They redeemed it with a fresh cup of coffee with fresh cream. It was a pretty good cup of coffee. You get limitless mimosas with the brunch. There is Not an option to deduct it from the price. You're gonna pay for it whether you want it or not so ya might as well drink up. Prepare to the pay $50 per person.  Honestly, I've had better brunches. Go for the view, the atmosphere, and the service not for the brunch..maybe lunch or dinner.",

  "text": "I hate writing these kind of reviews, because I do not want to come off as a jerk, but I really need to share this.\n\nMy husband and I have eaten at the Italian Barrel on several occasions. The last being our wedding anniversary. The place is cute, the atmosphere is romantic, and the food is AMAZING. We're both vegetarians, so it's hard to find delicious food in the quarter that isn't Mediterranean or pizza. My husband can't stop raving  about the porcini and truffle ravioli, and I am fairly obsessed with their orange Grand Marnier sorbetto. Their cheese plates go on for days and are very different from any of the other ones offered in the city. \n\n\"Why, my dear are you giving this place only three stars, Andrea?\" you may be asking. Here's why: My husband and I feel that we get worse service than other customers. The place is tiny, so it's pretty obvious.  We are both tattooed but always wear really nice clothes (it was our anniversary!!) and tip very well (usually 20-35 percent, depending on how many cocktails we have had). Our waiter on 2 occasions did not give us the same quality of service as the other (older and ritzier) patrons. We were not read the specials, my questions were answered curtly, and we were not checked on often. It was pretty irritating, considering we were spending almost 80 bucks on a dinner, and it is one of our favorite places to eat. Maybe we came on a bad night? Maybe our table was for someone coming in soon? I will probably keep going here because the food is so delicious, but it's upsetting, nonetheless.",

  "text": "Great way to end a biz trip?  $5 martinis!\n\nThanks to the suggestion of locals, we were so happy to hear that Roxy offered a pretty great happy hour - $5 martinis from 5 - 6:30.  Awesome!  The bar is tucked in a back corner of the casino (it seemed that way anyway).  We were greeted by the lively piano singer and super friendly bartenders.\n\nThe martini selection is intense.  There are soooo many flavors/combinations - birthday cake, pomegranate, martinis made with tequila.  It was great to just look through the menu!  I was torn between a gin/Campari mix and a Makers martini (aka Kentucky), but the bartender ultimately swayed me to get the Makers one.  Can't go wrong with that, right?\n\nThey also serve up the full restaurant menu, so you don't need to move to the restaurant if you're just looking for something chill.  We settled on some apps - the duck spring rolls (yum!) and the calamari.  All delish and awesome prices.  (Reno, you are amazing for having some low food prices!)\n\nIf I'm ever back in Reno, I will definitely be sure to return for another lovely Kentucky martini.",

Next for pizza, I appreciate TOPPINGS, TOPPINGS, and did I say TOPPINGS? Seriously this pizza is packed to the GILLS, with more toppings than I ever seen put on a pizza, thin crispy crust, and delicious combinations. My PERSONAL FAVORITE is CHUCK's SPECIAL. Prices are higher, but the VALUE is there, because you get some SERIOUS HEAVYWEIGHT CONTENDER food that is ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! The Potatoes are good, super greasy, but great. Chicken wings average.

The gumbo was completely under-seasoned.  No utensils provided in a to-go order.  Some of the most disappointing Creole/Cajun food I've ever had and absolutely not worth the wait.\n\nSwing by here for a few drinks and get a little rowdy / listen to some tunes / have some fun.

  "text": "During my time in Philly, I've gone out to Fuji Mountain a couple of times to grab some sushi. Being a huge sushi fan and having eaten high-quality sushi in big cities, I was a bit wary of seeing how this would  stack up against what I'd had in the past. But my girlfriend vouched for the quality of their sushi, and no doubt - this isn't your standard generic sushi restaurant with less-than-fresh fish. All of the nigiri is fresh, and the rolls themselves are delicious as well. In particular, I was a big fan of the Cheek Dance roll; it doesn't try to stuff too many different fish and sauces in it, and it has two of my favorites (eel and yellowtail) in it as well. The only downside is that, as with many sushi spots I visit, they rolls have a bit too much rice in them for my liking. The first time we came here, we ended up getting completely stuffed because we overestimated the size of the rolls we ordered.\n\nThe interior atmosphere is very nice; you have high wooden ceilings and lots of traditional decor around. The service is very good, and you get your food in a timely fashion. Whenever we've gone on a weekend evening, it's never been terribly crowded...it's definitely a nice spot to hit up in the suburbs if you're looking for a relaxed dinner setting. And good sushi!",

The burrito was solid, but not remarkable, but I would definitely eat it again.\n\nOne super pro about this restaurant is that there are tons of vegetarian options that won't make veggies feel like they're missing out.  My vegetarian friend tried his first enchilada with rice and beans here and thought it was delicious.  Definitely a great choice in lieu of a traditional Sunday brunch place",

  "text": "Endless Summer is one of the top dinner locations I suggest whenever I have family, friends, and other Yelpers visiting in town. It it right on the harbor so you can check out the boats, see some sea life, and enjoy the ocean views. The decor is insanely representational of Santa Barbara culture. And the food options are well diverse, somewhat affordable, and extremely delicious. \n\nI have been coming here for years, but my most recent visit was the best and most memorable of them all. My housemates and I stopped by for dinner and drinks on the night of my birthday and it was packed. While wait staff were running around frantically helping all the guests the hostess was trying to touch base with all them while also cleaning newly vacant tables and seating guests, we thought maybe another restaurant would be a better choice. After maybe 90 seconds of standing there, though, the hostess ran up to us and kindly offered to seat us right then apologizing for the chaos.\n\nWe got our seats, grabbed some popcorn while we waited, ordered drinks and food, and went to play pool on the deck while our food was being made. Pool did cost a little bit but with the free popcorn and decently priced Happy Hour drinks it was well worth the experience. The sunset over the water was gorgeous and we were loving the active crowd. \n\nAbout 25 minutes later we hear our names over the loud speaker and find out we have to go pick up our food at the window.. not sure if it is always like this, because we were not at our table, or it was super busy but none the less we picked it up and went to our seats no problem. I ordered the Seafood Louie Salad and it was probably the best/biggest salad I have ever had. I am not a Huge seafood person either but I was won over by this one for sure.\n\nAfter we finished we grabbed boxes because their portions are so generous and then they came out with a massive mud pie topped with lit candles for my birthday surprise dessert. Best. Birthday. Dessert. Ever. It was massive too! Our table went to town on it thanking our waitress over and over again. The bill came shortly after and full tummies we stumbled out saying many thanks to all the hard working staff.\n\nThat's just one of the many situations here where the staff have been over worked yet extremely kind and on the ball. The food is always delicious as well and the portions will have you full for days. If you're not looking for a meal, come here Happy Hour and enjoy the harbor views. I'll definitely be back for that soon!",

I usually try to skip & forget that one day of the year that references to my age and that time waits for no one.\n\nI walked into this location and was immediately greeted by 2 or 3 employees with a friendly \"Welcome to Starbucks\", which I have never experienced at none of the other locations! It was around 11pm and coffee shop was moderately busy and most of the seats were taken by folks actually drinking their coffee and talking to each other and not distracted by some form of electronic device.\n\nI walked to the counter and explained to the employee  (I think it was Amy) that it was my birthday and I wanted to place an order for a Java Chip Frap. She wished me a happy birthday with a smile, asked for my favorite Starbucks Gold card. Other employee's heard her and also made a point to stop what they were doing and say happy birthday! I think its the most happy birthdays that I have ever got in one day :) ! It only took the employee a few minutes to get right on my drink making it and in my hands with another \"I hope you have a wonderful birthday\", which I really appreciated!\n\nThe store was very neat and the floors looked like they were just mopped, hard to believe with the amount of traffic that was in the store. The counters were stocked and everything was in place. If I didnt live 30 minutes away I would make this my new favorite Starbuck (Store cleanliness 5 stars). The Ambiance was really nice and laid back, there wasn't any loud music and the other customers didnt have to yell to talk to each other. I got the vibe that I could sit and just chill which I will make a point to do next time I pass by! Thanks for the great experience.",

  "text": "Dosa Hut & Chat House is a bit of a conundrum. On one hand the food is excellent. Supremely fresh and with a variety of Indian dishes that you may not find elsewhere. If you grow tired of chicken tikka, butter chicken, and other items you'll find en masse at other Indian restaurants, Dosa Hut is a great place to visit. Given the name, you'd expect that the dosas, utappams, and chats are prepared quite well and indeed they are. You really won't go wrong with any of them. The curries are also consistently tasty, but not the best I've ever had. For what you get, I think the pricing is a tad high but is not unreasonable.\n\nWhere I have trouble giving DH&CH 5 stars is the service and environment. On a Friday, during lunch--which you'd imagine is the busiest period during the entire week--they had ONE employee staffing the entire dining room of 40 or so patrons. With the entire dining room filled up (so much so that we actually shared a table with other people) and other patrons waiting outside for a seat to open up, with one guy waiting on the entire room made it difficult to get any service. Speaking of the dining room, it consists of high stainless steel tables, swivel chairs probably from a discount hotel furniture store, and styrofoam/plastic dining ware.\n\nI think I'd peg DH&CH at 3.5 stars.... the food really is excellent and I have no reservations about heading back frequently, but they really need to bring the other aspects of the experience up to the same level as the cuisine. That being said, my official Yelp ranking will be 4 because it's great to have tasty and different Indian food in the area.",

  "text": "Excellent service but underwhelming food for the price, Fleming's is only average when I was expecting extraordinary.\n\nIn the past, I used to be pretty skeptical of steakhouses, as I never thought the quality of the food offered justified the cost. Turns out, I was just going to the wrong places, and now I'm more than willing to spend a pretty penny on a great steak. This chain steakhouse in Radnor is located in what appears to be the first floor of an office building. They have complimentary valet parking or you can just park anywhere in the lot next door. The interior is absolutely massive, easily seating several hundred people, and the dress code is more formal than casual (otherwise you my get some looks). \n\nMy girlfriend and I ordered the Newport Filet Mignon (6oz) with Fleming's potatoes, the Certified Angus Beef Block-Cut Craftsman Ribeye (11oz), and the Chipotle Cheddar Mac & Cheese. If you're wondering on prices, the steaks run $45-$55 apiece and the mac & cheese is close to $20. Overall, I wasn't too impressed with the steaks we had. Despite ordering them medium, the steaks came out closer to medium-well, not enough to send back but enough to notice. The outside of the steaks were also a bit too charred for my taste, resulting in a chewy steak. The Filet Mignon was definitely the better of the two. The Ribeye was a leaner cut of meat than your usual Ribeye (something the waitress pointed out to her credit), so if you're a fan of a traditional Ribeye you may be disappointed. It wasn't bad for a leaner cut of meat, but still suffered from the previous ailments mentioned. The Mac & Cheese was the most disappointing. They attempted that baked breaded top, which just dried out the top layer of pasta, and the actual cheese, instead of being creamy and smooth, was clumpy and watery.\n\nOverall, Fleming's unfortunately seems to confirm my past suspicions. From my experiences, the food is not nearly at the quality it should be for a nearly $200 meal. I will say the service was spectacular, as our waitress was extremely knowledgeable about the menu, and honestly saves this place from two star territory. There are better steakhouses for your money.",

  "text": "--- Short Synopsis ---\n\nGood lunch buffet with nice, light, complimentary naan bread!!! My favorites were the chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, the methi matar goshi, and the rice pudding out of the available items. The first three went great with rice or naan bread. \n\nAlso, there is a great ambiance to the restaurant with the decor and bollywood music playing in the background!! I will come back here when I crave more Indian cuisine!!\n\n--- Detailed Review ---\n\nI came here for the lunch buffet and enjoyed my experience here.\n\nThe complimentary naan bread was thinner than I am use to, but still good and goes well with many of the buffet choices available. I did have to ask the waiter for the naan refills, so be prepared to do that if you'd like more.  \n\nThe chicken tikka masala had a nice subtle sweet coconut taste along with chunks of chicken that made it delectable. The methi matar goshi also had a subtle sweet, nutty flavor that I really enjoyed. These two items, the chicken tikka masala and methi matar goshi, were my two favorite items offered at the buffet. The tandoori chicken was good as well.\n\nTo spice things up, they have a hot chili pepper sauce available along with a yogurt sauce, sweet n sour sauce, and onion chutney. These were located near the plates and sauce plates at the buffet table.\n\nThe buffet style and layout of choices allow you to create your own dish of what you like. Oh, the countless combinations you can make! This means you can try a little of everything on your first go around and then get what you really enjoy. With two types of rice and the naan bread, you have some options as far as what to put the other goods on.\n\nFor the ambiance, they have bollywood style music playing in the background along with nice Indian looking decor around the dining areas. These provide for a nice setting to enjoy Indian cuisine. They also have TV's that showed music videos, although the videos were a tad strange to me coming from a different culture. \n\nAs it currently stands, it is $11 per person for the lunch buffet and it is worth it for the food and ambiance you receive.\n\nI recommend this place and will come back to satisfy my Indian cravings.",

  "text": "SERVER REVIEW  only at a belated birthday celebration (Thurs night with a $10 coupon in hand). \n\nWow, Carol was NOT a good server.  Probably one of the worst I've had, and I dine out A LOT!    This was the general consensus of our whole table of four.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was her impatience when our last party hadn't arrived yet (after 15 minutes).   I told her that my friend was on her way, but I knew what she wanted.  My request was to please give her five more minutes.  \n\nWe all ordered then, including our missing party's order.\n\nOur meals came out in a timely manner.   Our last party member arrived in perfect timing!  \n\nWhen I asked Carol to take a picture of us, she responded \"okay, but it'll have to be quick because that table is waiting to place their order.\"  REALLY?  In my opinion, she could have thought that, but didn't have to SAY it!  RUDE! \n\nOur food was plentiful and absolutely delicious AS ALWAYS.  The darling little older man visited our tables, as most (probably all) others.  We complimented him on our food and chatted a bit.  \n\nMy one friend wanted to place a take out order for her children, as she told Carol earlier on.\n\nShe placed it, no problem.\n\nAs Carol came over to our table again (we saw her coming towards us, with how our chairs were turned), she ROLLED HER EYES (two of us caught that) when (the ordering) one friend turned a certain way and Carol accidentally hit her shoulder. \n\nNo apology or anything.    WOWEE!!!!!!   \n\nHer very small tip reflected our thoughts.  I have never posted, nor name dropped a server until now.     \n\nIf you can't stand the heat, literally get out of the kitchen!",

  "text": "I have been eating here for years upon years. When I cannot get off campus to Shere-E-Punjab, this is my go-to spot. \n\nAnd since the renovation of last year or so, the space and -- somehow -- the service have improved substantially. My favorite about the new space: gorgeous windows that let in natural, bright light, and I've developed quite the affinity for the bright green chairs there. \n\nWhat to know? \n\nThis is a small, super casual and speedy restaurant. And, after placing your order, you can be sure that your food will be prepped and ready to go within 10 minutes or so. \n\nMy favorite is the saag. Doesn't matter if you have it with chicken, paneer or whatever else, the dish always carries a lovely flavor, with a hint of mustard seed. Nice. \n\nBut where are the issues? \n\nThe place can get crammed very quickly during the lunch rush. That makes for too many awkward situations. \n\nAlso, the veggie samosas and the tikka masala are strangely flat on the flavor. Just...not interesting at all. \n\nI hear the tikka masala is the most popular dish. How?! There is SO MUCH MORE going on with the menu offerings, I cannot believe the tikka is the go-to item here. The tomato sauce flavor is strong with this one. \n\nThe bonuses?\n\nI've had great luck with the curry and korma. The aloo matar and the biryani are also quite nice. \n\nAnd the Q-roll -- brilliant addition! It's yummy, spice-enduced flavor wrapped in a thin bread-like tortilla with crisp lettuce and this glorious sauce. Seriously?! Perfect for lunch. Try the lamb and haryali rolls. Yum-yum. \n\nAlso important to note: You have the option of mild, medium or spicy. I tend to go with medium, but find that I often wish I had gone a bit more spicy than that. I was raised in Los Angeles. Tobasco sauce is a fun flavor additive. Dave's Insanity offers just an enjoyable rise. (\"Give me the habanero, I say, or give me death!\") So, for me, the spice often runs mild and dry at Kababeque. \n\nWhat else is important to mention? The favorite and enjoyable naan!\n\nYou have the option of plain naan, or a whole selection of flavorings, like cheese, japapeno, lamb, aloo and other naans. Seems the garlic naan is pretty popular here. I have not tried anything other than the plain naan. It's pretty amazing. The size of two adult faces for a little more than $2. Nice pricing there. \n\nSo, yes, highly recommended, especially if you are on campus or visiting campus.",

Apparently this location is a bit more of an \"evening spot\" and doesnt have the same charm as their location on Royal Street. Would recommend the other location for breakfast and sitting and this one to go.\n\n------\n\nLooking for a beignet fix without the wait?  Cafe Beignet serves 'em up hot for a great price in a beautiful setting.  Find a spot in the courtyard and enjoy your food under the shade of the Louisiana State Courthouse. Or take your food to go as you stroll around town! \n\nAll of their menu items are less than $10 but some are a little ridiculously priced - $9 for a cup of gumbo? I mean it's delicious and I want it and I will absolutely still buy it, but i could buy 12 beignets for that price! They serve a great standard breakfast (think bagels, waffles, omlettes, etc.) on top of authentic Nawlins specials like red beans and rice, jamablaya, gumbo, and muffalettas.  \n\nI've come here every time I've been to New Orleans, and I'm always pleased. Even in the busiest seasons, they have friendly and fast service, and their food maintains its quality.  Definitely worth visiting if you're looking for something off the beaten path.",

My party of 5 was seated right away at one of the high tables outside.  \n\nThe fried ravioli seemed to me like glorified mozzarella sticks, but the bruschette was great - thick slices of crusty break topped with ripe tomatoes, really fresh shredded basil, and parmesan.

It was pretty good, but as a former professional pizza artist, I have a few complaints: the crust was thin but a little soggy, it seemed like there was barely any tomato sauce on the pizza, and the toppings weren't evenly distributed.  \n\nWe skipped the list of 120 different wines and went for the happy hour 2 for 1 draft Yazoo served in little jars.

Their entrees are decent but they have an awesome happy hour! Anytime i can get a good buzz and get full for under $20, it's a win! They have large, tasty appetizers and cocktails apart of the happy hour that start at $4. The burger is good, flatbreads, and shrimp are good.  Remember, it's only available in the bar area and patio. Some of the dishes are kind of salty but they still taste great.",

  "text": "Brand new elegant steakhouse situated inside the Bacara Resort in Santa Barbara. Executive Chef Vincent comes from a background of having worked at 3-Star Michelin restaurants in France. Would highly recommend the two hour trek to get here from L.A. for the food alone + Breathtaking views from the patio and a menu that delivers real Certified Kobe Beef from Japan at $20 an ounce (3 oz minimum order). Never have I tasted beef that oozes of juiciness and melts in your mouth like that Kobe. \n\nIt is a steakhouse after all in which I recommend sticking to as many meat products as possible such as the super fresh Beef Tartare as a starter served with potato crisp, black garlic, egg yolk, spinach. Or the Roasted Bone Marrow - oxtail marmalade, pistachio gremolata, herbs, grilled sourdough, better than any other version of marrow.\n\nTheir steaks come with optional SAUCES: béarnaise, red wine sauce, assorted peppercorn sauce, horseradish crème fraîche, beurre blanc, Angel Oak steak sauce similar to A1.\n\nHOUSE BUTTER: coriander-lime-espelette, or truffle and herb.\n\nEach main dish could be enhanced with the addition of : lobster tail, pan seared foie gras, shaved black truffle, or Alaskan king crab.\n\nThe food, drinks, service and views blew us all away. Cannot wait to return ASAP to get another fix of their mine meals and that KOBE!!!",

The trails all throughout are awesome for running and I love all the bridges and ponds. I ran through a little natural habitat today I'd never seen and realized how huge this park is (and how diverse!)\n \n I love what is encompassed here as well: The Muny, the (free!) Zoo, the Boathouse (paddle boating!), the History & Art museums (and Art Hill!), etc...it's amazing how they've created such an \"escape from the city\" right in the heart of it all. \n   \n It's incredibly well kept and is patrolled frequently--I never feel like I'm unsafe or unprotected, even when I go alone. It's the perfect place to go play a friendly game of football, attempt rollerblading (don't do it down the history museum hill, you'll have battle wounds--trust me), go for Twilight Tuesdays, or a cool event like Shakespeare in the Park that just wrapped up--there's Always something unique and fun to do here!",

  "text": "Trish found a Groupon for this place so we decided to give it a try. Located in a small strip mall, the interior was average and clean with about 15 or so tables. Fusion restaurants are kind of a gamble, with trying to cook several types of cuisine, inevitably some come out better than others. This was in fact our experience here as well. \n\nOur specialty roll( can't recall name) was very good, it was a pimped out  shrimp tempura but with avo and spicy tuna added to the top. In hindsight we should have just stuck with sushi. But Trish craved Udon, and I some Mu Shu. We both selected chicken as the protein and both regretted it. While the rest of our dishes were average, the meat was below that. Funky texture and taste and detracted from the overall taste. I like my Mu Shu with pepper oil, and this one was excellent, pancakes however were a bit stale and did not roll very well. \n\nOur servers were friendly and funny, and for the savings( $15 for $30 worth of food) we might return for an all sushi feast.",

  "text": "Nada hit the spot for a fantastic Saturday brunch on a recent visit to Indianapolis. \n\nAlthough staying in the trendy Fletcher Place neighborhood, my friend and I found that the brunch spots in that area proved to be painfully overrun on a Saturday morning. After searching the Yelp app for \"brunch\", Nada popped up as a top pick. It was a short trip to downtown, and we found ourselves in the hippest brunch spot imaginable. \n\nNada has a vibe that's a mesh of swanky Latin American restaurant, cozy lounge, and trendy bar, all wrapped into one. We were able to be seated immediately and started out the meal with a coffee. Even black, it had all the right flavor and smoothness to be satisfying. \n\nFor brunch, we both decided on the Eggs Benedicto; it's the Eggs Eenedict that you know and love but with a little Latin flare as well. Flaky crab instead of Canadian Bacon, and Hollandaise sauce that has just the right amount of picante added to it. After questioning the server I learned that it's thanks to just a touch of sriracha. Duly noted, and my own adventures in attempting to replicate it can begin soon!  \n\nSpeaking of the server, despite the place filling up throughout our meal, he was just the right amount of attentive while we ate. He never lost his upbeat attitude even with the frenzy of high school cheerleaders that filled the place up (apparently they were in town for a convention and all decided to eat at Nada). \n\nI hope that I'll be back soon to experience another meal at Nada, but in the meantime it's one spot that you don't want to miss for a perfect weekend brunch!",

  "text": "When I saw that Ritz East was a Landmark theater I knew I was in good hands. I've been a huge fan of their Tivoli and Plaza Frontenac locations in St. Louis for years, so I know they are pretty much synonymous with quality independent and foreign films in a nice atmosphere. \n\nAs far as I know they are the only theater showing Moonrise Kingdom anywhere in the city, which is a major plus. The ticket prices, too, are extremely reasonable for the location--$9.50 for Saturday evening shows, $6.50 for shows on Wednesdays, and $7.25 for matinees are pretty stellar prices if you ask me. \n\nMy only advice, which is less of a downside and more of a peak-time reality, is to show up a bit early on weekends. When we went for our 8:45 p.m. show yesterday (Saturday) the theater did get very crowded, and a sign posted said that the 7:45 p.m. show had actually sold out. We ended up buying our tickets about half an hour early and walking around for a bit beforehand, which worked out really well because when we came back the ticket line had gotten really long and the theater was starting to fill up. So, be prepared to come early if you want your pick of seats.",

On my last visit, my friends and I really enjoyed the empanadas & the mussels, and thought that the ceviche & the tamale were just O.K.

This place was a godsend. \n\nWe started with the staple mexican app - guac. Like most people do when dining at Mexican, I ate about a days worth of calories in chips, salsa and guacamole. Totally worth it! The guac had thinner consistency but was still tasty. \n\nI couldn't make a decision on my entree and then I saw a picture of the Molcajete on the menu and convinced my husband we had to order it. Pictures get me every time! This magnificent dish is plenty to share for 2 people. It comes with literally everything you could want - chorizo, chicken, steak, shrimp, veggies, rice, beans and tortillas. It is served in one of those hot pot lava dishes and it will be insanely hot so do not touch it! Every bite was absolutely amazing but the chorizo and shrimp were my fave. It was the perfect way to get a little of everything. Can't wait to come back here!",

  "text": "I was pretty pumped when I saw a Dunkin' Donuts being built on 5th street. Granted, I usually take 370 to get to work, not 70, but I figured I'd take a brief detour once every so often to grab me some donuts and iced coffee. (Plus they finally reopened the 70 bridge..fuck yeah, MoDOT!)\n\nI went on the grand opening day....(oddly enough, I had a dream before it opened that I went there on the grand opening and there was a gigantic tray of donuts in the middle of the store and people could eat as much as they wanted--wtflol)....and it was CROWDED as balls. Not surprised though! They had people dressed up as gigantic donut and gigantic coffee which was pretty silly..can't help myself not to honk at 'em when I drive past. And also funny b/c the McDonald's across the street felt the urge to 'compete' or more like join in on the ridiculousness that is people in giant food costumes in the hottest month of the summer, lol.\n\nClearly they have some kinks to work out. Lots of fresh employees who have clearly never worked in fast food before (is this considered fast food? I guess if you consider starbucks fast food, then yeah?) and lots of newbie mistakes made but hey that's okay. I didn't mind that they spilled someone's iced coffee all the hell over dodge....I was just glad I wasn't the first person in line when it happened...that person got a little bit splattered, lol. They worked really hard to clean it up, though, and were cheerful about it, not angry.\n\nThe people who work here are SUPER nice and super excited which is refreshing but I can't help but wonder how long that will last, lol. They have little pieces of paper with all the donuts on them (sans seasonal I think) which makes it way easier to order when you're getting a dozen for your coworkers...I wish other places had thought of that sooner! Plus you can take those back to your office and maybe survey which kinds ppl like so no donuts get wasted on your next order. ;) \n\nThe only downside so far is that the iced coffee is never consistent. The first time I got it, I couldn't decide if I wanted cream and sugar or not b/c I'd actually never had one before and I was worried it would be too sweet so they did half for me and it was close-ish to being just right for my tastes, but the second time I asked for full cream and sugar and it was too creamy and not sugary enough....maybe I am just a n00b to DD myself, but I don't get why they don't just let people put their own in like at starbucks? Maybe they did have some but I didn't see it. IDK. I'd probably go back when I am not running late to work and have more time and figure out the correct proportions to suit my tastes for future reference.\n\nAnyway! I haven't tried their breakfast food yet but I suspect it's deliciously greasy and amazingly bad for me yet tasty. DD is a BFD here apparently b/c there used to only be just the two in the airport but I heard the dude who owns those (Indian guy, I think? and his fam?) opted to open more DD's up, so there should be at least one or two more coming to the area....St. Peter's, mebbe?\n\nGo get yo sugar fix!",

Street parking was all full but there is a lot behind the restaurant designated for the shops and restaurants that Verde belongs to.\nThis was one of the most \"bang for your bucks\" places on the devour menu this winter - for $30 a person I was able to get their queso fundido, an order of quesadillas with rice and salad on the side, a full size margarita, and churros with dipping sauces. I definitely was not able to finish neither my drink nor my dessert but I thoroughly enjoyed the app and entrée. I think the portions are big enough that even on the regular menu I would be satisfied with an entrée for the price. I definitely want to come back for more of their entrees - they have a pretty hefty menu! They also have 2 other locations in Fishers and Ironworks for those who can't make it to Carmel!",

Thus my reason for normally omitting the buns.  \n\nTo be fair, whenever I am visiting a restaurant for the first time, I always give the buns a try to determine what category the bread falls into for next time; pass or stay.  \n\nRockfire Grill, you won my bread discriminating heart with your soft savory flatbread!  After having the pleasure of consuming my meal, I wondered, why aren't more places using flatbread?!  My feeling is that before long, more places will....if they like seeing extra $$$ flowing into their registers.\n\nAs I mentioned before, what's on the outside matters little if what's on the inside is repulsive, but I can happily report that we are looking at an evenly attractive and juicy burger no matter which angle you take.  Great roasted veggies, unique sauces, juicy meat, and soft and savory flatbread.  Fries are crispy and every table is set with 4 squeeze bottles of sauces.  \n\nI'm coming back for you Rockfire, and next time I'm going after the pizzas!",

  "text": "UPDATED REVIEW:\n\nI have been on again, off again on this diet (I follow it loosely when I don't eat their prepackaged meals). I was doing the auto delivery plans after purchasing gift cards from Costco where you get $100 worth of food for $60 which is a bargain. Yes, you supplement the breakfast,lunch, and dinner with additional items like vegetables, eggs, dairy, etc which I figured and didn't mind. The snacks were actually good value compared to individually packaged things from the grocery store. \n\nMy problem is that they are dishonest in their advertising and deliberately omit information that they should legally have to list. \n\nI got an email earlier tonight that there was a 50% off sale on all a la carte entrees due to President's Day. No mention in the ad regarding when it expires. Their website listed the ad as well and likewise, no mention on when the promo ends (this might not sound like a big deal to most people but when you are in California, the time difference can make the difference in getting a promo or not getting a promo). Right when I selected my entrees, the promo changed to just getting free shipping!!! I couldn't believe it. Anytime I have seen promos like this for different companies they list the date and time that things expire. Not South Beach. \n\nI canceled my auto delivery and have like $250 left over in gift cards. If South Beach doesn't try to make this right (I messaged them about this), they lost me as a customer and I will just sell my gift cards on Ebay or Craigslist. In any case the diet itself is easy enough to recreate doing yourself (it was convenient for me, but the pissed me off to the point where I'm done). Want to do your own South Beach without dealing with them? Here you go:\n\nBreakfast- 2 eggs with veggies and a little cheese\n\nSnack- Low carb/low sugar protein shake (I like Atkins and I get the ready made shakes off Amazon for a good price)\n\nLunch- small garden salad and a protein bar or shake (usually I do a Think Thin bar which I can often get for $1 on sale at Ralphs)\n\nSnack- plain lowfat Greek yogurt with a little fruit\n\nDinner- tuna salad with a few whole grain crackers\n\nSnack-Cucumber slices and pistachio nuts\n\nThe only silver lining from this was that it was convenient, I never felt like I was starving, and (the main one), they give you a little purse size book which you keep track of your exercise and what you ate for the day (I ever did this), but the listed about serving sizes and recommended ways to eat when you don't order their food. \n\nIt's a shame that that the cons with this company were really bad as this could have easily been a lot better. If you see gift cards on Ebay and you think it's me, ask for the Yelp Special LOL.",

  "text": "--- HAPPY HOUR EXPERIENCE ----\nFirst of all, this place has a solid happy hour menu and prices. $5-6 drinks and their appetizers are at $7- not bad for a steak place. \n\nThe hostess who sat us down was kind of rude and wasn't super welcoming but we dismissed it because we really wanted to try the happy hour. \n\nFriend and I ordered: Kobe beef sliders, spicy crab and artichoke dip, and potato skins plus blueberry lemon drop and blood orange margarita for drinks. \n\nKobe beef sliders: ok they only gave two sliders but it was DELICIOUS. Perfectly grilled. No complaints. 5/5\n\nSpicy crab and artichoke dip: I'm happy to find out it wasn't drenched in cheese but it wasn't spicy enough. It was okay...overall. The real winner were the pita chips of this dish. 3/5\n\nPotato skins: 4 pieces, it was good and crispy but not my thing. 3/5\n\nThe drinks were a bit sweet but very good. Luckily our service improved when we met our actual waitress. She was awesome. I had to take a few stars off for the unwelcoming atmosphere and a few mediocre appetizers. \n\nI will be back to eat all of the Kobe beef tho.",

  "text": "Cavan is a new addition to the Magazine restaurant scene and after hearing raves, I couldn't wait to try it.\n\nWe made reservations a few days before and we were only able to get in at 9:30, so make your reservations early. When we arrived we were immediately seated at a lovely table in the downstairs area. The restaurant is in a house that has been renovated and I like that it still has the feel of being in an old house. You sit in lovely chairs with an antique feel and there are even a couple of sofas with tables where you can eat. The upholstery is a rich red and the decor of the rest of the space makes for a romantic feel.\n\nAs for the food, we started with the fried oysters and the raw oysters. The fried oysters came lightly fried on a nice toast. They had a lot of flavor and I enjoyed them. The raw oysters were amazing. I don't know what it is, but these are the most unique raw oysters I have ever had. They weren't as salty or big as some other oysters I've had, but they were extremely juicy and the cocktail sauce they were served with complimented them perfectly.\n\nFor my entree, I had the seared gulf fish that came with shaved fennel and white bean salad. The portion was nice and the fish was perfectly cooked, but not so much that it lost the flavor. It was a little cool in the middle, which I liked. The white bean salad was served cold and provided a crisp balance to the entire dish.\n\nFor dessert we decided to get a couple of Irish coffees, which was some of the best Irish coffee I have ever had in my life. It was real Irish coffee and not some overly sweet concoction that some bars might serve. It was a great end to the meal.\n\nI loved my experience here and I would absolutely return. The wait staff was attentive and kept our drinks poured and made sure that we had everything that we needed and that we were satisfied.",

  "text": "I fell for the hype. I'm a big fan of unusual ice cream flavors, and this place advertised tons of them, so on our trip to NOLa, after eating at Commanders, we made the short extra trolley trek out here to try this ice cream, which I thought would be just as impressive as all the various other amazing ice cream shops I've been to. It was... decent ice cream. Pretty good, even. I'd give it 4 stars instead of 3 because it's pretty cheap - but I could also tell the difference in quality between a place like this, and a place that can get away with charging 5 bucks for a cup instead of 3. And they didn't have that many exotic flavors when I was there, either. I don't even remember which flavors I ended up getting, and it's only been a couple weeks. Granted, it's been a *crazy* couple weeks, but still.",

I am a HUGE fan of all things hot chicken, fried chicken, chicken tenders, etc. and this place did not disappoint. \n\nI got the jumbo tenders (3 large tenders on top of a piece of toast and topped with a pickle) and a side of the mac & cheese and Parmesan fries. I highly recommend this meal if you're unsure what to try! The fries are a very generous portion and they go great with the hot honey dipping sauce. My fiancé got the chicken sandwich with the mashed potatoes which were also very good! \n\nAs far as spice level, we both tried the \"Tweener\" which was a 4/6 on the spice chart. This was a great choice if you like hot, but don't like runny nose/crying hot. We both think we could probably handle the \"hot\" which is the next level up next time we go.",

  "text": "I love going to Fresh Thyme! \nTheir loss leader buys on meat and produce on the front of the circular can't be beat! Excellent buy on all natural chicken breasts, raw shrimp and sausage! When they have their bacon on sale, BUY IT! They have THE BEST BACON! They have 3 different bacons available at the deli counter- thick cut, applewood and peppered! Buy all 3! I love using the peppered bacon with roasted Brussels sprouts and with appetizers that call for bacon. The pepper gives it a kick. The applewood is phenomenal and the thick cut is perfect or sandwiches. Also don't pass up their sausage when it is on sale for $1.99 per pound. They have a lot of great choices for chicken sausage and pork sausage and if you don't see it, pre-order CHORIZO SAUSAGE HERE! Do not pass it up if you see it in their deli case and if sausage is on sale, request at least a couple pounds of it because it is SO much better than the pre-packed chorizo. Their chorizo is highly seasoned and flavorful, but doesn't cook down with a lot of oil floating in the meat. The pork and chicken chorizo sausage Is good. \n\nThey also have excellent buys in shrimp that are either $4.99 or $5.99 per pound and they are big and deveined and delicious! \n\nAs much as I wish their was a Trader Joe's on this side of the river, fresh thyme has become my health conscious go to store when I am looking for all natural, \"clean\" or organic Products.",

  "text": "Was invited to a seminar sponsored by MSC cruise lines.  Have only been to the Rusty Pelican once years ago for a Mother's Day brunch and hadn't been back since. \n\nThis is located off the Courtney Campbell causeway at the end of Rocky Pt rd. Being right on the bay, this waterfront restaurant has amazing views and is a perfect place for special occasions, corporate events or weddings.   A perfect setting for date nights. \n\nAs we entered the Grand Ballroom, we knew we were in for a great start to a great buffet style meal. With lots of veggie options, I was a happy camper. Not sure if this would be same as their menu offerings, but everything I tried (except the key lime pie) was delicious. Salads and green beans, pasta salad and mashed potatoes as well as mahi mahi were well prepared. No complaints at our table at all. \n\nI grabbed what I thought was cheesecake and it was key lime that was so very tart I couldn't eat it. As there were about 150 people, they had run out of the cheesecake. A very nice server went back to the kitchen and brought me a piece and it was great!  \n\nOnly complaint was the temp of the room. It was freezing. Maybe because they didn't want us to snooze during the one hour long presentation.  It worked! \n\nBeautiful outdoor fireplace helped warm me up before frostbite set in. \n\nWasn't real impressed on that Mother's Day brunch I went to but will def check this place out again in the near future.",

I had a subpar experience here over a year ago. The food this time erased that experience. I was really amazed at how well prepared the food was. I took someone here who'd never had Indian food and she really enjoyed it. The resturant is very large and almost reminds me of an event hall/ older cruise ship. It's nice, I don't mind going here every so often. \n\nOne tragic flaw.......there was a speck of lipstick on my drinking glass and the water pitcher glass was foggy so I dined without drinking anything.",

  "text": "While waiting for the \"Book of Mormon\" lottery the past few days we have been watching them put the finishing touches on this new burger joint. R told me it was open and I was craving a burger so off we went. \n\nWe ordered fries and rings. The onion rings were delicious, but the fries were mushy and not crisp or crunchy. The sauces and the ketchup weren't our cup of tea. The smoke sauce is best, but smuggle in your own Heinz. I also think it's sort of weird that they don't have a soda fountain or gun. It's all bottled soda. With fries/burgers I always want something carbonated and generally a troth of it. I am American after all! So, the burgers come. The buns are bigger than the burger. The buns have these weird seeds on them. Flax? Uncertain. My beef burger doesn't even taste like ground beef. The texture is bizarre. I ate half. I just didn't feel like complaining or I would have. The pickles however are delicious! I had a side of sweet pickles and dill pickles on my burger. The stout onions were good as well. \n\nR had the bean burger and said it had no taste or seasonings. The guac on it she said tasted heavily of raw onion. She was not impressed. She also ordered a vanilla milkshake, but said it was lackluster. \n\nOur bill was 44! Ridiculous we didn't even have cocktails or a dessert. Definitely not returning and hope you will get your burger on elsewhere!",

  "text": "I finally made out to Black Thorn Pub with some friends for dinner on a Friday night. I was so excited to finally make it out and try Black Thorns famous Chicago style pizza. For some reason I pictured some old pub but this place is a total dive bar right in the middle of a neighborhood. Even though it's not what I expected, it's still fun and unique. \n\nThey have really cheap beer including a small craft selection from Schlafly.  If you want to eat dinner, you need to get here about an hour to an hour and a half before you want to eat. That's how long it takes to cook your pizza...I was aware of the wait but for some reason I thought it would be more like 45 minutes...not double that (it might be shorter if you are the first pizza order in). The other thing to note is seating....\n\nSince this is pretty much a dive bar seating is a free for all. You have to be fairly aggressive with getting a seat. I had to wait about 30-45 minutes before we could get a table and it really wasn't that packed. Between the slow cooked pizzas and limited spots, it can take a while. You can put your order in before you get a seat which is nice. \n\nThe pizza was good but I think I liked it more because I was STARVING and 2 beers deep. The sauce is limited and kind of spicy. My understanding is that there are two kinds of Chicago style pizza, one cheese heavy and one sauce heavy. This one falls under the cheese heavy category. \n\nTwo pieces will fill you up and three will make you feel like you are going to explode. Of course I made the mistake of eating three...no regrets.\n\nI don't know if I'll be back to Black Thorn anytime soon but it was a fun experience! If I lived within walking distance it would be a fun place to hit up every now and again. \n\nRemember...arrive early!",

A little more pricey than other lunch options, but not off the charts by any stretch of the imagination.  \n\nI had the soup special--shrimp bisque--and MAN ALIVE was it good!  So it was not the low-fat option I went in saying I was going to get, but it was completely worth it.  If they have a bisque at all--lobster, shrimp, or otherwise--please try it if you like that sort of thing.  You won't be disappointed!  I also had the portabello mushroom burger.  Didn't really eat the bread (but it was on French bread--different and good) but the mushroom was tasty and was topped with feta and roasted red peppers.  All delish.  \n\nService here is great.  They are just attentive enough--I always had a fresh Diet Coke (add a star for that!) but the waiters aren't annoying either.  Dinner here is equally good, and they have a great wine list.  It's hard not to leave here totally stuffed though--so make sure you have time for an afternoon nap in your cubicle, or after-dinner lounging on the couch.  You'll need it!  Fat and happy...",

  "text": "I did advise the waitress of my gluten allergy and she gave me what appeared to be a makeshift gluten free menu exclaiming half of the stuff on it is no longer being offered so I have to pick what I want and she will tell me if they still make it. I went for a very simple option grilled catfish- no fries. It came out with fries. I had to explain that the fries cant be removed and just give back the catfish as she wanted to do because the catfish was already in contact with the fries which were not gluten free. She said she understood and would have it remade completely. She came back with the \"new plate\" and unbenounced to her I have a gluten tester and the food tested positive for gluten up to 20 parts per million. She said she didn't know why. The manager came and she also didn't know why and said its just grilled and seasoned. I did ask what seasoning they use (Tony's) and that does contain wheat which they were unaware that seasonings could contain wheat. My hubs tasted a piece of the Catfish and he said it was great (it looked great), but I couldn't eat it. We had the chargrilled oysters which were great and that was it for me. They couldn't guarantee anything except salad was gluten free so I passed and ate dinner at another restaurant. My husband had the crab Ceasar which he said was alright, nothing to write home about. The restaurant is kind of dark, dated and old looking. The furniture looks worn and frayed. I honestly was shocked this was a hotel restaurant for how run down it looked and for the nice area it was in. I skipped drinks also because I could see them making drinks in the kitchen bar area and it did not look clean at all. There was junk piled up everywhere. We left spending very little $$$ and I was glad.",

I came with a coworker after work and we were seated next to the window that overlooked the bay. It was really cool to see so many pelicans diving into the water and catching fish (hence the name of the restaurant) and we even saw a dolphin! \n\nThe food and service however, was not what was expected. We started with the blackened scallops ($15). I was horrified when they were brought out to us (see the picture). The dish was a complete mess. The scallops were butchered; all different sizes, cut unevenly. They were WAY too seasoned and over cooked. Scallops are supposed to be refreshing and succulent; but not these poor fellas. Also the presentation with the sauces looked like slop & runny grease. I'm not sure how this dish made it past the kitchen and serving crew to our table without being questioned. \n\nFor my meal, I got the lemon garlic shrimp risotto ($29). The dish was tasty, a little oily and garlicky, but it was fine. \n\nFor dessert, we ordered the rum coated creme brûlée. This was by far the highlight of the meal. They light it on fire for presentation, which was pretty neat. \n\nI wouldn't recommend to friends, but the restaurant had major hype and potential.... oh well.",

The restaurant itself is very attractive, with a large fireplace, piano, and it sits right on the water.\nOther service was also really good, and our server was prompt and very friendly.\nStick to the seafood here, if you do make a visit. My sis-in-law ordered a fish dish with veggies on the side, and it was really good. I gt my son the lobster risotto appetizer, which did not get eaten. It was pretty salty, and more risotto rice than meat.\n\nHubby and I split the filet mignon with a side of baked potato, and the mashed potatoes. The steak was to be cooked medium, and it came out rare to medium rare. The baked potato was still hard, somewhat uncooked in the middle. Hubby asked server to cook steak to medium, and he took it back. But, it came back well done. Usually, at upscale restaurants, when a sensitive, and small portion of steak such as a filet isnt cooked right, they will cook a fresh steak to compensate, instead of destroying the first piece. They didn't do that here. This pretty much ruined our dinner.\nThe mashed potatoes were ok. Kind of more mushy than mashed. No excuse for crappy food when the restaurant is completely empty. \n\nOur drinks were good, and that's the only reason I would ever return.",

To me, bliss is discovering a jewel in the rough where the service and food is indeed extraordinary for less than $10! I've always wondered but now I understand why Mood Café is rated the best restaurant in the city of Philadelphia.\n\n1. First of all, the food here reflects the owner's philosophies. Made with love and care, the intricate blend of ingredients is truly magical. Each flavor is bright, distinct, and amazing. I cannot recommend a specific lassi or chaat because if you choose from any of the literally hundreds of possible combinations, you will not be disappointed. Although Hassan always says kindly that you can have your money back anytime if you do not approve, no one has ever done so.\n\n2. From the wildly popular rose lassi to the many fruits in the chaats, every single food item on the menu is made fresh from scratch. It makes you wonder if he is actually hiding a huge secret elaborate garden somewhere?! \n\n3. Vegan, lactose-intolerant, and can't eat spicy? No worries fellow patrons. At Mood Café, it's all about you, the valuable customer. And amazingly, it doesn't matter what you prefer, because you'll find out it all will taste oh so delicious!\n\n4. Hassan personifies what all business owners should strive to become: friendly, accommodating, down to earth, and funny. When you leave Mood Café, you'll have both your stomach and heart content with incredible food and genuine love. \n\nI honestly wish Mood Cafe was more common in the world. People like Hassan working hard to make the best food with the best service possible, not the cash that comes with it. Simplicity and perfection at every level. Bravo!",

  "text": "Like a nice casual summer fling with that sorta cute girl that's visiting your neighbor for a weekend... and goes away forever, leaving behind an 'ok' memory, but nothing to really brag about.\n\nNice, pub-ish type of atmosphere, with tons of \"Endless Summer\" memorabilia from the movie, which I remember from yesteryear, back from my college days in the late 80's, so it's hanging on to a relic theme of the past. \n\nService was friendly enough, so I didn't mind visiting with family. The food though, was so-so. The halibut tacos was a WINNAH! Awesome, succulent, like the best kiss you've had in a long time.\n\nThe caesar salad was 'meh', something you'll find comparable to a highschool cafeteria... so skip it.\n\nClam chowder is advertised as the 'best in Santa Barbara', but came up short to this Bostonian. Was like clam-flavored cream, and mom HATED it.\n\nFish and chips was ok. My son, who isn't the greatest fan of fish that isn't fish fingers, actually ate the whole thing. That's a plus for any of you out there with kids that are picky eaters.\n\nFried calamari was blah. I've been in tons of dive pubs that serve better calamari than this.\n\nNow, I did try the oyster shooter, which I normally dig at sushi places. This place had an interesting take on it, and I will admit I liked it. Doesn't have the sushi-ponzu flavor I'm used to in LA, but has a nice radish-cocktail sauce kick to it, and I will definately order it again if I ever stop by this place again..... but sadly.... I don't think that will happen of my own choice.",

  "text": "I recently attended a work Christmas luncheon at Cocoa's, and it was pretty good! Even a little better than my previous brunch there with my girlfriends once.\n\nThey had a private eating area for corporate parties, sectioned off from the main dining lounge, with enough space for about four large tables. The buffet was located in the hall right inside the entrance. I was very impressed with the service, as the staff greeted us as we arrived and showed us to our tables. They were on top of things throughout the lunch, filling empty water glasses, clearing away empty plates, and asking people if they wanted more coffee. Excellent service!\n\nThe buffet consisted of a table of warm comfort foods, another of salads and fruits, and another of all desserts. The red snapper in sun-dried tomato sauce was my favorite! Simply delicious -- soft and moist, and popping with tart flavor from the sauce. I wanted more, but was saving myself for dessert!\n\nThey had several kinds of cheesecake and mousse cakes for dessert. I decided to go for the yummy-looking raspberry mousse cake, and did not regret it at all. Sweet and creamy, the cake has an outer layer of raspberry gel while the inside is all mousse. Mmm ...\n\nNeedless to say, I was stuffed by the end of the lunch. Cocoa's is not only great for a weekend brunch with your friends, but a corporate outing too!",

Friendly service and they greet you when you walk in, helpful at the counter, and (mostly) clean ... lets face it, since you don't dispose of your own trash anymore, sometimes there are cluttered tables.\n\nThe food is good. Consistent with other Boston Markets. I'm a creature of habit here and normally get the 3 piece dark meal with creamer spinach and corn. However, sometimes I'll get wild and crazy and go with a Carver Sandwich and sweet potatoes.  I'm seriously too wild for words. Lol\n\nMy daughter could eat their Macaroni and Cheese for the rest of her life. Seriously. Every meal. And I've tasted it before ... cheese, al dente, spiral noodles. It's the stuff kid dreams are made of!",

  "text": "It is rare for me to visit a diner, and even rarer for me to say that I'm a fan. But I will acquiesce to Pat's. This spot has been in operation in this same location for at least 70 years. Truly an achievement in this day and age. I have probably only dined here 3 times,today being the most recent. Each time I left satisfied and bewildered as to how the prices can be so low. Today for example, a 3 course lunch was $8 and change, non alcoholic beverage included. Portion size was large, so much so that my senior dining companion took half of his home. We both had different fish dishes, and both were easily worth the cost. It is easy to see how this restaurant makes and keeps loyal customers. My next visit here will probably be for a breakfast, and I am sure that after the meal I will still be a fan.",

The General Tso Chicken was my choice--for $5.50, the lunch special included a generous portion of chicken, laced with crispy chili peppers and a subtle Tso sauce, as well as an egg roll and delicious fried rice. \nThe lunch portion was so large, I had leftovers! The staff does not speak English well, but it did not seem to matter...food is made fresh in front of you as you wait...quickly done, and soo yummy!

This Rouse's is surprisingly larger than you would think it was from the outside but still smaller than most other Rouse's locations.  They pack in a lot of items for the space and it is a well stocked grocery for the Quarter.

The first night we had a romantic dinner at the Angel Oak At Bacara restaurant.  The restaurant is modern, inviting and has a chill atmosphere.  We were greeted with smiles even though we had no reservations .... very nice.  We were seated at one of the lovely booths and ordered:\n\n(1)  Drinks\nI ordered my Cosmopolitan which was made perfectly and Hubby had a Dirty Martini.  A great start to our evening.\n\n(2)  Complimentary Bread and Seasoned Butter\nOMG, the bread was house made, warm  and was so delish.   After you add the butter you will find heaven.\n\n(3)  Blue Crab Cake\nPan seared, celery root and apple remoulade, caviar.  I had a taste of Hubby's crab cake which was mostly crab, fresh and perfectly seasoned.\n\n(4)  Pancetta Wrapped Dates\nLamb, pickled cucumber, house made yogurt dip.  The lamb was so tender and served with pancetta made it a perfect appetizer.  Very tasty!\n\n(5)  Roasted Bone Marrow\nBone Marrow with Oxtail marmalade, pistachio gremolata, herbs, grilled sourdough.  OMG, this is a signature dish.  Bone marrow and oxtail meat?  What?  Total genius because it was so rich and full of flavor.  Please order this!\n\n(6)  Lobster Bisque\nSaffron rouille, pumpernickel, lobster.  My bisque had lil chunks of lobster ..... luv that!  It was seasoned well and prepared perfectly.\n\n(7)  Caesar Salad\nPecorino romano, boquerones, radishes, herbs.  Hubby's salad was a lil underwhelming.  He didn't like his lettuce shredded.\n\n(8)  Bone In Ribeye\n18oz., USDA Prime.  I wanted the AAAAA Kobe Certified Steak but they ran out for the night =(.  So, hubby and I decided to share the Ribeye and add a lobster tail.  The Ribeye was perfectly cooked to medium rare and was SO juicy.  The lobster tail was tender and was the perfect match for our steak.\n\n(9)  Lobster and House Made Gnocchi Gratin w/ local lemons\nOur lovely server recommended the Gnocchi to accompany our Ribeye.  OMG, the dish was so DELICIOUS.  The Gnocchi was creamy and the dish was full of lobster pieces.  I could had ordered this dish as my main entree ....... yes, that good!  Order this!\n\n(10)  Candy Bar\nDark chocolate cremeaux, peanut butter crunch, salted caramel ice cream.  If you luv chocolate and a decadent dessert, the Candy Bar is for you.  This dessert will definitely make your palate dance.\n\n(11)  De-Caf Coffee\nThe restaurant's coffee was perfect with my dessert.\n\nI had a romantic dinner with Hubby at the Angel Oak at Bacara.  Their food is delicious and the service was attentive and very friendly.  5 Stars!",

  "text": "I was a Starvin' Marvin! I wanted pizza! I wanted GOOOOOD pizza. Something that I could really sink my teeth into. Deep dish would fit the bill. I've had a hankering to try Rocco's, read all the great reviews, even bookmarked in Yelp.\n\nWell, like Yelp says when you hover over the 2 stars, \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"\n\nWe ordered the Kitchen Sink (pepperoni, sausage, green pepper, mushroom, red onion). To be brief, you get a hefty pizza, they put a lot into it. But it is too much and too rich. Too much cheese. Yes, too much. Too much garlic. And I'm not afraid of garlic. Not enough tomato flavor in the sauce because it was overpowered by the garlic. We were not that enamored with the pizza. One slice will probably do you in. Even so, I'm not anticipating eating the leftovers like I usually do if there's leftover pizza. I'll eat it because I paid (a lot) for it and because it's there, but not because I loved it. First disappointment.\n\nAlso had the chicken wings because of the reviews. The wings are crispy fried. I've had better. These wings are chewy. My favorite part of the wing is the wingette. When they are this crispy fried, you have more of the crispy and less of the meat. The meat is dried out. Very chewy, too. Can't break the wingette apart. They are OK, but not great. Medium was plenty hot. I've had crispy wings where the skin was still thin, but crispy, and you still had plenty of juicy meat. Second disappointment.\n\nI originally ordered the stuffed pizza. I paid for it, but didn't get it. I called them up. After some polite run-around, I spoke to the manager who promptly said he would send the refund in the mail. Not a lot ($2) but we'll see if they are good for their word. I'm sure they are. Third disappointment.\n\nI'll leave on a good note: they had good service. I called it in, they said it would be ready in 35 minutes. I came in at 35 minutes and it was ready.\n\n***Update: The owner called, apologized, sent me my $2 AND a $10 gift certificate to use next time I visit. A truly good business handles missteps well as things will happen. Good job.",

I have so many fond memories of visiting her while she was working behind that bakery counter. That store to this very day is still my favorite one. This location is giving it a run for it's money though.\n\nThis Rouses is super cool! Oh my goodness. I was surprised seeing it in the Quarter and was in awe walking in. It looks tiny but it's not. It's got everything you'd find in your neighborhood Rouses. I love the narrow aisles and the liquor behind the counter. It feels like an old timey drugstore. I love it!\n\nThis would be the perfect place for all the ingredients you need for a fabulous Bloody Mary. Or dinner. :)",

  "text": "Well, I was wavering.  You see, I like diners ... Places where almost any combination of foods especially if fried can end up on a plate in front of you\n\nEvery diner has purchased the same water glasses.  Every diner has a long list of lunch or dinner specials.  And, every diner has food items you can't find at any reputable restaurant like stewed tomatoes and beets just beets.\n\nSo I found myself unexpectedly in front of the Harrison House, a diner whose sign boldly proclaims \"best of\" so like a piece of cheap tin pulled in by a powerful magnet I was seated before I knew it.\n\nLots of choices ... Lots of specials and that all too familiar glassware.\n\nNavy bean soup, a diner staple, was my option choice to go along with a crabcake sandwich with fries and coleslaw.\n\nThe soup did not disappoint.  It tasted like a decent version of diner navy bean.  The beans had a good texture and the broth was flavorful.\n\nBefore I could finish the soup my lunch was delivered.  Fries HOT - Crabcake HOT; coleslaw in a little plastic cup & tartar sauce runny.\n\nThe fries were crisp on the outside and hot fluffiness inside.  My crabcake had a nice crisp exterior and the interior of this overly breaded \"crab\"cake met diner expectations.  Actually an overly breaded crab cake is what diners make; never expect the taste of crab to grab you.  The tartar sauce was surprisingly tasty and the slaw .... Well it was served diner-style in a plastic cup would you really expect a lot from it.\n\nThe diner is clean but it does smell like a diner and if you have eaten in your share of diners you will recognize the scent (Perhaps that's what happens when your kitchen presents such a variety of foods.).\n\nI decided to hang around a little because there was one unique phenomenon at the Harrison House that I picked up on immediately and remained consistent during my entire time in my booth.  All of the employees lips are permanently turned downwards.  Not a single person working here smoked except when greeting a customer (if then) but the smiles vanish when they again contemplate their place of employment.  A no smile reality is not a good sign of what happens behind the scenes\n\nSo if you are in the neighborhood wanting diner food this place is ok but definitely not worth a long trip down the highway.\n\nAnd, why no rice pudding with my special??",

  "text": "This place isn't bad. Since writing a review for a grocery store could take me all day, I will try to summarize:\n\n(1) Decent seafood section, although I will say that only 3 out of the 11 clams I got the other day actually opened up when I cooked them in my stew. Not sure if that was my fault or what... but it made me feel like I wasted my $5. The seafood woman is super sweet though, and she's always willing to help me with my crazy requests.\n\n(2) They do not stock my favorite cereal, or dried cranberries, or my favorite red wine (Cavit Pinot Noir) in a \"normal\" size--they only have a HUGE size so I feel bad buying it because it's like $15 or more and I end up wasting 3/4 of the bottle because no one in my apt drinks except for me and I can't finish a whole bottle alone!\n\n(3) Produce is generally fresh and also decent selection which I appreciate. They usually have a full stock of fresh herbs which is a pretty big deal for me, hehe.\n\n(4) Friendly and knowledgeable employees and staff, always willing to help out be it a cashier, manager, dept worker, or shelf-stock-er.\n\n(5) Location. Right near TJ's, Target, Walmart, and Whole Foods so if I DO need something that this location does not have, chances are the thing(s) I need are only a 5 minute drive away! Also it's right off highway 64/40 so that's convenient too. About an 8 minute or so drive from my apartment if it's not super rush-hour-y.\n\nThat's about it.\n\nOh and PS: If you download the App \"aisle411\" on your phone, you can easily and quickly locate the items on your shopping list!! :D",

If you are a regular, you may have one last time to lineup, and get a seat in their superb and lovely dining room. Sorry, had to do it, as The Farm and Fisherman will be closing its doors very soon. \n\nAfter a long, busy, and stressful night at work, I felt I didn't want to spend another tough occasion home alone (it was  Mother's Day.) I was tired and stressed; all what I needed was s a gift that doesn't need to be wrapped. I booked a lonely table just for one, and I survived my awesome brunch, thanks to Rachel, my awesome waitress. She made my visit very enjoyable. \n\nAs soon as I saw the innovative brunch menu, I was torn between ordering two small plates and a dessert, or one main dish and a desert.

I decided not to contain myself and get one main dish: Chicken Roasted in Hay (brilliant & delicious,) and a dessert ( was something with strawberry & mascarpone whipped cream.)

That said, the Gumbo Shop serves up some of the best gumbo we've had in the city.\n\nWe ordered bowls of Seafood Okra and Chicken Andouille Gumbo.  Both were tasty but the chicken sausage gumbo edged out the seafood gumbo as the better of the two.  The roux was a deep, rich brown and was flavorful without being too salty or too spicy.  There were meat in every spoonful and I thought the ratio of rice to gumbo was perfect.\n\nOur seats in the courtyard were comfortable even if we needed a few more inches of space between our table and our neighbors.  Tim, our server, brought our drinks and food without delay so we were in and out in less than 30 minutes.  We got to the restaurant just after the lunch rush so we didn't have to wait for a table.\n\nWith 1,983 reviews, this one is a drop in the bucket but I wanted to add my voice to the chorus of satisfied diners.",

Not surprisingly, given the size of our group, there was quite a wait for a table.  No problem - we were able to sit outside (it was chilly, but there were heaters) and order drinks while we waited.  Most of us had spiked milkshakes.  YUM!!  I had the bananas foster one and it was fantastic.  I would order it again in a heartbeat.  Only problem was that it was very filling, but that's not really such a problem!\n\nOnce we were seated (at the world's deepest booth) we ordered our burgers.  It was great that everything could be done with a veggie patty, as we had a number of people in our group with dietary restrictions.  My burger and tater tots were super tasty.  Judging by the silence as we ate,  and the table full of clean plates, everyone else seemed to enjoy their food as well.\n\nService was a bit slow, but overall great.  We had the same server outside for our drinks and inside for our meal, which was great.  He offered to do separate checks (which was especially complicated since we had all moved seats), which was much appreciated.\n\nOverall a great experience and I look forward to returning!",

  "text": "#MyLongestReviewToDate\nRoom 315 overlooked the pool, the beach, and the corner edge of the hotel building to the right. The saving grace from the partial view was the nice sized balcony with two chairs and a small plastic table. The room was a king with balcony (pool  and gulf view), but the actual sight line of the pool was blocked by a tree. The shuffle board court was quite visible. If I actually cared to see the pool from the room, this would bother me since it was part of the description for the room. What did bother me in the room was the lack of art (photo of room art posted), very low water pressure for the shower, no light at the table (a small reading lamp would be nice), no bars or hooks in the shower to hang clothes on (not even a retractable clothes line), and only one three drawer short chest of drawers and two night stand for clothes (the chest was slightly taller than the night stands and perfect height for the tv). These are the things that bothered me, yet I gave them 4 stars (before since other things were discovered by the Mister). So, as of checkout, the pros don't necessarily outweigh the cons for me. The concerns that we have cannot be resolved before my check out date and are not one room specific (that has changed since we found a dusty black sports bra under the bed while checking the room to make sure we didn't leave any if our things behind). Cleanliness would cause me to not stay here again.\nI really liked having a full kitchen with electric stove, although I didn't cook (I like having choices). The kitchen was stocked with the basics including dishes, glassware, utensils, towels, coffee maker. We found two unclean knives in the drawer (see photos by Carl O.) Free wi-fi is always good (even if you've unplugged you will need to check into your flight home, or maybe watch something streaming). There is a grocery store about a mile walking west and a Publix close by to the east (go to the Publix, you'll thank me later), John's Pass and Boardwalk is about a mile west and great for all types of entertainment in case you need more than a relaxing time by the beach. There are very good to decent restaurants about a quarter of a mile walk con the resort (great recommendations from the front desk). The lobby is very small, just enough to handle business, including a few seats for waiting so there were no hustle bustle attitude workers (everyone that I encountered was very helpful). There is a rack of pamphlets for local activities and offerings and a shelf of DVD movies and board games (free for hotel guests to check out).\nWe greatly enjoyed the pool. It's my most favorite amenity. The heated pool was clean and ranged from 3 ft 4 in to 8 ft. No life guard on duty. Several tables and chairs with umbrellas, and loners at the pool and just before the beach entry. Clear skies, flying birds...pure serenity.\nFree parking on-site, a great plus compared to other local resorts charging $20 or so daily for parking. Free daily continental breakfast included packets of oatmeal, coffee, cinnamon rolls, fruit, nut bars and 4oz juice cold rounds (the kind you get for middle school lunch). Ok, that's not so impressive but for a quick bite it will do (coffee and a cinnamon roll made the top of the list). \nOverall, this hotel is clean, but the room had some issues as noted, quiet (until I heard a crying kid across the balcony area, called the front desk and was told that the owners family may be visiting with kids - INSERT BLACK STARE #That'sNotAdultsOnly #That'sNotWhatIPaidToSeeOrHear #NowThat'sEnoughToMakeMeNotReturn #IFlewALongWayForAnAdultsExclusiveStay). They can be add cut add they want to be, and it doesn't matter how big they were, they were present, seen, and heard, and apparently live in the penthouse (said someone at the front desk as he showed us the family pictures upon check out). Nevertheless, our stay was slow and quiet. We were able to enjoy the beach and just plain get a mental break from a busy life, which was the goal. \nI should also mention that the hotel does not offer canopied beach chairs for the beach, but rather they are available to rent for $20 a day from a local vendor who has set up this option on the free access beach section that is directly in front of the hotel. You can buy a chair umbrella across the street for under $15, a worthy purchase even if you throw it away after checkout, in case you can't take it on the plane. Technically, you can honestly get more amenities in most other resorts, but we knew that before booking and didn't come here for that. Worth noting again, the heated pool is great and relaxing and it is greatly encouraged daily.\n***Yes, I love children so take this adult face value... an adults exclusive resort should be just that. Since the owners live in the penthouse and have children know that this claim is not ever possible at the Shoreline Island Resort - Adults Exclusive.***\nIJS",

Just another reminder of how wonderful Florida living is. \n\nAdded to it are relatively good servers. They're not insanely nice, but they are attentive and efficient. Even during Spring Break madness, they keep it together. \n\nThis bar also has volleyball courts set up and a few bars to choose from. There's a man that occasionally sets up his amazing BBQ food stand in the parking lot which is always a plus when he appears. \n\nMy only real complaint is the parking. It's a hot damn mess, and half the time, parking in the public lot is your best bet. \n\nBut otherwise, all good.",

We filtered our search on the Yelp app, and Macho Tequilas came up.\n\nThe Place: \nThe restaurant was colorful and full of decorations. They had pinatas hanging from the roof, paintings, and all kind of stuff.\nThey have a bar and table seating. The tables might remind you like your dining table at home. We got a big table just for the two of us.\n\nThe Food:\nThe server brought us chips & salsa and took our drink and food order. I got a Margarita (of course), and my husband had a corona. We got some guacamole for the chips and green and red sauce. The green sauce was SPICY, but I could not stop eating it!\n\nFor lunch, I had the \"Carne Asada\" no tortillas and white rice and husband got a chicken \"Wet Burrito.\"  We were happy with the food. My carne asada was delicious! It tasted really good. I loved the rice and beans. \nThe chicken burrito was enchilada style. The sauces and seasoning were very authentic. We were greatly surprised by the food at this place. We had no idea about it.\n \n\nThe Service:\nA nice lady took good care of us during our visit. She made sure we had enough chips, waters, and drinks. The food came out in promptly and our check too. \n\nYes, I will be coming back. Sometimes, I feel we have so many Mexican places in Reno, but they are all the same. So I am glad to find something a little bit more different finally.",

  "text": "I have driven PAST Blake's in Deming, NM on my way out of Hatch so many times and always thought to myself, \"Huh, I really should try them out.\" But I never do because I just want to get home to Tucson and to be honest, 9 times out of 10 I just put a Sparky's green chile cheeseburger in my belly so I wasn't hungry. When Blake's came to Tucson, I was really excited!!!\n\nDon't believe the hype. The green chile cheeseburger at Blake's is a mediocre burger overall with the saving grace being the green chile. The green chile is delicious but not very hot, at least for my taste but that's not where I find fault with this burger. The actual burger is greasy and just a whatever burger. Mine was thrown together so sloppily that I had more onions and tomatoes off the bun than on it. I literally had to put my burger back together before I could eat it. And then the grease started dripping off my hands. Honestly, I would compare the \"burger\" part of my sandwich to any old fast food place but priced much higher. We also had seasoned fries which were good and onion rings which were not. The size of the order of onion rings for the price was NOT a bargain at all.\n\nSo I'm glad I finally tried Blake's but I really don't think I'll be back. Especially when the green chile double cheeseburger I had at Whataburger was actually better but then again, my judgement on that one may have been clouded by a hangover.",

  "text": "Dropped by here on our one day tour of Philadelphia. I can't say I've had many cheese steaks in my life so no judgements on whether it's the best cheesesteak ever here. \n\nThere's quite a lot going on in their menu - you can get chicken or steak, and they have a good number of sides (all of the deep fried or bacon variety) in case you're extra hungry. They've also got grilled cheese if that's your jam, and some more creative sandwiches - including one that resembles a pizza melt.\n\nThey have five different cheeses that you can choose from - cheez whiz, american, mozzarella, provolone, and bleu, if I remember correctly. Some toppings (fried onions and hot peppers) come free, while others (bacony bacon) cost extra. They have these delicious picked hot peppers in a jar behind the hot sauce. \n\nI got a bacon cheese steak with cheez whiz and it was exactly the sodium, grease explosion I was expecting. The meat is sliced thinly and is quite tender, and the whole deal is absolutely saturated with cheese. The cheez fries are way more filing than they look, and they come with maybe half as much fries as you want given the cheese ratio - you'll most likely end up with globs of leftover cheez whiz unless you like eating that stuff with a spoon. \n\nStaff is friendly but it's mostly self serve after you get your sandwich. Overall, pretty awesome experience, would definitely drop by again if I'm ever in town.",

I had B & G with hash browns and one scrambled egg.

Not inherently bad, but I like a hard scramble and it was still a little too wet for my taste.  The hash browns came out exactly like i like them, and the B&G was delicious as well.  Fluffy biscuits with a sausagy ( I know its not a word, but work with me here) gravy that was delicious.  \n\nIts also important to note that Teen does not like powdered sugar and they dusted her pancakes in it.  What this means is that Husband and I got to eat the top one.  I took a bite just as a curiosity because I was already full...OMG!!! Those pancakes were SO delicious we were on that thing like piranhas on a cow until there was nothing left on the plate.  And that was after they sat for awhile, because they were the last thing she got around to eating.  \n\nEverything here was good, but if you like pancakes they are a must-try!\n\nNo complaints about waiting or service that I saw in some of the other reviews.

Dining al fresco under some shade with fans blowing was a nice retreat from the busy Bourbon St. All that, plus a cup of CAFE AU LAIT ($2.99/sm) and an order of delightful BEIGNETS ($3.99), I felt right with the world. I can't say I'm not a fan.",

  "text": "This bistro recently opened not too long ago  (the building previously housed Kenmac Flowers). The name, Knights Bistro pays homage to the philanthropic Knight's family of Collingswood.\n\nAfter driving by this place a few times, we decided to stop-in. This bistro has its own parking lot (fairly large).  We were very disappointed & had  totally different expectations of this place. The inside decor has a nice bistro feel to it with a casual environment. However, the food was nothing more than a mediocre pizzeria/ sandwich shop with a few entrees thrown into the mix. \n\nWith a bistro concept, we honestly expected to see the likes of Portabella burgers, homemade soups, Pommes Frites, gourmet salads, bison burgers, Charcuterie/Salumi, Roasted eggplant, Hummus platters, etc. on the menu (you get the point)........Instead, they serve your typical Mozzarella sticks, Salads, Pizza, Calzones/Sromboli's, a few pasta dishes, wraps, etc.  blah blah blah.  \n\nI tried the 'Panini Italiano', it was completely flavorless. Each individual ingredient was lackluster. The spinach tasted like it was thawed from a frozen box (they could of at least sauteed  it in maybe some garlic, olive oil, etc.). The chicken was dry. The prosciutto was rubbery. The Foccocia bread wasn't too bad, it had a nice crunch and the inside ingredients were warmed up enough (I hate when places don't cook the panini  under the press long enough). I was then insulted with a small bag of boring Lay's potato chips?  I thought they would of at least served some house made potato chips or skin-on french fries, etc.............   Kate had the Cheese Steak Wrap, it was flavorless..... no amount of ketchup could of saved that wrap. \n\nI would rather pay a few extra dollars more and eat the Panini's at the Kitchen Consigliere Cafe down the street (the difference in quality is like night and day....those panini's are made with love &  come with a small mix green salad AND sweet potato fries). In this day and age, even the bars/taverns are kickin' out some gourmet'ish food, you have to step up to the plate. \n\nOn a positive note, the restaurant server was nice/friendly/proficient. \n\nOn the way out the door, I noticed a pizza tomato pie that looked good. I don't know. Maybe other people will have a differing opinion of this place. I'll try to check back on this site for new Yelp reviews to see what others think, I am curious......  scratching my head about this one. This place has potential.... I think.",

I had a lot of food and I eat it all too, the baby made me do it . I can't say that now unfortunately. \n\nI had doughnuts holes, a shake, a burger with tots and yes, me and the baby ate it all. I wouldn't pay the extra money again for the upgrade Parmesan truffle aioli, it's not really that flavorful and the cheese doesn't melt so it's hard to eat.\n\nThe atmosphere it's cool and the service we had was good. The price range is average high so I'm not too crazy about the place to say I will come often so it wouldn't be my 1st choice if I want a burger. I've been in cheaper places with awesome burgers and when you ask to load the tots or fries they mean loaded. \n\nDefinitely go check them out if you're in the area.",

  "text": "I ate my first 5 Guys burger in Columbia SC several years ago during a visit to Daughter #1 who was in college at USC. Five guys is the rage, Dad. We have to go. So go we did. It was the rage for a reason. I really loved the burgers, the peanuts, and the vibe which was pretty cool for a fast food place. I googled 5 guys when I returned home and loved the story of a Dad and his 4 sons opening up a burger place. And the rest is history. \n\nSo I was super excited when I read that 5 Guys was coming to NOLA. An educated guess is they were in tune with the recent NOLA burger craze and decided to cash in. So D #1, who has since returned to her beloved New Orleans, and I headed to the concreteness that is Clearview Pkwy for a nostalgia burger. \n\nThey did a good job of getting the restaurant to have the same feel as the ones in SC. It was packed at lunchtime on a Tuesday, but the bustle didn't bother me for some reason. I consider the burgers to be the best of the fast food class, pretty close in flavor and texture to Camellia Grill. The fries can stand up to some of the best in NOLA no doubt. One disappointment was the amount of fries per order. In SC I remember ordering a medium fry and getting enough for a family of 4. These orders are tiny and rather pricey. Overall cost is more than your typical fast food jernt but well worth the extra 3 bucks or so for a lunch for two.",

  "text": "My friend Steve is a funny dude. I had offered to drive he and his wife to the airport from Malvern last year. A few days before he sent me a Facebook post that said,\n \" I'm thinking around 9am for our Taco run\"\n\nI replied that maybe 9am was a little early for Mexican food but I'm not one to pass up a Taco run. He soon answered back with a mea culpa that autocorrect changed \" Taxi\" to \"Taco\" and we gad a good laugh about it. I mean, how often is the guy typing \"taco\"?!\n\nAfter successfully getting him to the airport, Steve cleverly rewarded me with a gift card to Chipolte. Thoughtful and funny but I couldn't for he life of me think of one near me or my work. \n\n\" We'll there's one right near me\" offered Steve \n\nThat's great , buddy, but Malvern is about 45 minutes away. No taco is that good!\n\nLuckily, I discovered that this one in Havertown had just opened. Still not totally convenient but near enough. The gift card was for $30, which came out to 3 visits. \nHere is what I learned in these 3 experiences.\n\nIt's a huge parking lot, but I've yet to be able to park anywhere nearby. Pretty much all of Havertown that isn't wedged into the Manoa lot is here. I opt to park by Lowes and walk over. It's less stress.\n\nAn order of Tacos is about $7 it's pretty reasonable and you get full from them. I have to say, the steak they use is only slightly better quality than Taco Bell. Pretty much every other bite is chewy and gristly. I'd stick to the pork or chicken. \n\nIn a few cases I would have been happier with 2 tacos. I almost suffered through a third one. I wish there were more options to get more or less than 3. \n \nI could take or leave almost everything here. It's not bad it's just average. They have tabasco at the counter but  Siracha  as an option would be a game changer. I know it's technically Asian and not Mexican but I think most fans would be willing to overlook it.\n\nThe big draw for me here is their guacamole . It's fresh and delicious. I always get the chips and guacamole along with my tacos and now that my gift card is used up, I may just return only for the C&G.\n\nThe place is relatively clean and the staff is always friendly and helpful. I consider my rating a 3.5. Whether you are on a taxi run or a Taco run, Chipolte could always be a valid option.",

It's a pretty simple setup--picnic tables and bales of hay everywhere, and two trucks loaded with taps of Tired Hands' beer.\n\nThe taps were really good. Everything is only available in a 16oz plastic cup, which was kind of disappointing given the different sizes at the brewery. Tap list was excellent, if a little pricey. I saw some dogs the first time I went but now they have a pretty strict \"no puppers\" policy. There's very little food--just some chips and beef jerky. You're free to bring food in.\n\nStaff, as usual, was awesome. No restrictions on tasting beer and they really know their stuff. I loved Zenaissance, and Alien Church is always a winner. \n\nI'd suggest bringing the prices down a buck each and also getting some food trucks to pull up! Regardless, I'll be back for more.",

Started off with some char grilled oysters - very good. The grouper cheek basket was OK - nothing to write home about but the Crab Legs were terrific and char grilled is the way to go! A solid pound and a half that is nicely seasoned and not too greasy with plenty of sweet crab meat. Comes with two sides but with the crab, who cares about the little red potatoes or coleslaw that had too much mayo.\n\nThe other big win at Captain Bill's is definitely the drink specials - $3.50 for red or white sangria and $4.50 for a rum runner - I think that's a good deal! Also $4.99 for a pomegranate martini - let's have a couple to go with the crab legs! Next time you're in Treasure Island, make sure to stop by Captain Bill's for some good seafood and the live music wasn't bad or too loud either. Service was good and accommodating. Parking in the lot can be tricky during busy times but it was late enough that we parked down by the bank that was closed and had a very short walk.",

The interior is really cute...rustic and kind of kitchy. The food is a-okay. Tonight , with our dark chicken order I found the chicken being on the edge of under cooked. I don't want any question of well done-ness when it comes to chicken. Our Mac n cheese was the last of the pan. I should have waited to ask for the fresh batch. I like their shady, outdoor seating. The craft sodas are kind of cool too.",

  "text": "\"Blenders in the Grass\" makes me think of lawnmowers or something of the sort, but having been there, I now think of delicious smoothies! \n\nI had the mocha blend, which was made with non-fat milk, coffee, chocolate, ice milk, and banana! Yummie! It was so smooth and creamy without being overwhelmingly thick or sweet! The banana added a nice touch too. I also tried some of the Red Banana, which was really tasty too. No need to even compare it to Jamba or other places because this is on another level! You can also add supplements to your drink, and they have a wide selection to choose from. Each drink runs about $5, but they're huge! More than enough to split with a friend. :)",

It's really confusing because you have to give your order at one end (not where the cash registers are) and then you have to walk around to the other side and repeat your order to whoever is at the cash register.. the setup is not systematic, it is jumbled and confusing and the employees don't really assist with directing traffic because they expect you to know the process (which i think is unreasonable considering no other cosi i've ever been to is set up in this manner)\n\nIn addition, I was 1 of 2 customers waiting on an order and i watched my hot beverage through to completion and it took FAR too long for me to be serviced. I'm usually relatively patient with this kind of stuff and I would have been in this situation had the employee making my drink 1. known what she was doing and 2. not had three different conversations with other employees in the meantime.\n\nDisappointed and probably won't be returning to this location.",

For my taste the only Oyster dish I'd prefer would be the  Rockerfeller Oysters dish from Bourbon House. but that's not to take anything away from Dragos, that's just a personal preference. I enjoyed the service, waiter was very attentive and offered good suggestions. The shrimp and grits was very good indeed, not the best I've ever had, a place called the fish house in Pensacola takes that award. Still, you can't go wrong with ordering the shrimp and grits here. Also tried the BBQ Shrimp, (at least Drago's version) again, very good dish, not the best. These were not the typical BBQ Shrimp you get at any Brennan's restaurant in NOLA, these had a nice kick to them though. The ambiance topped it off, good for just about any occasion. Glad to finally make the visit.",

I had to side with the \"Overpriced\" group.\n\nI love seafood, and am a little picky, especially when the price starts moving up the scale. Being  a damn good cook myself, I am probably harder to please than a lot of people.\n\nWe walked in the door... and there was no hostess, maitre d', headwaiter, etc... or anyone to greet us or seat us. After a minute or so, a waitress showed up and explained they don't have a hostess on the weekdays. She seemed a little grumpy, but maybe that was just my perception. \n\nShe seated us... and gave us the full alcohol spiel. I explained that my girlfriend is allergic to alcohol, and I don't drink when I am driving. We ordered water... as that really is my preference. She delivered the water... and we ordered some Conch Fritters. We also  ordered the main courses... I chose blackened shrimp with a Caesar salad... GF got the Fish and Chips.\n\nConch Fritters were meh.. crispy outside, but mush inside, and the conch was tough.\n\nBlackened shrimp were the 60 to a pound size, and I got two skewers.. maybe 20 to 24 shrimp. SMALL shrimp! Blackening was mostly cayenne, and it did not have the complexity I expect from good blackening spices. Cajuns blacken with a ton of butter... that did not happen either (maybe trying to be healthy?), and it does add a lot of flavor. Salad was ok... but the dressing was out of a bottle.\n\nGirlfriend said her Fish and Chips was good, but she only ate the fish, only had three of the fries (and she loves fries)... and barely touched the Slaw (and yes, she loves good slaw). So what does that say?\n\nAnd the waitress never did seem very happy to be there either! \n\nI usually tip well... and I think I only did about 18% here.. instead of my usual 20-25%... because if it is that hard to be there, someone needs to look for a different job. \n\nWe did not do dessert...  \n\nMaybe my expectations are too high? If I want Red Lobster, I will go there... and that is what I feel I got (and no, I don't consider Red Lobster to be good seafood!)  lol!\n\nDefinitely overpriced for what they offer.  I guess all the TV's scattered all over the place, and the emphasis on Alcohol should have clued me in... but like I said above.. I had high hopes.",

I finally made it to Cheu after months of hearing about its greatness from my friends. \n\nWent for lunch and even at 1:00 on a weekday, the place was saturated with hungry lunch-goers. If you're not too concerned about where you sit, belly-up to the bar and make friends with the chef. Watch as he effortlessly prepares each dish fresh. Ask him for recommendations and then take him up on it!\n\nTo start, we had the broccoli/pork appetizer. It was solid and now has me wondering how I can re-create it at home (eating more veggies and all). For my entreé I had the cold green curry noodles. Look, I'm not a huge fan of tofu, but I absolutely loved this dish. Perfect for a humid day when the thought of hot broth makes your mouth sweat.\n\nThe chef/bartender gave us some corn rangoons to test and they were somewhat spicy and definitely something I would order with a round of drinks at happy hour (which they have, M-F 5-6:30).\n\nI've heard dinner can be super packed, so make reservations if you're a party of 4 or less and decide to hit up the joint on a weeknight between 5-6; otherwise, just waltz in.",

Just wish there was more broth in the dumplings!\n\n2) Beef scallion pancakes - $5.99 as of 7/2019. \nAlso a hit.

Highly recommended.\n\n3) Garlic watercress - $12.99 as of 7/2019.  Whenever I eat at a Taiwanese restaurant I make it a point to get this as it's delightfully crunchy and light in flavor.  A must have for vegetable lovers.\n\n4) Szechuan Style Tofu (aka Mapo tofu) - $12.99.\nHoly balls this was spicy.  Most of the mapo tofu i've had has been fairly mild but let me tell you that they should really emphasize the Szechuan text as it has the classic numbing spice that ma la dishes have.  If you like tofu AND spice then look no further than this!\n\nOverall the food was good though service could be better (took a while to clear away dishes).\n\nIf you're in the area and have the same cravings I did then check this place out!",

  "text": "My family was visiting from out of town and wanted to go to an upscale seafood restaurant for dinner, so we chose Rusty Pelican. The environment here is very cozy with all the wood and the fireplaces. The view absolutely cannot be beat. We sat at a table by the water and we were literally \"on the water\" meaning we looked over the edge of our table and could see the bay below us. Now THAT's what I call \"Florida Dining\". Even though the weather wasn't too spectacular it was still very enjoyable and i imagine it's even nicer on a clear day or an early morning. \n\nWe arrived around 6 PM and it was fairly empty in the restaurant, so our waitress was able to greet us promptly. We are serious eaters, especially when it comes to seafood, so we started off with ordering about half of the appetizer menu. We got the seafood ceviche, oysters rockefeller, oysters on the shell, escargot and seafood risotte. Everything was really tasty, but my favorites were the escargot (which I was surprised to have found it sooo tasty) and the seafood risotte. The raw oysters on the shell were also extremely fresh and tasty, some of the best I've ever had. After that, our server made the mistake of asking if we wanted to order entrees or if we were just having apps. HA! Clearly she did not see us coming. Of course we were not done. \n\nNext we all ordered up our dinners. I chose the stuffed gulf grouper with mashed potatoes. My family got the tuna tartare, grouper and cioppino exquisite. We were all very satisfied with our meal. I thought mine was very fresh as far as the grouper goes and the mashed potatoes were just alright. My only complaint in regards to the menu is it was a bit limited in my opinion. For example, it seemed to be lacking key items like crab legs. I would have killed to see crab legs on the menu last night! Also would be nice if they had a few more raw bar options for those who are there for the seafood more than the steak. However everything was good overall. \n\nFinally, we finished up with key lime pie and coffee for dessert and our server continued to check up on us throughout our whole experience. Even though we were there for over 3 hours, she did not make us feel rushed or unwelcomed. I have heard great things about the brunch here and now that i have experienced their dinner, I would likely return for brunch on a special occasion. Definitely worth checking out rusty pelican if you are looking for an upscale experience in a seafood and steak restaurant with a view.",

It was delicious, as well as filling since the portion was huge. One person in our group ordered an omelet and we were all surprised by how small it was. Maybe 1 1/12 eggs? He said the flavor was decent but it was definitely not filling. My cafe mocha was perfect and not overly sweet. It also gave me that caffeine I so desperately needed and got me up and running for the day ahead. \n\nThis location has a big courtyard area with additional seating (and restrooms) upstairs.

  "text": "What has and F and a Z in it and takes you back to a simpler time?  Frank Zappa comes to mind.  In this case, I'm talking about Fazoli's.  I had every intention of eating Vegan here (which they do have options), but \"The Closer I Got\" to the restaurant, that idea faded.  After a crazy stressful month and skipping breakfast to get out the door, I caved and went all out!\n\nI was perusing the menu for a few minutes when the nice cashier girl suggested the sampler which I could get baked.  I think I said \"Yes\" before she could finish the sentence.  The sampler was a mix of their fettuccini alfredo, spaghetti and meatball (singular), and lasagna which also comes with unlimited breadsticks.  After a long drive, I opted to make it a meal so I added a drink and a slice of pizza.  Gotta love that option for a combo!\n\nFor a fast-casual Italian joint, it's surprisingly delicious.  And at 2:30p on a Sunday afternoon, it was like Sunday Supper in Little Italy with a mix of patrons cramming carbs into their bodies like.  I tackled the Fettuccini first and the sauce was creamy and the noodles were al dente.  Then onto the spaghetti where the sauce was flavorful and I made sure I mopped it up with a garlicky breadstick.  The meatball was good, not fall apart tender like a hand crafted meatball, but a firm texture.  The lasagna was done exactly how I like it with an ample amount of ricotta and meat sauce.  It held together when cutting and was delicious.  \n\n\"A cow don't make ham\" as they say, but a cow does make the beefy goodness that helped flavor their options.  The breadsticks that I cleaned my plate with were light and airy.  They gave me 2 to start and when I went back for a refill, they loaded 4 on my plate.  I didn't plan on eating them all but eating a fresh one was like a savory fresh warm Krispy Kreme in texture and just went down so smoothly.  I knew I'd regret it later, but I was living in the moment.\n\nI'm glad there aren't more of these around as I'd be tempted to visit much more often.  This location between Tampa and Orlando is a must stop for any fast food junkie or anyone who likes Pasta dishes.",

Everything was a hard OK... it definitely didn't live up to the hype. The pork belly was good, and the one I ordered with an egg was definitely the best, but it definitely didn't wow me. I would like the option to order ala-cart. I get the sharing plates shtick, but when eating dinner with co-workers, this isn't the easiest route. \n\nThe spicy mango cocktail was good, probably priced about right. Overall I spent about $40 and came out feeling underwhelmed. I'll try again, but it's hard to stomach that price for just the atmosphere when there are so many other amazing taco joints right down the street on Mass Ave or in Fountain Square.",

It was spacious and clean, the service was great, and the food was amazing. They were able to make a Turkey Gobbler Sandwich for me with a side of cranberry sauce even though it is no longer on the menu. It was a generous portion of perfectly cooked comfort food! The long roll that held the stuffing, turkey, gravy, and cranberry sauce was evidently from a local bakery. So fresh and homemade tasting! For dessert, I chose to take a chocolate covered cheesecake to-go. All in all, my meal came to $18. Not bad! I'd happily return to try the club and more of the tempting desserts!",

No knife needed, cut throught it with my fork alone!  The taste was up there with the likes of Bern's, but not quite as good.  Also, we had the mac-n-cheese, which I highly recommend.

Unfortunately, much of the food tastes like it has been lying in their freezer a long time.\n\nOur service was very brusque, but many restaurants are famous for that, so I expected it, and it didn't bother me.  There's a restaurant in Boston called Durgin Park where they yell at you and the customers love it.  Our waitress was however, very efficient and came around a couple times to check on us.\n\nWe ordered what we thought would be the safest items possible, an open-faced reuben and an open-faced hot turkey sandwich.  I feel really sorry for those who have been brave enough to order fish.  Yikes.  \n\nAnyways the corn beef was fine, cheese was fine, rye bread was soggy and had muted flavor, it was probably mass-produced and bland on purpose.  They put cardboard-tasting cole slaw in the sandwich, and on the side.  This stuff was seriously awful.  The fries were only slightly below average, a little dry, not greasy.  \n\nThe turkey gravy was impressively house-made, but tasteless.  How did we know?  It was lumpy!  A side of mashed potatoes, couldn't tell if they were powdered.  Asparagus so large it looked almost like green carrots.  And of course, overcooked and mushy.\n\nThis place survives I think because most of its customers have grown old along with it.",

I was with a group of people and we could not have asked for more accommodating servers -- going about their tasks quickly and quietly. All very polite. So far, so good, right?\n\nThen the food came. The shrimp cocktail was pretty good, with the expected jumbo shrimp, well cooked and chilled. However the cocktail sauce was very bland and really tasted almost like pure ketchup. \n\nThere were four of us at dinner, all ordering steaks. \nI ordered medium rib eye, but my steak came out extra rare and was so laden with fat it was inedible. The server quickly took it away and replaced it with a better steak, properly cooked , but it was a little surprising given the high prices here, that a really bad piece of meat like that got through he kitchen. \n\nMy replacement steak was cooked perfectly but the flavor was just okay. The mashed potatoes were nice and silky with a light butter flavor, but the asparagus was barely cooked before it hit the grill. So although the spears looked quite nice, they were almost raw inside (and yes I like my veggies al dente too). \nI did not partake in dessert but my dining companions did and they did like the carrot cake.\nI was the only person in my group who finished their steak ( incl two filets) and the steaks were not huge -- so what does this tell you? When our server asked my companions if they'd like to take the rest of their steak home, all said \"no thanks\".\n\nSo despite the nice ambiance and great service at Flemings, I cannot really recommend it, except for perhaps drinks at the bar. The price point here is just much too high to put up with a very average steak dinner. \nSome chains like this have replaced real chefs with 'cooks' to save a lot of money. I don't know if that's the case here, but someone running the kitchen is asleep at the switch.",

Si, putos, tengo ATM!,\" I knew we were in for an irreverent good time. (Though it's worth noting that I probably would go 5 stars if it weren't for the cash-only thing....putos!)\n\nI was immediately struck, after being seated, by two positives: 1) the menu offers a handful of great choices that are very inexpensive, and 2) our waitress was unbelievably nice. It's amazing how much an upbeat server who appears to like his/her job can make a restaurant experience. \n\nI got the volcano burrito, which was very good. A small critique is that, if it's possible for a dish to have too much cheese, and I'm not sure that it is, this burrito may have been near that threshold. Also, it wasn't that hot, but they give you a ton of delicious sauces, some of them homemade, to spicy it up. I also got the diablo black beans, which were awesome. The guacamole was also fantastic. \n\nI hereby dedicate this paragraph to the bloody mary. It was one of the best ones I've had in a long time. It is quite spicy, which I love, and they accent it with cumin and chili powder to give it a Mexican feel. Highly recommend it.\n\nBonus: they had a pinball machine in the back that somehow had 3 free plays loaded up. So each of us played a round on our trips to the bathroom. \n\nI can't wait to come back here and try the brunch.",

But because this is a small restaurant, I imagine it does fill up at busier times.\n\nHaving enjoyed their Mac-N-Cheese at the annual Yelp event in April, I was delighted we could substitute that for fries on one of our orders at no additional charge. Because the burgers were delicious. I'll rave about them first. Mine was cooked more than my requested medium well, but was simply so good that I was able to completely ignore the overcooking. The fries were also very delicious. But the highlight of my meal was that homemade Mac-N-Cheese! The bowl was huge - more than plenty to share between the two of us. Piping-hot creamy pasta, covered with bacon & a thick layer of cheese - glorious. Sooo good!\n\nOur server was very attentive but not over-bearing. She was friendly & helpful, sharing her opinion of a couple dishes that had caught our eye for future visits. But, we also appreciated that she wasn't terribly chatty. Later in the evening, we saw a sign on the ad board about 70¢ wings on Wednesdays, and hubs almost ordered a few to take home for his lunch, due to our server raving about them. Even though he ultimately didn't order any (only because he wasn't able to finish his burger), we are definitely returning for those wings, as well as a few other entrees... And that amazing Mac-N-Cheese.",

The cheese fries must be a favorite since I saw a few orders being eaten on my way in. \nThe ice cream prices are a bargain, and the serving size is enough to make you stuffed and looking forward to your next visit. \nThey've been around for awhile, so its good to see a quality business still in the area.",

As the only pho place in Isla Vista, my theory is that there's no pressure from competition for them to cook up quality food for a good price. The broth (which has a pretty dominant influence on your meal, and my favorite part) was extremely greasy. Gross.\n\nI've never tried anything else here but I noticed a lot of others were getting the fried rice. I came here to fix my pho craving, but my recommendation is to just wait until you can get your hands on something better.",

Each of the items came in small servings, and we tried a variety of items including beets, eggplant, Brussels sprouts, octopus (you have to eat octopus given the name of the restaurant), steak tartare, and broccoli. The only thing I wasn't too fond of was the Brussels sprout. The broccoli was also a bit dry. But the preparation and presentation of each item was different than anything I've had. It's a fun place to go for tasting, but I wouldn't recommend going there if you are really hungry. \n\nOur server was lovely; she offered many suggestions and even comped one of the dishes because one of our choice dishes was not available.",

  "text": "4.5\n\nCheu Noodle Bar is a quaint, yet eccentric little spot serving up soul-warming ramen & other asian small dishes. Happy hour is Monday-Friday from 5-6:30, which is when I came to catch up with two friends over drinks and ramen. \n\nThere's limited seating, and you can't sit at the bar while waiting for a table to open up, as it is reserved for sit-down eating. No problem - we grabbed a drink and waited standing up! However, the one downside: there is very limited standing room. The three of us were against the wall, and had to dodge around waitresses every so often when they came out with new dishes. While waiting for ~40 minutes, this became a little irritating, and the reason I knocked the rating down. \n\nThe drinks were good! My favorite was the TEEN SPIRIT (tequila, aperol, lychee, & lime). \n\nWhile waiting, the kitchen accidentally made an extra order of the mojo dumplings, and we were lucky enough to be treated to those - which helped soothe our rumbling bellies. SCORE!\n\nFood: \nMOJO PORK DUMPLINGS ($7) // five dumplings filled with pork, and sitting in a flavorful, sweet & spicy sauce. I;m not sure what it was, but there was definitely a spice in the sauce that gave it its MOJO!\n\nBLACK GARLIC WINGS ($10) // Crispy coated wings bursting with flavors - there's cilantro, there's garlic, there's sesame. The wings are full of juicy & flavorful meat.\n\nMISO RAMEN ($14) // A classic take on Ramen. A warm bowl of broth & noodles, with shredded pork shoulder, a soy egg, black garlic, & mustard greens. The noodles were perfectly cooked without getting soggy, and the pork was tender. Definitely a good & hearty bowl of ramen perfect for a cold winter's eve.\n\nBRISKET RAMEN ($14) // Japanese food meets Jewish food, and births Jewanese ramen. This was a unique take on the classic dish - there were traditional ramen falvors (kimchi, sesame red chili broth), and then some unusual ones - brisket ramen & a large matzo ball. It was fun to see this twist on Ramen! \n\nOverall, the food was incredible. Cheu packs in plenty of flavor into each of their dishes. I'll definitely be back, but will probably go at a less popular time - to avoid the small waiting area!",

I have had many steaks here in the past and have never been overly impressed with their quality, but the ambience almost makes up for it. On Fridays, McMahons  packs in the Foothills hoi paloi with a sweet happy hour on their twinkly adobe brick patio, and rarely can so much Elaine Benis-style, rhythm-free body movement be witnessed in one place. The cigar selection is outrageous, and tobacco aficionados are revered here, another rarity. The old school movers and shakers certainly still shake it up at McMahons, for better or worse.",

As previously described this restaurant is in the back of the Erin Rose bar on Conti next to Bourbon in the Quarter. You go through the small bar to go to the even smaller restaurant. They only offer maybe 5-6 versions of po boys at a time so it is a limited menu. I had the pork belly po boy and also ordered the potato salad for a side. Total with tax was $13.  \n\nThe po boy is a 7\" which seems a little small. However, it was very, very good. I like their bread (it comes from a Vietnamese bakery in NO East) too. The potato salad was also very tasty. \n\nThe \"restaurant\" has one high table for 4 people. The other seating options are along a bar that adjoins the wall. This place is small. If you want a drink you have to go get it in the bar and pay separately. Also the restaurant only accepts cash.\n\nThe chef uses all homemade ingredients...this is NOT your typical po boy shop. It is actually a high end product that you can taste the difference. My favorite po boy is still at The Cajun Stop in Houston however this place comes close.\n\nI highly recommend the pork belly po boy. I am sure the others are equally good too.",

This may be the best thing we did in New Orleans, actually pronounced Nawlins by the locals...one of the interesting tidbits Mr. Renee shared with us.  Covered a lot of stuff about the storm, what the city, state, and people have and are doing to bring this city back from a watery grave.  Everybody heard a lot of news coverage, but listening to someone that lived through the experience and is very knowledgeable really brings  this disaster to life.

Bread and cheese becomes delicious fast casual cuisine. Born in New York, the brainchild of a twenty something selling hot sammies from a window operation, it now extends as far west as Minnesota. The Newtown store is the second in PA; the first in King of Prussia Mall. \n\nI caught it on its first day. It seemed the entire staff was on hand to help out. They wore black T's with the Melt Shop logo on the back, and ball caps similarly adorned. The place was crowded with assorted families and kids just out of Council Rock North's last week of school. The music system played on a rock loop that made for a very noisy atmosphere that was unnecessary given that it just interfered with conversation and made ordering a shouting contest. \n\nJust turn off the sound system, please! \n\nThe food was very good. I went with the Maple Bacon Grilled Cheese (maple cured thick bacon, cheddar/American slices) within decent bread slices, and Shop Tots (tater tots sprinkled with grated cheese and mild spices). Plenty of chewy flavor inside the hot grilled pain, and well deep fried crisped tots. Liked them both alot. Drank a bottle of their signature water from GIVN, an outfit that brings clean H2O to communities in need. \n\nPrices add up quickly, so if you want a shake with that, lunch reaches $15 in a hurry. \n\nMelt Shop also does variations with fried chicken and burgers, both of which looked good on other tables. Will make it back to check them out. I'll give them a while to figure things out first.\n\nShout out to Davide, one of the managers, with whom I had an informative discussion about the store.",

  "text": "Ultimately, Sweet Alley is a very forgettable establishment in Isla Vista. It's kind of cool that we have our own fro-yo and candy shop, but considering that I went like, once three years ago and just recently mustered up the courage to try it again, there isn't much to say about this place.\n\nWith their \"re-opening\" a year ago, management has introduced several Asian desserts to the menu, including the beloved egg waffle. Emily L., my significant other, and I each ordered one of their egg waffle sundaes, which comes with a large scoop of ice cream, fruit, and chocolate wafer roll. And so did the 20 people in front of and behind us.\n\nThe one aspect that was clear from the start was how understaffed this place is. There was one student at the front taking orders and making desserts, and on a Sunday night, with about 20 people out the door, that really piles up. After a 10-minute wait, another girl walked in (perhaps she was on her break with an hour left before closing?) and lazily began refilling the DIY fro-yo toppings bar. Hey, your co-worker is wildly swamped at the front and there's no one in line for chocolate chips. Start making egg waffles, or something!\n\nThat being said, the sweet blonde girl running the shop really did an excellent job of staying on task and keeping it cool. There were several things out of her control that this place really has to improve on if they care about making their customers happier. The staffing issue is one. Another was that the scooped ice cream was super icy. I'm talking \"finding ice pockets in the cream\" icy. Fro-yo might be a better bet, so stay away if you don't want to shock your molars every time you chomp down. Management should also consider paring down the menu (cold brew nitro coffee! Egg waffles! Sago soup! Acai bowls! Sour cherry gummy coke bottles!) to maintain quality control.\n\nAll that said, the egg waffle was just okay. Too dense for my liking. It wasn't strawberry season, so the fresh sliced ones on top of my sundae were kind of sour, but the presentation was pretty. What else can ya say for $5.95?",

So because it's lacking that full \"food court\" section, this gets a solid \"A-OK\". So, it has a pretty great sandwich and sushi bar but it's lacking 2/3 of the menu from the larger stores like my favorite, the vegetarian burger.\n\nThe staff is very helpful, friendly, and patient.\n\nThere is a Trader Joe's right across the street and I love TJ's but the feeling I get from every visit to any TJ's is a sense of urgency and mayhem.

Whole Foods is just another type of experience and I like the toned down vibe where I can stand in one spot for a bit while I read all of the ingredients and weigh my options.\n\nThe staff keeps telling me that this Whole Foods will close down and reopen a few miles south in a larger location to accommodate more items and I don't know if it'll ever happen since it's been years since they said this and honestly, I'm ok if they don't move just because they're so close.\n\nParking: Large shared lot\nPrice: Whole Foods in general is more expensive than any grocery store",

Sitting outside, eating your ice cream, you'll feel like you're in a Norman Rockwell painting. Very quaint.",

There were chicken soup, pasta with two different sauces,  various topping pizza, desserts including brownie, Cinnamon ban and apple Pizza, Boston cream pizza. I loved the personal Pizza. Customer can choose the bread, the sauce and 4 Topping. They baked it fresh for you. Mine was  pizza bread, spinach alfredo sauce, anchovy, beef, sausage, and chicken topping. It was so delicious and fresh! The soup and salad were decent. The cinnamon ban was my top favorite. They were so buttery, soft, general creamy icing on the top and sprinkle of the cinnamon power-very very good. The sitting area was clean with some arcade game machines along the wall. With Christmas music playing at the background, carton showing on TV, the ambience was happy and layback.  The employee were very friendly and helpful and the pricing was excellent- All day all you can eat buffet for 6.99 per adult, where can you beat this in Tampa?",

You must come to Drago's and order the chargrilled oysters. It is one of life's best experiences. My life has been dramatically altered by indulging in the great Delicacies. I won't even take a star off when it took me an hour and 15 minutes to be seated and then another 45 minutes for my oysters to reach my table. The oysters are nice and medium-sized. When they arrive to your table they are encrusted with Parmesan cheese garlic and dripping in butter. And just in case you need help stopping up all the butter and the Chardon is on your platter, they bring you a loaf of fresh French bread. This is not diet friendly nor would I want it to be. Every voice turkey was delicious. They were nicely shocked and I never found a piece of shell in the Oyster. It is now my go-to spot when I'm in New Orleans after I get off the airplane to go stand in line for Drago's.",

The largest popcorn was $7 and they had a bunch of other treats you could choose from. The seats themselves were all on one level and reclined.

I wish there was a nada closer to me because I'd go back in a heartbeat. \n\nWe had a table of 6 and our waiter handled all of our questions, orders and checks flawlessly. We started with the trio salsas and build your own queso. Both were perfect for sharing. We got the pork belly mixed in the queso and it was so amazing. The 3 different salsas were all really good too.\n\nFor my brunch I got the eggs benedicto. I really liked the avocado, egg and cream sauce combination. Something new compared to your standard eggs Benedict. My husband got the enchiladas and another friend got the fish tacos. Both were excellent! Only one person didn't like their dish and it was the geotta sausage Benedict. If you're not familiar goetta is a grain based sausage so the texture and flavors are a bit odd.",

The Spring Mix is loaded with Green Apple slices, Walnuts, Feta, and first class Balsamic. The times I have eaten in house, everything has been well presented, tasty, and in abundance.

  "text": "******WARNING!! As of November 2016, the VAST MAJORITY of the 267 reviews found on this page are NOT for this Rouses Market (i.e., the one on Royal St. in the French Quarter), but for the Rouses Market on Baronne St. in the Central Business District/Warehouse District.******\n\nThis review is for the Rouses Market located at 701 Royal St. in the French Quarter. It ranks a solid 3 stars in my book because of the following factors;\n1) It is essentially the only real grocery store located in the French Quarter.\n2) Its product line leans toward natural products. In many ways, the Rouses chain tries to compete not only with supermarkets, but with Whole Foods as well.\n3) It is open for long hours each day, and in fact, is open until 1 AM.\n\nHaving said that, I will admit, as others have noted, that the store is incredibly small, and that it has only one small set of doors, located at a front corner of the store, through which all customers, and also all deliveries and tradespeople, must all somehow manage to pass.\n\nBecause of the small size of the store, the selection and range of items offered is rather limited. For example, I recently spent five minutes trying to locate the section that stocks nutritional supplements, and, having failed at that task, I asked a grocery clerk for the location of the nutritional supplements section. When he confessed that he had never heard of nutritional supplements, I gave him  some examples, citing products such as \"vitamin C, or calcium tablets\". He searched in vain for five minutes, and then gave up  He and I then went to the front desk, where I asked  a woman (who identified herself as a manager) the same question. Much as happened with the clerk earlier, she confessed that she had never heard of such a product, and, thus I shared with her the examples (cited above) that I had shared with the clerk. Looking  at me blankly, she vaguely pointed me toward a spot in a specific aisle that, of course  bore no  trace of  nutritional supplements. A conversation with another manager later confirmed that they do not carry nutritional supplements.\n\nI had much the same experience days earlier in trying to locate Dr. Bronner's liquid soaps, a line of natural and organic soaps which are, and have been, a staple of natural foods stores for over 60 years. The manager had never heard of such a product line, and admitted that he did not carry it. In contrast, even the tiniest and shabbiest Whole Foods store, even a one-star rated one, always offers a wide selection of this staple product line. \n\nNow it is time to get back to the header paragraph of my review: The sad reality is that as of Nov. 2016, the VAST MAJORITY of the 267 reviews found on this page are NOT for this Rouses Market, but rather for the Rouses Market on Baronne St. in the Central Business District/Warehouse District. In fact, a quick survey that I conducted yesterday of all 267 reviews indicates that at least 85% of them, particularly the 5 star reviews, are for the vastly larger Rouses Market located in the warehouse district. \n\nSo, if you should see on this page a review (and there are many of them) that claims that this store sports any of the following features:\n-- tons of free parking\n-- an outdoor open-air dining area with garden\n-- a rooftop herb garden (some reviewers have called it \"aerophonic\", whatever that is...) where you can prance happily through the aisles of herbs\n-- a burrito bar\n-- a coffee bar\n-- rooftop overflow parking\n-- a fresh pizza bar/counter\n-- a huge selection of single-bottle beers\n-- a sushi bar/counter\n-- never a line at the \"many checkout registers\"\n-- wide aisles\n-- an amazing and wide selection of foods and other natural products\n-- a fresh seafood counter\n-- a fresh meat counter\n\n....well, those reviews are TOTALLY WRONG!!! None of those things listed above are true for this store, but they are true for the Baronne St. store, which is about ten thousand times larger than the French Quarter (FQ) store.\n\nHowever, the FQ store does have a deli counter, albeit a very small one, and the staffers there are very friendly.\n\nSome pluses about the admittedly very tiny FQ store: \n-- It does carry a good selection of yogurt and kefir products.\n-- The refrigerated products section offers a limited array of  pre-packaged sushi products made at its larger sister store. \n-- It often carries bottles of  egg nog in the dairy section.\n-- Most of the staffers try very hard to be helpful.\n\nLastly, let us address the question that has been burning in my mind for the past week: How could it possibly be that over 80% of the reviews found on this page are really for the much larger store on Baronne Street in the Warehouse district? How could so many reviewers possibly make the same mistake? After hard deliberation, I feel  that these gross errors must be chalked up to the fact that there is a very high rate of consumption, and abuse, of alcohol and drugs in the FQ, and in all of New Orleans, and thus...!",

When I showed up to the Visitor's Center I had to pin a number on my shirt and all of this other serious stuff. Gazelles were everywhere. Litheputians from the land of Liltheput and shit. \n\nWhat happened after the fear and anxiety in my PBR laden mindbelly clenched itself in sweaty agony is a strange tale to tell. Yet I can relay you this much. I ran my first F'Real Race and it was 6 miles of my consciousness inhabiting a place in my soulbrain that I still suffer some remnants of PTSD. Thank you shamanfriend for leading me into the desert known as \"There are some big ass hills in Forest Park that you didn't know existed but in conquering them you will live.\"\n\nForest Park contains many great memories for many great people. Weddings, Golfing, Softball, Public Sex, Fishing. For me, Forest Park now carries that time I ran, I ran up a hill, I thought only of some goddamned red shoes bouncing in front of me and I won. \n\nI won.\n\nThe End.",

  "text": "A dessert place with a long line can mean two things. One, it is an Instagram photo-worthy hype. Two, the dessert tastes really amazing. Of course, it can also be a combination of both factors, but for Ted Drewes, it is simply the latter option. The dessert served here is solely vanilla custard, and you can play around and customize it by adding some sauces or toppings or by making it a concrete, shake, malt, or a few other variations. Choose from one of the menu options, or get creative and make your own flavor combination. Either way, whatever you do, the custard remains the star of the show, and what makes it so good is that it is high quality while staying simple and unpretentious. It is super creamy and looks, feels, and tastes homemade. \n\nThere really is not anything fancy in appearances about the storefront or the custard at all, but the lack of disguise is what makes it so charming. You order at a window and either eat your custard outside or take it to-go with you somewhere. The line may be long, but it moves fast. I placed my order and then received my dessert almost instantaneously. If you want to avoid the line completely, go on a day when the weather is terrible and people do not want to be outside.\n\nThere are plenty of ice cream places in any town so I will give you a fact that might convince you to make a visit like it convinced me to. According to SoolNua's 2016 annual World ICECREAM Index, Ted Drewes was rated as the world's best ice cream. I am no connoisseur and have no idea how prestigious SoolNua's World ICECREAM Index is, but it sounds pretty cool. I do not know if Ted Drewes is the best custard in the world, but I can say that the custard is pretty darn good and worth a visit.",

Used to be my go-to, and as a guy who works in a thai restaurant and has traveled to thailand, that says a lot.  I ordered beef salad and green curry.  Two Thai staples...both were all but inedible.  Oversalted is an understatement.  The green curry tasted salty and had virtually no coconut flavor - I have seen some Thai places use cream to cut cost on curry, but this seemed like pure heavy cream and no coconut milk at all...and soooo salty.  The beef salad had uncooked beef to start, and was even saltier than the green curry...could hardly get it down.  even the white rice  (which was sushi rice and not jasmine rice) was very salty, which I just don't understand. My wife (from Thailand) agreed 100% and said that she couldn't eat it either.\n\nSorry to say, but I will never go here again.  Too bad.",

  "text": "Dining at the Prime Rib restaurant, which is located inside the Warwick Hotel in the affluent Rittenhouse Square area is not as wonderful as it used to be.  It was once a place where you would feel like you were walking into the middle of the past century and beyond to find Don Draper and his mad men croonies, ah times change and everything else along with it, but this time it was a sin.\n \nWe were early for our reservations and were going to have a seat at the bar, but decided to check in with the host and he offered to seat us right away, seeing we were famished, we took him up on his generous offer, Food! Our server immediately greeted us and offered us drinks, hubby had a coke and I had an excellent dry martini, served in a rather large cocktail glass, well chilled and made to perfection.\n \nOn the Prime Rib page of reviews on Yelp, it says to mention Yelp and you and anyone else at your table will receive a complimentary appetizer and so I did, which he was not at all enthusiastic about and it clearly showed. Then I pulled a rabbit out of my hat or rather a printed certificate from an Open Table offer that they and the Prime Rib had made publicly, to pay $25.00 up front to receive $50.00 off your bill when all was said and done. \n \nThis really did not thrill him and he was very obvious about his distaste in our lack of class ( in his mind ) to take the Prime Rib up on their own offers. Not only this but several times our server and a group of other staff members were nearby our table, talking about us and looking right at us, like how could we?! Even over at the service area for the bar, they turned and stared at us, laughing and talking. I'm serious folks, it was down right rude, made me feel like a clown and was the beginning of the most absurd service I have ever experienced.\n \nWe sat at least 20-30 minutes waiting for menus, while hubby stewed watching others being serviced and finally received our Yelp appetizer which was one large ( Diver, I'm assuming ) scallop each, wrapped in practically raw bacon on a small bed of baby spinach leaves. The scallop was cooked perfectly, I gave hubby my bacon, but he and I both agreed it was too raw to eat and then we were handed menus, which was a good forty minutes after we had been seated.\n \nWe shared the most bland bowl of lobster bisque that was served in a cool tureen style crock, absolutely no hint of sherry and I used to love their bisque, our waiter brought us a hot pepper sherry sauce in a bottle, but we passed, as it was very hot and the sherry did not even attempt to shine through.\n \nThe large oyster Rockefeller were outstanding, the escargot were tender and swimming in a garlic sauce with baby mushroom caps and a thick slice of grilled bread to dip into the sauce. The jumbo lump crab cake was large and pure but very un-adventurous other than that and was served with a lousy cocktail sauce. I had to giggle silently as the table next to us commented on their choice of sauce to serve with a lump crab cake. I myself had asked for the mustard sauce that was previously mentioned in their crab claw appetizer and it worked to help.\n \nWhen our meals came our server finally grabbed my hubby's longtime empty coke glass and refilled it and asked if I would like anything else. I asked what chardonnay they had by the glass, he offered several, not mentioning the names but the regions and I chose a Sonoma, when he brought it he had the label totally covered and poured me a sip, I asked to see the label and I was thrilled to see that it was Sonoma Cutre, one of my favorites and then he was about to walk away when I said excuse me, can you please pour my glass of wine? Oops.\n \nHubby was served a huge roast of Prime rib and he was kind enough to cut the bones off first to save for my onion soup for Christmas, his meat was cooked to perfection, tender, flavorful and juicy, however my filet was a big let down and we had already spent so much time there and just wanted to leave. I had ordered it medium rare and when I cut into the first third of it, the first cut was medium well, no pink or red whatsoever, but the center of the steak was barely pink.\n \nI was not going to say anything, but for a dry, flavorless piece of meat at $38.00 and the thinnest, un-flavorful bearnaise sauce I have ever been served, I thought this is so wrong, class or not speak up. I did and he argued with me! He said well the outer edges will be well done, I had cut one third into my steak, come on buddy this is not the first place I have had a steak is what I wanted to say, but instead I showed him the center and said it is barely a hint of pink and even the top and bottom of that was well done!\n \nTo be continued in another update, this is how upsetting this dining experience was.",

  "text": "We have passed by the entrance of this park quite a few times in the past so we finally decided to check this park out  this afternoon. I was not able to find a lot of detailed info about this park and could not find a trail map on the internet.\n\nWhen you first enter this park  it has a real concrete/golf course'ish feel to it. (sucks but it gets better, see below).  The main park is sectioned/labeled by lots (lots A - J ??).  It is a mecca for children/families. We encountered at least 5 different baseball/softball fields, numerous soccer fields, playgrounds,  large sand volleyball courts, a small skateboard park and a basketball court. Throughout the park is roofed pavilions/gazebos with picnic tables and  large BBQ grills (quite large grills, very nice). They also have a large concession stand/building  (was closed today) that has a eating area with built-in tabletop checkers/chess games. The park has a large amphitheater (2200 square foot stage)  that hosts summer movies and summer concert series. You bring your own lawn chairs,  the lawn will hold approximately 4,500 people with unobstructed sight and sound according to what  I have read. Not too far from the amphitheater is a retention pond that is stocked with fish (no fishing allowed). Some of the fish were huge (probably well fed by humans?),  they were practically jumping out the water. (they looked like golden and yellow carp?). \n\nAround the perimeter of the park is a interconnecting asphalt paths for walking/jogging/running. Sections of the paths intertwine into wooded areas that also have more picnic tables. The park has outdoor  'fitness stations' scattered throughout the park with equipment for doing pull-ups/chin-ups, push-ups, ab leg lifts, monkey bar, etc. \n\nWe happened to park at lot 'E\". At the edge of that  lot we found a trail head that goes deep into the woods. We were pleasantly surprised. We found numerous trails. Some of the trails were 'groomed' (covered in wood chips), this is excellent for trail running (it was seriously comfortable on the feet).  Other sections of the trail have wooden boardwalk sections that cross over  huge wildflowers/fern like plants (I wish I knew what the plant species is called).  We also walked on less groomed/unmarked trails. We encountered a cedar lake for fishing (need a permit) and a wildlife/wetlands area. We also found a small hill with some dried-up creek beds/streams that had the exposed tree roots that we walked up on, very cool.\n\nWe liked this park and are looking forward to checking out some of the other trails.",

After reading a couple of reviews, we settled on Killer Po'boys which happen to be right around the block from our rental. Upon entering the restaurant, we were pleased to see its low key atmosphere that was both inviting and aesthetically pleasing. The woman at the counter was a doll, eagerly helping us order while asking questions and making recommendations of what we might like. I decided on breakfast style po'boy with house made chorizo and egg while my fried opted for a curried goat variation of the popular New Orleans dish. While waiting on our food, we took in the restaurant decor which was a nice mix of local flair. We even had the chance to read a few articles about the \"new age po'boy movement\" and how restaurants like this were changing the concept of what a po'boy is. It didn't take long for us to receive our order. I was surprised at how large the po'boy was, especially since it was rather inexpensive. After taking that first bite, I don't think I can ever go back to the original po'boy again. The chorizo was flavorful but not too spicy and the egg was perfectly cooked. I had a chance to sample my friend's curried goat and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. The goat was braised perfectly and the curry seasoning took much of the gamines out of the meat. This place will definitely be one that I frequent every time I'm in the New Orleans area.",

  "text": "Looking for a low key seafood place with great staff and food?  This place delivers.  We were ready to enjoy a lazy evening grazing on food and drinks.  We started with the grilled oysters, shrimp trio (coconut, buffalo and firecracker), frog legs and seafood gumbo.\n\nLuckily the beautiful char grilled taste of the oysters made up for the fact that they spent too much time on the heat.  Even cooked oysters need to have a blast of juice when you take a bite.  The shrimp, for the most part, were very well executed, crispy, flavorful and not over cooked.  The buffalo's were jumbo sized and had the right amount of buttery hot sauce heat and crunch, the firecracker were smaller but also crisped and expertly coated with sauce.  I didn't taste the coconut coated crustaceans, but the verdict was they tasted like they came out of a Sysco bag.  So a miss.  The frog legs were super plump, lightly coated and fried perfectly.  The meat was so tender and fresh, but it was missing seasoning.  A side of melted salted butter with garlic would have been the perfect accompaniment and the right fix for the lack of salt and flavor punch the legs needed.\n\nNext came another order of firecracker shrimp (they were one diner's Achilles heel), seared ahi tuna and a cup of the seafood bisque.  Tuna was deemed quite excellent, but the sweet drizzle was said to overwhelm the dish. More heat less sugar was the preference.  The soup had potential, but upon arriving, it had all the signs of coagulation from not being stirred before serving.  Roux based soups require a careful eye and don't have the best longevity.  In the end, it loosened up and was decent, but not a favorite.  The man and woman duo providing the live music that evening were fantastic.  Their song choices that included James Taylor, Neil Young, and Santana provided the perfect back drop for a great evening.  Mini hiccups, but overall great food, music, drinks and company.",

After a call to the restaurant, someone assured us that the driver was nearby. We had our order about five minutes later. \n\nRather than going for Indian, we tried some of the \"Indo Chinese\" selections instead. I'd say they were very similar to some of Han Dynasty's offerings, with just a hint of Indian spices. The two dishes we tried were both good (chicken in hot garlic sauce and chicken in kung pao sauce). We ordered one mild and one medium and I thought both were pretty spicy, especially for my weakling palate. We received two containers of basmati rice along with the order. \n\nWhile I might try Tiffin again, I probably won't go the delivery route.",

Tried the egg roll, cucumbers, Dan Dan noodles, and hot chicken. I appreciated the freshness of the egg roll and it was perfectly crispy. The cucumbers were the perfect combination of spicy and cool and crunchy. The Dan dan noodles were absolute perfection. I have been searching for noodles like these since having them at various places in NYC and have not found them until now. Luvi has them, and I love that restaurant, but the noodles are not what I've been searching for. I am still thinking about the Dan dan noodles from Blue Giant. I saw all the rave reviews about the hot chicken and my husband devoured it enthusiastically-  I didn't love it as much as he did - I don't know why - it was very good though! I can't wait to try every single thing at this awesome place. Hooray Blue Giant!!!!",

  "text": "The worst mexican food I've ever had in my life. I am from San Diego, I'm visiting Tennessee and was craving mexican food. Mexican food here is nothing compared to San Diego mexican food. \n\nThe chips and salsa were good, the guacamole was very bland. Margaritas were great and a good price for the pitcher. \n\nThe food was terrible. The chicken in the crunchy taco had absolutely no flavor and tasted old. The taco itself was tiny, it hardly had any toppings on it and the shell was not crunchy. The cheese enchilada was very bland and the sauce they used was tasteless. The chilie relleno was odd, normally they have cheese in them but this one had chicken. Even though I did not order that. The chille itself was not bad but like I said the chicken here is flavorless. Surprisingly the rice and beans were the worst thing on the plate. The beans had such an odd flavor that I couldn't even take 2 bites of it. The flavor completely ruined my appetite. \n\nOverall, I'm sure if you're from the south this food might be authentic to you. If you're from San Diego or anywhere where they have authentic delicious mexican food you will not like this.",

  "text": "I'm not a huge fan of frozen yogurt, but I must say that Yogurtland really delivers where it counts (at least what is most important to me).  Good selection of flavors.  Good taste.  Texture is not too soft.  Good variety of toppings.  Decent syrups.  And very reasonably priced ($0.30 per ounce).\n\nThis Yogurtland, located on State Street in Santa Barbara, is not much different than other Yogurtlands out there.  I tried their pistachio flavor, which was good.  I also tried their lychee flavor--I definitely could taste the lychee; decent but maybe not for me.\n\nThey have a lot of toppings and I went with some Fruity Pebbles, Cap'n Crunch and bananas.  They had a lot of other stuff you would come to expect such as other kinds of fresh fruit, candy bars, cheesecake bites, chocolate chips, and so on.  They had nice big Ghirardelli syrup dispensers.  I tried the caramel and it was good.\n\nI went a little bigger than I usually do and my total was in the $3 range.  Usually, I'm in the $2.50 range at Yogurtland.  Service was pretty quick.  There was a little bit of a line, which is often the case at Yogurtland shops.  It can be a little frustrating because I worry that my frozen yogurt is going to melt.\n\nOf the self-serve frozen yogurt places I've tried, I would have to put Yogurtland at the top (though I could not really tell you what makes one frozen yogurt better than another one so the affordability of Yogurtland is weighing heavily here).  Cherry On Top has a lot of toppings, but their frozen yogurt is too soft.  Menchies has a lot of toppings too and their frozen yogurt has a nice texture, but they are too expensive.  There are other frozen yogurt places out there, but for me at least they don't seem to provide a significant advantage over Yogurtland.\n\nParking is available on the street (though hard to find); parking is also available at a nearby lot that is free for the first 75 minutes.",

  "text": "Short summary: Go here. Go here and eat here. Then do it again, and again, and again.\n\nJuan's has an extensive list of food options, with plenty of veggie friendly options to go with that.  However, who wants to start with the meal? Let's start with the location.\n\nYou are about 2 minutes from Anne Rice's house, and in a very hipster/indie area - far enough from the French Quarter to be away from the crowd, but not too far to walk or drive to places like Cochon or the aforementioned Ex- Anne Rice's house (she sold it). There are all sorts of cool little shops, and parking by meter on the street is simple enough (and plentiful).\n\nOne thing you must get from Juan's is the Chips, Salsa, Guac and Queso. Not only is it delicious, but it's easily large enough for 4 people. Guac was nice and fresh, queso was nice and hot and dip-friendly.  I got the flying enchiladas to go with that, which was one of the few times I didn't eat something exclusively vegetarian. I was however, provided awesome black beans and rice to go with that. \n\nOn the vegetarian front, the sweet & green is delicious, and very large for it's size. Really, the issue here is what Eddie C mentions - there is simply way too much food to eat in a sitting. You're going to have to come here multiple times if you want to have enough room to eat their food. The red & green sauces provided at the table are predictably awesome, and should be generously applied to your personal preference with whatever you order.\n\nI am a guy who can eat for two, and between the appetizer and the flying enchiladas, I was pretty well stuffed here.  Do come here with an empty stomach.",

The inside was surprisingly nice--it had stone walls with nice lighting and comfortable booths and chairs.\n\nThey are getting 5 stars for the food, service, and ambiance. Our waitress was very friendly, cleared plates quickly, and didn't give us any attitude when we gave her our Groupon (I hate when servers do that!). The food was excellent! Everything tasted very fresh, and the salmon and avocado, eel, and spicy tuna were all great. We also ordered the New York roll which had salmon, lobster, and avocado in it. So good! The $40 for the groupon went a long way, and on top of the free edamame we got for checking in on Yelp, I basically had to waddle home. My boyfriend and I really liked this place and will definitely be back!\n\nFYI: It's BYO, and there's a Wine and Spirits shop only a block away, so if you forget to come prepared, no big deal.",

In my lifetime I have enjoyed Benedict dishes in seven U.S. states from the west coast to the east coast and Bourbon & Branch managed to really ruin a potential good meal.

The eggs were under-cooked and also over-salted.\n\nI then tried my friend's hummus and pita, also quite bad.  The pita bread was wet (with water) and the hummus was flavorless AND over-salted.  I am able to prepare better hummus and pita whilst in a coma.\n\nMy husband ordered the chicken and biscuits, the bacon n'beer mac and the branch brined wings.  ALL were over-salted.

I honestly can't explain to you why, other than I didn't think there was much to see here... but I was truly mistaken.\n\nTampa has created a walk along the Hillsborough River that stretches from Water Works Park (near gorgeous Ulele restaurant) all the way to Cotanchobee Fort Brooke Park 2 miles away. The entire walk is truly spectacular with so many things to see such as The Florida Museum of Photographic Arts on one end, The Florida Aquarium at the other end and Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park somewhere in the middle.\n\nThe park is home to concerts and festivals in the summer and ice skating in the winter. The park encompasses 8 acres and includes a \"Great Lawn\" for concerts and other performances as well as leisurely picnics, kite flying and frisbee throwing. There is a dog run, plenty of paved trails, restrooms, and two interactive fountains. One of which we watched as children and parents alike found great joy in the simplicity of water sprouting from the ground!\n\nYou can truly make a full day of it here. Just across the river via the Kennedy Blvd bridge is Plant Park, part of the grounds for the beautiful and historic University of Tampa. Directly next to the park on one side is Kiley Garden and on the other is Glazer Children's Museum. Also nearby is the must see Sacred Hearts Catholic Church. If you are interested in beautiful architecture, you won't want to miss it.\n\nThe playground @ Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park is designed to fight childhood obesity by combining video games with exercise. How cool is that!!!\n\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nAside from being a really amazing place to just hang out, it is also responsible and environmentally friendly. The sprinkler system uses reclaimed water and LED lighting is installed throughout the park. The views are spectacular and the overall feeling you get from just being here is one of serenity and peace. If I lived in Tampa, I'd find myself here more often than not. Some might even question if I had a home at all because my visits to this park would be so frequent and lasting. LOL\n\n\n\n2016/50",

  "text": "On the second day of our family trip in New Orleans, we had plans to get to the aquarium but since it was pouring and freezing outside, we didn't want to go to any local hotspot that would have us waiting outside for too long. Since I came to New Orleans before, I knew that Drago's is a fairly large restaurant that would probably be able to seat a party of 7 fairly quickly. So we hopped in the taxi and were seated almost immediately. It was fun to see all the waiters wearing Saints jerseys on gameday as the diners were completely focused on the game around the bar. The po-boys were big enough that in retrospect I would want to share a plate with someone. The shrimp alfredo was pretty good too. \n\nPreviously, we tried the chargrilled and raw oysters here and they weren't as good as Acme Oyster House but they were fine. Come here for convenience.",

It's very smooth and creamy.  I love Ted Drewes andI have never been disappointed by anything I have ordered there.  I visit the Chippewa location every time I visit St. Louis no matter the time of year (as long as they're open) or what the temperature is outside.  The staff is always friendly and helpful.  Once I wanted to bring some frozen custard home with me to California and they packed my order in dry ice so it would fit on a small cooler I could pack in my suite case.  They did such a good job of it that it made it home completely in tact. On my most recent visit on 12/11/2013 it was 21º outside and there was still of a line of people waiting to purchase there frozen custard.  You a place that serves ice cold desert is popular when people line up sub freezing temperatures to enjoy it.  If you never tried frozen custard you should where ever you can get it.  If you're in St. Louis you should expend any effort necessary to get yourself to Ted Drewes.",

I ordered the Palm Sugar Ribs and the Short Rib Khao Soi. When I got home and unpacked everything it smelled and looked perfect. They packed the soup for travel. The broth in one container, the crispy noodles in a container, and the protein, noodles, and veg in another container. I assembled it in a large bowl. The short rib was tasty and very tender. I prefer this to chicken in the dish. The noodles were well cooked but still had a nice chew. The red onions were fresh. There was a nice briny flavor from the pickled cabbage. Then there was the broth. It's creamy, spicy, bright and acidic from the lime, and so so good. You should sell it by the gallon. I'd buy it! The Palm Sugar Ribs were really good too. Tender, sweet, and a little sticky. I had to save them for another meal though. I totally over ordered. Dude, can I give you hug? I eat out a lot and it takes a lot for me to get this worked up. I'll be back and I'll be ordering the Khao Soi!",

I can't believe I haven't written a review yet for one of my favorite locations in all of St. Louis: Ted Drewes Frozen Custard!\n\nAll I can do is echo some of the other reviewers:\n\n1. The \"All Shook Up\" concrete is the best (it's banana and Reese's cup).  Heath or Hawaiian-flavored concretes are also great.\n\n2. This place sells CHRISTMAS TREES in December.  Great service and great value (except for the whoppingly-expensive 'Dottie Trees').\n\n3. Ted's is closed from about January 15 - February 15.\n\n4. Avoid it here after Cardinals games!  Alternatively, come after Cards games for the real experience!\n\n5. They sell gift cards!\n\n6. They close when they're out of customers, more or less.  We showed up at 12:15a the other night and barely made it in, to give you an idea.\n\n7. Don't be fazed by long lines.

Both the indoor and outdoor decor is deliberate and thoughtful in its play on a classic Italian eating place. The outdoor sunroof and flowers were especially pleasing to the eye. \n\nWe started with the wild mushroom arancini, which was placed in a truffle oil base. This was by far our favorite dish of the night. The outsides were perfectly crisp and firm, while the inside was decadently gooey and cheesy. The bright sharp cheese with the mushrooms paired extremely well with the savory pervasive flavor of the truffle oil. \n\nThe spaghetti and meatballs were sadly a miss for me- the meatballs had a strong taste ofblack licorice and the tomato sauce was extremely tangy. We had to specially request grated cheese, which mildly improved the dish. \n\nThe gnocchi unfortunately followed suit. The truffle oil strong armed all the vegetables and gnocchi pieces into unwanted submission. \n\nOverall, even though the decor is highly appealing, our food was slightly disappointing as a whole.",

I had the Shahi Kofta while the wife had the chicken Biryani.  Both were well made and quite delicious.  Both were spiced to \"medium\", which was adequate for a lunch.  Quite spicy but not over the top by any means.  Truly a delicious option if looking for some Indian food near campus.  \nDecor certainly felt Indian more than like an American restaurant that serves Indian.  By this I mean it felt like somewhere you might find along a street in Delhi (think how a pizza parlor in NYC feels if you know what I mean).  Ballywood on the tv, little booths done in a decidedly fun way, ... .  Still, it appeared that most of the customers came to order and pickup.  Glad I spent the time eating there, watching the wonderful tv show.  Just fun!\nThe only real downside, and frankly, it didn't bother me in the slightest, was that it took a bit of time for the food to come out.  Whatever, I'm willing to wait if the food is excellent.  And excellent it was!",

Since it was V-Day, we had been wandering for a while and just wanted to find somewhere with a seat and a decent happy hour. After using Yelp and a variety of happy hour apps to no avail (damn you, Valentine's Day!), we were waiting for a stoplight and I happened to look to my right and saw this bar's sign. I convinced the boyfriend to go in because I had recent;y heard about this place, and we were encouraged by the half off happy hour that continued until 7 PM. To be honest, I wish that we could have stayed longer.\n\nI loved the atmosphere inside the bar. It was completely nautical-themed, with sailcloth panels in the ceiling and dark wood reminiscent of the deck of a ship. We even had to climb up a small set of steep steps, which made me feel even more like I was on a ship. The bartender was friendly and joked around with us while he checked our IDs-- a little friendliness goes a long way-- and he proved to be helpful in specifying what was included in the happy hour (i.e., what wine was on special). In addition to the bartender being friendly, I also felt at home with the clientele (who were all a little older than I). A news show was on and the sound was muted, so I asked the couple next to us what was going on and that morphed into a pleasant conversation for a few minutes.\n\nAfter the friendly and inviting welcome of what could be a forbidding establishment, I am excited to return to Misconduct at some point, perhaps to try some of the food (which looked really tasty). Plus, the bathrooms are quite nice (private rooms and an ample amount of them); it's hard to find good bar bathrooms.",

The bus ride was amusing because the driver sounded like Chris Rock and would narrate where we would drive through- swamp areas, hunting places, marshes, a bridge on the hwy that led to nowhere, abandoned communities, and an empty Six Flags affected by Katrina- this was the sad part of our trip. Once we got to the Cajun Encounters location we paid for our tour (it's $50 so be prepared to spend $$$ to see a swamp) and waited for our color wrist band to be called out. \n\nThe tour itself is serene, relaxing, and a totally different part of New Orleans than the French Quarter. You'll see lots of trees, turtles, a few gators, and we saw a family of raccoons. They take you to the open parts of the river with houses lining the shore, some were destroyed from Katrina and left in dilapidated conditions...another sad part of the trip. They also lead you into the narrow parts of the swamp where you can reach out and touch the trees (amazing!!). Our tour guide was super friendly and funny. The best part of this tour was to see how friendly the people were and how high their spirits were even though something as devastating as Katrina affected them all. If you're not into nature, though, I don't recommend this tour for you. It's a whole lot of talking, trees, swamp, and some animals.",

There's ZERO ventilation, so you see clouds (thick haze and a strong aroma) when you enter the restaurant  and can glide on their floor - in rubber soles! It felt more toxic than the days of dining in a restaurant filled with cigarette smoke if you're a non-smoker. I asked a worker (and so did others if they burned something). We were told it's a known vent issue. In the 5-6 minutes that I waited for my order, my eyes watered and I left smelling like I had a shift as a member of the kitchen staff. To make matters worse, there are no windows to open nor fans in the dining areas. IMO, it's was also odd that there's a lockbox on the front door of the restaurant. Another first. \n\nAs for the food, I ordered a smoke burger (the air quality fit its name) , fries and a cran citrus punch.  All 5/5 with the cran citrus punch being a tart lovers dream. They seriously struck gold with that one. The crinkle fries were hot, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The chopped cherry peppers on the burger made for a great combination. I'd definitely order them all again. \n\nIn sum, delicious offerings - strong fry & juice game, reasonable pricing and great service, Poor ventilation. It's only a matter of time before the health department shuts this location down or someone sues them over it. They've likely gotten away with it attached to the only upscale shopping mall (Louis Vuitton, Sak's Fifth, etc) in Nola because their entrance is separate, meaning you cannot enter from the mall. All I want for the city's Shake Shack location in 2022 is clean air so I can actually dine in!",

I appreciated the unique po boys they offered since every other restaurant in the area seems to only have fried seafood versions. Who would've thought I'd end up having one that had pork belly in it! I highly recommend it if you're a fan of pork belly. The cabbage slaw in the po boy goes well with it too.\n\nThis particular location is a bit odd since it's located in the back of a bar (Erin Rose) so you probably have to be 21+. It's also very small so there's not much seating. However, they've recently opened another location in the French Quarter that is a standalone spot so you may want to go there if you plan to dine-in (or if you're not 21 yet lol). Overall, I enjoyed their creative takes on po boys and would return if I'm ever in New Orleans again.",

I've been wanting to try the pizzas here as I've seen so many great reviews and they were also recently mentioned as one of the top ranking pizza spots in the country. Their online ordering system was easy to navigate and I pulled up for the best curbside pick up experience I've had yet. On time, friendly, and they were very welcoming and grateful for my business. And the pizzas were literally brought to my window! \n\nNow on to the food... we ordered two pizzas, a house salad and a giant cookie. The pizzas were much larger and more filling than I expected - a welcomed surprise. The pies are really adequate for 2 hungry people - maybe even 3 if you want a lighter meal. The crust is pretty darn delicious. A dense but chewy center and a wonderfully light and crisp but still chewy in the best ways crust. Pretty much pizza perfection. We went with a classic pepperoni to try them on for size and the cherry picker which was loaded with fresh cherry tomatoes and burrata cheese. OMG yummm. That cherry picker was so freaking good that I couldn't stop eating it and didn't even get to the pepperoni! I added some of my own Calabrian chili's which in my opinion made it even that much more delicious (note to the restaurant: I seriously recommend making that a topping option for this pizza). The salad was also fantastic! And the citrus vinaigrette was some kind of wonderful voodoo sauce. My only gripe was that the bacon i added to the salad was less cooked than I prefer. \n\nOverall this was an excellent meal and we have leftovers for lunch tomorrow. Fully worth the gluten binge! The price is high but the ingredients are top notch and the pizza is truly artisan. Enjoy!",

They certainly didn't get that impression from Little Nona.\n\nI guess it was a slow night because the restaurant was nearly empty when we ate here.  The ratio of customers to staff was nearly one to one.  Still, we had to ask for water refills four times throughout the meal.  They never brought an appetizer.  They never brought crab utensils for three of us who ordered crabs.  Entrees arrived 15 minutes apart.  We had to interact with five different waitstaff because nobody ever stopped by more than once to wait on us.  It was really hard to have conversation and a relaxed dining experience when you are constantly in need of something and nobody is waiting on you to help.\n\nThe food was good, particularly the ripe heirloom tomatoes, but not good enough to redeem itself from the horrible service.  They eventually brought the appetizer during our meal and comped us for it as they knew they were really not keeping it together.  A free late appetizer was not enough to make up for the debacle of this meal.",

If you arrive after 8, you might not be so lucky.\n\nTo start, we shared the fried green tomatoes.  I found the lemon dressing a little overpowering, and the ham wasn't crispy.  \n\nFor our entrees, my husband had the pork two ways.  He thought it was pretty good, although he had a hard time finding the pork belly in the hash.  I had the fried chicken.  They serve a half a chicken for $13.  What a deal!  The french fries were light and crispy.  The hush puppies were a tad dry.  The chicken was fragrant, piping hot, and perfectly crispy without being oily.  It was served with honey mustard, but the staff also offered ketchup, and then Mrs. Moran suggested pepper vinegar, which she brought out herself.\n\nThey make their own ice cream, and it is fantastic.  Also, if you have reason to try their basil chantilly cream, do yourself the favor.  \n\nThe wine list is very moderately priced and very decent for this kind of restaurant. The beer list is great.\n\nAll in all, this is a great place, and I'm glad that it's in my neighborhood.",

But I had an awesome experience here and want to share it.\n\nSave Mart has home-made multi-colored tortilla chips that are just awesome. I love them and buy them quite often. So I walk in and they are out. My daughter told me they were not making them anymore. So I asked and was told they were in the chip aisle (no). I asked someone else and was told they are in the deli (no). I asked someone else who was stocking shelves. She said they were in the deli. I told her that I couldn't find them there.\n\nThis woman (Meredith) put down what she was doing and went back behind the deli counter and asked the person working about the chips. She said that they were in the kitchen waiting to be bagged, fresh. So Meredith comes to the counter and grabs a hair net and some gloves, and goes back into the kitchen and bags up my three bags of chips, that complete the menu for our Christmas Soiree. \n\nThe Chips are awesome and the service this time was awesome. Many times I have heard that places are \"out\" of things, when they probably are not willing to go the extra mile for the customer.\n\nI always get good service here, but this time was particularly great.

Having lived in St. Louis for 10+ years, I actually haven't been as frequently as you might think, but every time I go, I love it. The custard is absolute silk, probably the best I've ever had, and their sundaes are hard to resist. I usually go with a Fox Treat or a Cardinal Sin - the tart berries in each are awfully good with the vanilla custard. Plus great butterscotch malts, and they actually know to ask if you want it thin enough to drink (handy for yours truly, driving and thus not able to work a spoon).\n\nI've actually been back more frequently as I drive through the city on vacations than I probably did when I was living here...If you're on your way through, especially if you're on I-44, you owe it to yourself to stop.

  "text": "I would give 1200 Chophouse 4.5 actual stars but I rounded up because I'm a \"glass half-full\" type of girl. The restaurant itself is small and therefore can get loud and crammed--not an issue for me but can be for some. \n\nOn my two visits to 1200 Chophouse on a weeknight I have been pleasantly thrilled with the quality of food, the service, as well as the pacing of the meal. 1200 Chophouse is located amongst hotels, stores, and restaurants on Gulf Drive of St. Pete Beach (Intercoastal side). There is a parking lot on the premises with parking around the side and back of the restaurant.\n\n1200 Chophouse is part of the same ownership and management company as Madfish (which I have not visited). It was created out of a renovated 1940s house and features a 1200-degree searing grill. The meat cuts are aged in-house according to their website. \n\nThe restaurant does not accept reservations and opens at 5pm sharp. This was initially an issue for an older (95 year old) dining companion, however if you arrive before or at 5 there will be a table for you despite the others who wait for the restaurant to open. I was shocked on my visits at the size of two (fairly) large parties who were waiting outside prior to the restaurant opening and who got in just after it opened. I have observed that it gets pretty busy even early on and I think that is an indicator that people enjoy the food and, as I have spoken to other diners to confirm, come back. \n\nAn semi-open kitchen allows you so see the chefs and cooks hustling to prepare the food. Because of this it can be a loud so if you are looking to dine with people who prefer a quieter atmosphere (background noise doesn't bother me) you might want to choose to dine elsewhere. They have a great variety of wine and also serve beer for those of the drinking class (no liquor). \n\n1200 Chophouse serves up meat and (limited) seafood and does it well. My suggestion if it's something that intrigues you, order the special of the day. I went that way on my first visit with the veal chop with bacon braised brussel sprouts and I wasn't disappointed. From my experience all cuts of meat have been cooked as asked/preferred. My usual dining companion swears by the ribeye. The Tomahawk ribeye is enormous and a spectacle and leaves a nice bone for you to take to your favorite canine. \n\nYou can customize any steak with an additional preparation/sauce ($4) and each entree comes with a nice salad of mixed greens, cheese, dried cranberries and a nice (opaque) balsamic vinaigrette to start. My experience is that the salad is a bit overdressed and to ask for it on the side. Not a huge salad dressing lover myself, I did enjoy the salad dressing. Fresh bread is brought to the table with a honey butter accompaniment. \n\nOne my most recent my dining companions and I had the bruschetta which was flavorful and fresh tasting. A generous portion and thinly cut bread didn't fill me up enough to not enjoy my main course. \n\nI have also tried the sea bass and I loved the preparation other than the fact I found it to be a bit salty. The only other seafood dish I saw on the menu were mussels as an appetizer so if you are a non-meat eater be conscious of this. \n\nIf you are in the area or want to check out a unique steakhouse then this is your place for a memorable meal. The prices for the entrees can be on the higher end but as the saying goes, \"you get what you pay for\". Give it a try and let me know how you like it. :)",

The wedding was in the Tarpon Springs area and I noticed that this location was toward the direction of Tarpon Springs. I believe that the other location was closer to downtown Tammpa which I would expect to be more crowded. We got there about 12PM or so on a Friday afternoon. The place was fairly empty, but by the time we were leaving, an hour or so later, there were people waiting for tables. We were seated prompted in a booth. The waitress was as nice as could be and thoroughly explained everything to us. We settled on the crabcakes, cider wings, pizza and a flight of beer. The Cider Wings were really good. The pizza was also great as you can see a brick ovn pizza toward the back of the seating area going to work. The crabcakes were a bit disappointing though. I had a flight of beer with 4 ounce pours ranging from $1.50-$2.00 each. I believe My flight was about $7, which included some higher ABV beers. I also noticed that though its a \"brewery\". it is more like a grill vibe so feel free to bring the kids. There were a good variety of people there including children and older folks as well. Food was good, beer selection was great and very reasonable, and the staff was excellent. I would highly recommend this to anyone in the area. I am not sure if they have a Happy Hour, but that might be a bonus incentive to visit.",

There were 2 others tables, not super busy. \n\nWhat I ordered: I started off with the Thai soup and it was amazing! It was a coconut milk-based soup and it had spices with green onion, mushroom, and tofu that balanced it out perfectly. We also got the crab avocado dip with lotus chips. The ingredients were very fresh. Then we got the shrimp starter. (I can't remember the exact name.) It was friend shrimp with crunchy noodles wrapped around the outside served in a spicy buttermilk sauce. It was very good as well! Then we finished it off with the bao dessert. It tasted like a funnel cake with ice cream.l! My favorite thing was the soup, but everything was amazing\n\nThese are rather small portions, but the food is worth it! I would love to go back sometime to try a bao!",

Warning, the parking lot across the street has patrol watching you so don't get a ticket or boot. \nThey only take cash so there are two Chase banks and a drug store across the street for you to get cash out if you don't have any. \n\nI decided to go with a scoop of the Pear & Balsamic Caramel which was a unique taste but I liked it alot. I tried the Earl Tea flavor was good too. \n\nThey let you taste but don't get too feisty with the taste tests. One scoop is plenty for me!",

  "text": "I still remember when I dined at Blue Hill in NYC with my family for my birthday. I had specifically requested that restaurant because it was at the forefront of the whole 'farm-to-table' concept, which was relatively new at the time. It was one of the best meals we had had in NYC, so simple and yet the flavors were remarkable. When I heard about The Farm and Fisherman opening up where Paul used to be, and more importantly that the chef was of Blue Hill fame, I really really REALLY wanted to try them out asap.\n\nI mentioned it only once to my bf, and when my birthday approached he announced that dinner reservations were already taken care of and 'it was a surprise.' I love surprises, but I was a little wary - not that he chose a bad place, but I assumed it wasn't The Farm and Fisherman because my own little sleuthing had turned up zero available reservation times there - until 3 weeks later. Imagine my ecstatic surprise when we arrived there.\n\nThe interior has been transformed since Paul, and the warm, intimate vibe is perfect for the space. It's very small, which is one reason reservations are hard to get, and perhaps a bit close quarters but the food makes you forget about anything else. And since it's BYO, everyone arrives with their drinks and proceeds to enjoy them as much as they do the food.\n\nIt was a tough call, but we started off with their Kirby Cucumber Soup (Buttermilk, sour gherkins, chocolate mint), which was creamy and refreshing, and the Smoked Rainbow Trout (Bacon, pea puree, spicy cress, bachelor's buttons), a dish that we agreed was the best smoked trout we'd ever had (yep, better than Telepan). I'm not a big lamb eater, but my bf really wanted to try the entrée because it was seasonal and I have to say that the Braised Lamb Shoulder (New potatoes, Poblano pepper, merguez), had wonderful complementary tastes that built in flavor with each bite. I personally preferred two 'second courses' for my entrée and ordered the Stuffed Quail (Smoked zucchini, apricots, pistachios) and Poached Jennings Farm Egg (Peas, hazelnuts, patty pan squash, pancetta, morels). The quail was fantastic - it's only half of one, but the apricots it's stuffed add a nice sweet-tart flavor to the game hen. My bf initially questioned my choice with the egg, but one bite shut him up. It's the best dish we ordered, and such a wonderful surprise. The poached egg sits in a semi-stew of fresh peas (seriously, the freshest I've ever had EVER), patty pan squash chunks, morels, roasted hazelnuts and the lingering smokiness of pancetta. It's a party on the plate AND in your mouth - the combination of colors, flavors and textures created an absolutely unforgettable dish. I couldn't have asked for more - and almost couldn't finish it! We had a lot of food, so unfortunately dessert was out of the question, but I really didn't care. It was the best dinner I have had all year, and such a perfect way to celebrate my birthday.",

  "text": "I'm slightly obsessed with Henley. After two experiences I am thrilled to give them full stars!! I'm going to focus most of the review on a standard experience, which was a busy Friday night where we had dinner at the bar. They were booked up but we were able to get two seats and the bartenders were extremely busy and seemed short staffed. But we weren't in a hurry so it didn't impact our experience much. We ordered some cocktails which were delightful; the Long Weekend which was a nice vodka cocktail with prosecco and fancy things I can't describe. It was refreshing and delicious. My BF had the Old Belle which was very delicious and more booze heavy; a very nice cocktail. Not gonna lie we had a bit of a struggle ordering because it was so busy, but we ordered the trailer baby crackers and duck hand pies to start. Both appetizers were delicious, but the crackers were fantastic; pimento cheese, gulf crab, and celery which melded together on your palate in a perfect bite. We were so close to ordering a second helping of them they were so good. For entrees we had the squid ink gemelli and skirt steak. The gemelli had shrimp and was pretty salty, but in a good, \"straight from the sea\" kind of way. The steak was great too and perfectly cooked. We ordered a second round of cocktails and both liked our first ones better. I had the Last Years Crop which was made very well, but it was a mezcal drink which isn't my favorite, but if you are a fan should definitely order it! \nMy other visit was a very special one-of-a-kind experience at Henley going to the Rabbit Hole, which is a private, table of 4 in the kitchen with a specially prepared multi-course chef's tasting menu with the optional drink pairings. It's a unique, memorable experience and worth the cost. It is pricey though, so come for a special occasion or prepared to spend some $$. You should definitely come to Henley for a fantastic meal!!",

  "text": "So I have been here a handful of times in the last couple of years. I normally do not enjoy chain restaurants, but I feel that they do this one well. It is basically roasted chicken Portuguese style, so if you don't like that then you should probably skip it. I have a number of things but generally I go with the 1/4 Chicken (Breast) with two sides. Usually it has been tasty. Once in a while I find that the chicken is pretty skimpy. The sides are really good. I enjoy the potato wedges and the salads. One thing I don't like is the amount they charge for fancier sides - for example, 7 dollars for corn on the cob I think is a little much.  They also have family packs that are similar to the ones you find at KFC, but much fresher and healthier. All and all a good experience.",

Well, you'd be wrong because we did and it was great. \n\nLunch on a Thursday is pretty light so our huge number of strollers didn't get in anyone's way. Especially since it was cool out so we were able to sit outside! They have umbrellas for each of their tables which is great for blocking the sun.\n\nOur server was super courteous about serving eight moms with eight children. We were all over the map with our dietary restrictions, no dairy, soy, eggs, or nuts right here, and it was all handled with grace. To be on the safe side I got hummus with just vegetables. They just didn't add the soybean oil which normally goes on top.\n\nThe hummus was good, nothing fantastic, but it is hummus so I'm not going to judge a place mainly for the hummus. This update is to add that this is a super family friendly place during the day. \n\nHonestly, once my baby is older and I can eat and drink with abandon, this is going to be our new go to place.",

  "text": "This was the most bizarre delivery experience I had ever had.  They forgot to add tax and the guy refused to use a calculator and did it in his head, which is fine - but I also like to see my charges on a receipt which they do not provide.  I felt like he snapped at me when I offered to use my phone calculator.  \n\nThe chicken strips were pretty good.  The sauces were mediocre.  I couldn't taste the lime in the chipotle lime may and the curry was also just all right.  I really cannot describe them, but I wasn't crazy about them.  It's not really worth the 50 cents each.  That was another thing I didn't like about it - having to pay 50 cents per sauce. Usually the first is gratis.  However,  you do have to use sauce with their chicken in my opinion.  Otherwise it would be absolutely tasteless. There does not seem to be any seasoning in the breading.  However, the chicken is very very tender,  so I DID like that part.   The mascarpone mac and cheese was also ok.  You wouldn't be missing out. \n\nThe first not so great impression I had about this place was when I first called in to ask what their deliver fee was.  She says \"it' $2.. it says it online.\"  For some reason the latter portion of that statement pinched a nerve because of it's implications and the tone.  I saw their information on this ad they dispensed at dorms, and nowhere on that ad did it say 1)  you have to make the delivery order on-line and 2) there is a $2 fee so no need to get catty over it.  Next time, write that fee on your flyers before you start abrasively flapping your lips.",

Each of their signature rolls is at least $10 and we had ordered their special roll, \"Valentine Roll\", which was $15.50.  The size of the rolls are average and to be quite honest both the rolls we ordered tasted very similar.\n\nThe service was awkwardly out of place as we had a Caucasian male serving us with a Brooklyn accent and very macho-like attitude.  Definitely belonged in a Tony Roma's or something.  He was a little annoying and didn't seem to listen very well.  \n\nBesides that, we all had a good time and would come back if ever in the area again.  The atmosphere is average, food was a little above average, and the service...well, I think we were just unlucky although he was attentive.  Overall, the waves were choppy but definitely not worthy enough to be categorized as a \"tsunami\"",

  "text": "We went here for a professional lunch a while back. Smokin Thighs delivers on one specialty, and it does it extremely well--bbq chicken any way you like it. We actually had a toy dump truck full of wings for each table. That's right: not a bowl, not a tray, not a plate but a dump truck. The wings were absolutely delectable and fittingly served as the seasonings were a bit of a grab-bag combo: jalapeños, onions, tomatos, cheese sauce, bbq sauce, and more. They were rich, just a bit spicy, and finger-lickin' good. Of the other chicken items that were ordered, I really enjoyed the buffalo chicken dip. Just the right amount of heat followed by a sour tang which marries well with tortilla chips. All of the offerings were delicious, but I imagine ordering just one would satisfying my bbq chicken cravings for at least a week. Heavy, honest-to-goodness bbq.\n\nThe bartenders are attentive, kind, and easily some of the best in town. I had absolutely no negative experiences with any of the staff here, and they were all so accommodating to our large party taking up nearly half of their restaurant. Drinks and food were delivered in a timely matter, and no one complained of any thirst or hunger for the hours we frequented the location. \n\nMy only complaint would be parking. Try to avoid rush hours to this location as the lot is a bit small. You can always park across the busy street, but it's difficult to find a crosswalk nearby to make your way back to the restaurant. \n\nIndulge in the delicious chicken and order a drink from the lovely staff. Smokin' Thighs puts the happy back into hour.",

After soon research on simple lunch sandwiches on a weekday, I just ended up walking around on 2nd street and checking out menus on my way, until I found that Bourbon & Branch has vegan cheese options, a weekday brunch menu, and so many options! I only tried two of them today: The cheesesteak and the chicken parmesan (and a side biscuit). \n\nWow! The peppers/onions and vegan cheese on the cheesesteak made it one of the best dairy-free options I've had in the city, and the chicken parmesan was perfectly crusted with great sauce and a fresh side salad, just added a bit of salt. Price is not the cheapest, but relatively okay for the size of sandwich and quality. Since it's weekend lunch and a lil slow, the initial service to put in our orders wasn't the quickest, but the bartender walked over when he saw we were ready for a few minutes and made sure we were eating quickly. Looking at the mixed reviews, can't wait to come back and update on the vegan mac n cheese and the brunch menu as well!",

I went for the standard $19 spaghetti and meatballs. Huge serving, and I could only attempt to finish half, only because I wanted to also have some dessert. And mama, those were some monstrous meatballs, with a cheesy interior.

The ladies that work the place get you into a table, set up the area and everything else for you and all there's left is to get up and grab platefuls of glorious ban chan, meats and seafood. \n\nThe food is so freaking delicious...I'm not sure how many plates I ate but I know I couldn't stop going back for more.

I actually loved the onion bhaji for an inexpensive and slightly guilty app (they are fried) and the chicken tikka masala was very good but contained only 7-8 pieces of chicken. For the price, it's still a good deal and I'll likely choose Tiffin next time I'm craving Indian food at home.",

We had to find/flag down a server. \n\nOrdered the fried wonton creamcheese/crab appetizer (can't remember what they called it) it was DELICIOUS. It was topped off with a fresh jalapeño relish/jam thing, It was the perfect combination of creamy/ crab/ sweet/ spicy/ crispy/ sour. I day dream about this dish. \n\nAlso got the generals chicken, the ribs and the fried rice of the day, which was confetti. Egg, shrimp, and Chinese sausage. \n\nYou know a good Chinese fusion restaurant when they add a pound of cilantro on top for garnish. 5 stars just for that.\n\nThe generals chicken is a HALF CHICKEN, sectioned and fried and then tossed in a sweet and citrusy sauce. Delicious! \n\nThe ribs were amazing. The meat was literally falling off the bone just as we picked it up from the plate! Served with plain white bread and pickled cucumbers. A definite must.\n\nThe fried rice was delicious. I LOVE Chinese sausage. And it's rare to see it in Chinese restaurant. The egg was scrambled and kinda tossed into the rice which was nice and the shrimp were very fresh. \n\nHonestly, with people complaining about it not being authentic. It's a fusion restaurant, accept it for what it is, don't try to compare it because you won't find anything quiet like it and that's what is special about it.",

I think the layout is a little inconvenient since you have to walk through a narrow \"hallway\" that's partitioned off from their dining room before you get to the order counter. And since you can't see the menu until you actually get to the counter, I always feel like I'm holding up the line - Cosi, please put a menu board in the entrance \"hallway\" so that we can look and decide while we are waiting in line.\n\nOther than that, the restaurant is clean and service is fast. Prices are a little high but already expected for this chain. The food is good though so I can't even complain about the price. I recently tried their pork belly Bnh Mi and it's absolutely delicious! I've had many Bnh Mi's in my days, so i feel I can make a fair assessment on theirs. Although it's not served on the traditional French bread, the taste inside is all there...from the spicy raw jalapeños to the tangy pickled carrots and cabbage, the whole thing works and totally mimics the profile of the traditional Viet sandwich I love. \n\nOverall this place is a \"go\" and \"repeat\" for me.",

  "text": "On the beach but not a beach bar. \n\nThey have two full bars, billiards, games and cute girls in bikinis. The inside bar has a unique moat flowing through it. The back doors open up for scenic views of the sunset over the water. The sand is right outside. I enjoyed my first visit until I went out back and saw the patio. It looked like a compound! Locked gates with a door bell, rules signs plastered all over the inside and outside of an ugly fence. It was such a buzzkill. Before I could kick back and admire the beach with my cold cider, I was faced with;\n\n\"Patrons only\"\n\"Private property\"\n\"Private beach\" \n\"No alcohol\" \n\nI wasn't allowed to drink on their private beach property, which didn't make sense for a beach bar. Seems like they want you to look but not touch the beach. So many rules were against bringing beach items. No backpacks, beach bags, knapsacks, thermoses, containers or coolers. Do they honestly expect customers to carry handbags while wearing a bathing suit? I had a backpack with me, which I used to carry the clothes I took off. Call me crazy but I drove there fully clothed. The rule \"management has the right to search any and all bags,\" seemed a bit invasive coming from a place that demanded such privacy. \n\nNo fighting or gambling rules made sense but \"no angry or racist music\" and \"management has the right to skip songs without refund,\" seemed unnecessary. Perhaps they should axe the jukebox full of offensive music options. How they lack control over their own music selection in 2017 is beyond me. \n\nThen the rules got personal... \"No sagging pants or hats worn sideways.\" That doesn't seem racist at all. Oh, and \"men must wear shirts after sunset.\" That doesn't seem sexist at all. I guess they're okay with women being topless as long as their hats are facing the right direction.\n\nThe funniest rule besides \"no foul language,\" is \"no attitude.\" You are forbidden to have a stance of any kind. Ha!!! Just take it to Yelp, my friends. \n\nIn reality this business contradicts the image they portray online with promo photos. Facebook page shows beach volley ball court and girls having fun in the sand with liquor bottles, beers, ice buckets, and beach umbrellas. \n\nThree stars for a really nice day despite the jail vibe and sign pollution. The bartender was a sweetheart and made my friends and I great drinks. Most of the reviews this year are 1 star and pretty appalling. The owner should seriously reconsider what he/she really wants. There are smarter and sexier ways to be exclusive.",

It's not a very large venue, but does have indoor seating, an outdoor patio and a bar. Full liquor at that. Bloody Mary menu on the weekend too. \n\nThe food was outstanding! Everything you expect when you read the menu. They give you a big basket of homemade chips and dip as a complimentary appetizer and they refill upon request. Hot chips and tasty sauce? Yes please! I ordered the Midwest BLT (Food Network specialty) and had a side of Jalapeno Mac and Cheese. MMMMMMMMM so tasty!! I couldn't finish it. So much food! My friends had the burger and pasta. No complaints. All were amazing! The drinks were also on par. I started with a Blueberry Mule ($6) which was perfect and then 2-4-1 well rum and diet cokes.

Now with the expansion to this new location, it's still busy. The new restaurant is beautiful/you can see the bridge crossing NJ, but I miss the intimate charm of the old location. \n\nRecommendation: You must must share the small plates and make that as your meal.\n\nPros:\n1) Service. The waiter was extremely attentive -especially when my friend had a nut allergy.\n2) Dips of the day with grilled pita. OMG- yes. But I didn't love the sardine spread as must as I just like the others\n3) Octopus with giant beans. This is exactly what it is on the Menu. I LOVED THIS. Octopus is very hard not to come out chewy. The flavors was wonderful and I wanted more\n4) Bureta filled with feta, honey, and a wonderful beet salad\n5) Dessert- DO NOT COME HERE and not GET DESSERT!!! Galaktoboureko- This is a honey/type filo pastry. I mean- yes, yes, yes. \n\nCons:\n1) Lamb dumplings - not spicy but there was something off with the pairing of the meal. \n2) Cyprus tortellni - worst thing of the night. It was just heavy and the pasta was just too thick/chewy.\n3) It is very cold by the corner windows/drafty. It was sooo cold they even had mini-heaters in this brand new beautiful restaurant!  \n\nThis is the deal. Come and make a reservations b/c this place gets busy!",

The beer selection is decent, although a friend of mine who is a long time fan of the brewery did warn me that the beer selection is both pared down and significantly more expensive than at the Ardmore location.

One of my favorite flavors this summer was blackberry with cornbread in it. The flavors rotate with the seasons! The staff is very friendly and patient and will let you try lots of samples. There is usually abundant seating inside but with COVID it's take and go (and wear a mask!!).",

  "text": "The style of food here is pretty much a regular old Midwest-Mexican joint ala El Maguey and others like that.  Nothing fancey going on, but we've been four times now and I'd say their quality is consistently good.  Nothing that will blow you away, but so far of the 10-12 dishes we've been served they've all been very good, which I can't say for any of the other similar Mexican joints in the St. Louis suburbs.  Here's my favorite part, though:   They have a $5.99 lunch special that is good on weekends and it includes all their fajitas!  That's a pretty amazing value.  Yesterday, I got the shrimp fajitas and my wife got the Pachanga fajitas - steak, chicken and shrimp.  Both were just $5.99.  I almost feel like I have to hurry up and pay the bill before they come to their senses.  If you're not super hungry, two people could easily split one of these.  I can't do it, though...I'd feel too guilty.   \n\nServers here are always very friendly and seem to enjoy life a little more than your typical bunch of restaurant employees.  \n\nBottom line:  for a Midwest_Mexican place, this is as good as it gets, so 5 stars.\n\nBy the way, it's not \"Off Arnold\" it's \"of Arnold\"",

  "text": "Easter Brunch at Cavan was outstanding!\n\nTruly one of the best sots to eat in Nola while enjoying a historic setting, once a home converted to restaurant, two floors with bars in each.  \n\nOn their website you can read all about the home history.\n\nThe Chef and the staff are top notch here.\n\nWe started with Rose sangria, coffee and the crawfish &goat cheese bread...so so delicious.\n\nMain course we had the flat iron steak with eggs and adobe bbq shrimp and grits.  All was just perfect.\n\nCavan is one of our favorite spots in Nola.  Eating here is a treat.",

  "text": "My boyfriend and I went here after a museum day and penitatary day. We were starved. Usually you'd expect restaurants nearby tourist traps to be mediocre but we were wrong. The food was amazing. The staff were friendly and prompt , the prices weren't cheap but not bad for the quality.\n\nWe had the SW Flatbread, the crab cakes (freaking awesome) and he had the salmon (also freaking awesome). We had the custard for dessert which almost tasted like cheesecake.\n\nI was truly impressed.  I'd come back in a heartbeat.",

  "text": "After visiting for brunch this past weekend, it's really challenging to give Fare any less than 5 stars.  Fare is an upscale restaurant in the Fairmount district of Philly, just across from the Eastern State Penitentiary (which is a museum from a former jail that was closed in the early 70s). After learning that Fare closed at 3pm for brunch, we rushed over to see if they would still seat us about 2:50pm - there was no one else in the restaurant at the time (they close from 3-4:30pm to switch and prepare the kitchen from brunch to dinner service).  \n\nWith smiles, they welcomed us as long as we agreed to order somewhat quickly. That was only the beginning.  \n\nOur server, Danielle, truly exceeded our expectations.  She offered exceptional service, while not being overly attentive.  The appetizers and food we ordered were amazing (from the Pikilia of Spreads starter, to the Gyro Platter, the Eggs Benedict, and both the Mixed Greens and Greek Salads with Chicken (and mediterranean spices)). Even the cocktails were delicious and on point.  \n\nWhen one of us couldn't finish our meal, the restaurant offered to hold on to our to-go bag so we could pick it up after we visited the Penitentiary across the street.  \n\nFare really has it together and I would definitely return anytime I'm in Philly.",

  "text": "I had lunch with my mom on Saturday Feb. 20th there were only a few people inside, and I had to hit the bell near the cash register. Going into the restaurant there aren't stairs, sidewalk with a curve, and if I'm not mistaken a small lower ramp for assistance. The Server name Cruz was handling business from being the Hostess, the Server, made the food, made the drinks, and he was also cleaning up the place. Talk about Superman doing all that work, Cruz was in good spirits, and helpful on the menu. The prices are very affordable, and you can dine in, or do carryout. Social distance was in place, there was hand sanitizer in the front, Cruz did wear a mask, and customers did wear their masks in the restaurant. My lunch I ordered two soft tacos on a corn tortilla I only had ground beef, shredded white cheese, and sour cream. My mom had two soft tacos with everything on hers. Her tacos were delicious & my mine wasn't too bad. I absolutely love the vibrant colorful Mexican artwork. Plus, near the cash register in the bar area there's a pool table which I saw one person shooting pool. Overall, not a bad place to checkout especially if you're in the area.",

But a local recommended we try Drago's.  \n\nUnreal.  \n\nThe charbroiled oysters come out hot, with a crust on them that's cheesy, garlicly heaven.  Use the bread to soak up the sauce.  It's honestly one of the best things I've ever tasted.  If I ever come back, this is the first place I'm going.  \n\nUnbelievably delicious.",

Amazing menu with multiple options. And they have a plethora of Dessert options!! I ordered the crab bake Benedict and it was delish! Basically all Crab and barely any breading!! You can see the chucks of real crab meat. Loved it! My dad ordered the waffle and it just melts in your mouth, so soft and fluffy. My mom got a slice of cheese cake, so moist and all cheesecake, no crust. Made with real strawberries you can see. They have small ones you can order to take home. Overall very warm and homey place. You can see regulars and first timers and everyone is smiling. You will definitely be pleased",

  "text": "In all honesty, nothing that I say here will do anything except add to the truth we already know: this is one of the most fabulous eating establishments in all of Philadelphia. \n\nI came here with my parents and a couple of friends. None of us had the slightest idea about what to order. No problem. The lone man at the counter asked us what meat we preferred, the level of spice we were looking to try, and if there were any sauces we were opposed to. The answers to those three questions produced, for each of us, a magical and absolutely exquisite combination that stunned the group into happy silence. \n\nThe lassi is also phenomenal. We each tried a different flavor--all amazing! Instead of tossing the leftovers, the man at the counter gave us all of the extras in smaller cups so we could sample them from each other. \n\nIf you are anywhere near this place (as in, somewhere within the city limits of Philadelphia) you MUST try the food here. It will be a simple and unforgettable dining experience.",
