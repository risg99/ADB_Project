  "text": "I really want to love this place, but they make it so hard. The past three times in a row I've been there, there has been some sort of ridiculous customer service issue that left me and whoever I was with super annoyed.\n\nStarting with the good: the coffee is delicious. The assortment of baked goods is great...quiche is yummy, etc. I've always loved the space...good mixture of comfy couches and real seating where people can sit and work on laptops. Plenty of outdoor seating on nice days.\n\nThe prices are...steep. BUT I always feel good about supporting a local small business, so whatever. My real problem is the 'tude and just general lack of professionalism that I've seen from the baristas. They clearly know their coffee, and that's great, but here are some of the more ridiculous things that have happened to me there in the past month:\n\n--purchased coffee with my mom and went to add our cream and sugar. My mom realized the half and half container was empty and gave the guy behind the counter a head's up. His answer: \"Yeah, we're actually out of half and half.\" Everyone stared blankly at him, including the other people in line. Now mind you, it was before noon, not five minutes before they closed. No apology, no \"I'm so sorry, we sent someone down the street to the 7-11 (literally down the street) to pick some up, they should be back any minute.\" That was it. The guy behind us asked, \"is anyone going to get some more?\" and the kid literally shrugged his shoulders and turned his back to us. Ummmmmm. As my mom said, when you charge people $8 for two coffees (one of which was just a drip coffee), I don't think it's too much to ask that you provide HALF AND HALF AT YOUR COFFEE SHOP. \n\n--another time I was there, a friend asked for her coffee extra hot, and then when it arrived just warm, she asked if they could nuke it in the microwave for a minute. She was very nice about it. The girl behind the counter, on the other hand, felt it necessary to explain in a condescending tone for five minutes that they \"actually can't put the coffee cups in the microwave\" for some reason I now forget, and then reluctantly offered to add some hot water. Uhhhh. Homegirl. Could you maybe just take the coffee and solve the problem? Put it in a to go cup and microwave it? This doesn't seem like THAT hard of a problem to solve, nor can I imagine it's the first time someone has asked for their coffee extra hot. Again, everyone in line sort of looked at each other helplessly as this happened. \n\n--this is a small thing, but they have multiple sizes for every drink on their board, but then half of them apparently only come in one size? I know it's a small issue, but you'd think it would occur to someone to change the menu so they don't have to keep telling people (last time I was there it happened to both me and the woman behind me). \n\nJersey Java owners, please give your baristas some basic lessons in customer service. Again, they know their coffee, and they're generally nice until there's ANY sort of minor hiccup, and then all basic common sense goes right out the window. Your coffee is too expensive for me to have some ordeal every time I go there. Oh, and buy more half and half.",

  "text": "There are restaurants with views and then there are views with restaurants. This belongs to the latter group. Had I known there was a view involved I would not have booked a table as the food is so often an afterthought and overpriced; this was no exception. The cooking was erratic, ranging from superb to amateurish. Fennel appetizer was sensational. Short ribs were dry and stringy and served tepid. The skate was perfect but the fettuccine lackluster. The light over our table was burned out so we ate in partial darkness which only served to highlight the short comings of the dishes. Loved the bread selection at the start and the shortbread cookies and jellies at the end were great! It's a good place for drinks and bar snacks and it feels special. If you care about the food, go elsewhere.",

  "text": "My husband and I were looking for a late lunch and wisely decided on 312. We were seated around 2 pm, and the restaurant was pleasantly busy. Our server was friendly and informative with the standard \"it takes 45 mins for a deep dish pizza\" warning. \n\nWe ordered 312s and an order of mozzarella sticks to start. The beer was a little warmer than I like, but the mozzarella sticks were perfection. Crispy and hot with melty, gooey cheese. Yum. \n\nOur pizza was well worth the wait. The deep dish \"Stockyard Patty\" came with a buttery crust, slightly sweet sauce, and a perfect disc of sausage. Our pizza was piping hot and drool-worthy. Definitely reminiscent of Lou Malnati's or Gino's East deep dish pies in Chicago. We will be back for sure!",

We had a bunch of furniture that needed to be assembled as well as piles of boxes that needed to be unpacked and dealt with.\n\nThey did a great job.  One thing that I really liked about working with Wendy is that she is very responsive in her communications.  I contacted her via email and she replied the same day and in all of our back-forth emails and phone calls, I never had a communications issue with her.  I point this out because too often, service providers, who are great with their services, are not great with their communications.  Wendy and Corey were prompt, efficient, and super friendly.  I would definitely use them again and I absolutely recommend their services.",

  "text": "To be succinct, I'm just not a fan.\n\nIndoor swimming pools usually give me a bad headache, but the intense headache and nausea I feel here has so far been unrivaled. 84 degrees year round? Let's try closer to 98 degrees. Once you add in all those hyperactive kids with their insanely high metabolisms packed into the small space, the heat problem gets really out of control. They do offer alcohol for the adult crowd, but I don't see how anyone could get through a drink without upchucking.\n\nEven in the winter this place is always crowded. I wouldn't really suggest going in winter, and not just because swimming doesn't sound appealing in the winter. When the outdoor section is closed off, indoors it's slim pickings for attractions. This really is quite a small water park. As far as cleanliness is concerned, it certainly could be worse. However, I feel like the water is always a bit dingy here. You will need a shower ASAP after leaving.\n\nIf you're really hard up for entertainment, then you could always come here with small kids and they'll have a blast. That being said, there's far better water parks out there to choose from.",

The restaurant felt more like a sports bar with all the TVs on and the pop music blaring so loud it made it difficult to focus on my date.  I got the Stanford (turkey burger) and zucchini straws.  The straws where much better than my burger that lacked any real taste.  My date got the Going Greek (lamb burger) and loaded potato salad and once again the side was better than the burger.  I've had better burgers for much less.  I will try it again with a more traditional beef burger to see if it was just the non traditional that didn't work for us.",

So, there I sat a few days later, awaiting this highly sought after ground beef wonder.

  "text": "This is for the University (Faculty) Club's dining room, open mainly to members who are part of IUPUI's faculty and staff.  Menu here:\n\nhttps://universityclub.iupui.edu/Reservations/Weekly-Menu\n\nExcellent service; my sponsor took me and other staff visiting the school this summer, for a buffet lunch.  The waitstaff were prompt in filling our waters and inquiring about more plates, and also served us whenever we requested (we asked that 2 portions of the red velvet cake be split 3 ways, and the result was prompt and precise, with extra small plates).  She was cheery and interacted with us professionally, even if this wasn't (I don't think) a private sector job driven by Yelp reviews and employee performance surveys.\n\nThe menu itself feels as if it's trying to demonstrate global culinary awareness on a very limited budget.  A couple of salad-y items including cornbread salad, a lively green (spinach) salad, and 2 other choices, plus various dressings that did not come out of a generic commercial bottle.  A couple of starches then proteins including a savory-sweet tofu entry--it was like the spicy peanut butter tofu I make at home, but more breaded and gunky and thus less spicy; a \"kalbi\" meat thing which was sweet and savory, soy sauce style, and kinda clumpy, but tried to hit the Korean flavor profile; and a couple of other animal meat options (uh, fish?).  Some inventiveness for trying to do something for foodies in this very countrified and simultaneously urban environment, I guess.  Culinary diversity efforts are always appreciated, even if the textures were not excellent.\n\nMy guess is they're operating with limited funding and staff, but there's some smart guy or gal doing the menu design, trying to figure how to make this stuff onthe line in a way that doesn't taste mass produced, but that also doesn't violate their financial dictates.  The food was tasty, not old, and satisfying without being too sweet, oily, or salty.\n\nPretty good job, all said.",

We will be staying at this hotel every time we visit Reno!",

It is not only tiny, but it looks like something that was dropped off the back of a McDonald's truck as it was driving through a bad neighborhood. It was over cooked, dry, and just plain nasty. I was very disappointed to find such a flop in a restaurant that seems to be filled with blockbusters. The overall experience was fine, but that burger sure did ruin it.  The fries were another disappointment all their own.",

I've been there three times since the re-naming and my order has never been right. One time I order over easy eggs and scrambled came out. The next time I ordered corned beef hash and sausage patties came out and the final time I ordered a 2 eggs with corned beef hash and home fries with tortillas. I got eggs with country fried steak and biscuits. By the time my order was replaced everyone at my table had finished there breakfast and had mediocre responses to the quality food. I'm not one to complain at restaurants but I will not be visiting what used to be my favorite neighborhood breakfast joint anymore.",

A brunch place that I don't need to go into the city for or a global chain restaurant.\n\nI have been here for breakfast & lunch (Marlton & Cherry Hill)  and both times I have been here the food has been spot on!! Everyone at our table enjoyed their food!!  The food is fresh, unique & not greasy like some diner food in the area. I recommend the Marsala Eggs Benedict very good & different and the Benedict sauce was tasty just wish the sauce was a little warmer. I like my poached eggs juicy 1 of the eggs was over cooked for me. I would recommend telling them how you like your eggs cooked. Overall a great place for sunday brunch!! Also don't forget the champange for mamosas!!   \n\nThe wait staff is also great!! Very accommodating without the hidden charges!!  They asked if we would like any of our drinks in a to-go cup.\n\nTurning Point I recommend that you serve the Marsala Benedict in the big spoon serving dish like the others benedict dishes that is a great way of keeping the sauce from the potatoes & everything all on one plate",

The very small kitchen has a little trouble keeping up with the demand of the closely-packed tables. Highest praise for the fried green tomatoes and the avocado bowl. The Caesar salad had freshly grilled chicken and thick shavings of parmesan. The oyster po boy was full of outstanding oysters and served on really good bread. There were a couple of disappointments: the coffee tasted as if it had been stewing too long and the pancakes weren't warm when they hit the table, but they were still tasty.

We checked in on a Sunday afternoon, and it was really quick. The rep was knowledgeable and friendly and gave instructions on how to find our room. The room was the cheapest they had, but still really nice, and very clean. We dropped our stuff off and explored. There is so much to see and so much to do. Some of the activies are free, like the fountain show in the evenings, but most aren't, such as the riverboat ride or the spa services. \nDinner our first night was at the Cantina. Prices are decent, and the service was good. Our second night we ate at Piaso (pizza). The pizza was good, for the price. Generous servings for $4. Friendly service and a decent selection of wines. There are at least three coffee houses that I counted, and all serve Starbucks coffee. \nThere are three pools - one indoor and two outdoor. The Cascades Outdoor Pool has already 1.5' small pool that was perfect for our three year old, and the larger pool went up to 4'6\" which was great for our 8 year old. There is a great locker room by the Cascades Indoor Pool that has showers, a hair dryer, and restrooms. \nOverall my family and I had a great time, and I don't regret the money we spent for the two nights we were here (which was a lot). Just do your research, and take the time to see the scenery. It is breathtaking!",

I've been here a few times with them and have never been impressed, but after today felt the need to write about it.\n\nUsually when I order a 7-9 dollar cheesesteak I save half for another time so I don't feel like I'm over-eating. When my chicken cheesesteak was put in front of me today I had to ask the waiter if the cook accidentally used only half the normal portion of meat. I've never seen such an empty steak sandwich in my life and easily housed the whole thing, plus the measly pickle spear and miniature bag of chips. \n\nAfter confronting the waiter he asked me if I wanted another and I told him \"no, not if this is the normal portion size. Do they always look so empty?\" I won't quote the waiter exactly but his reply was along the lines of that's the normal portion size but the chef doesn't know what he's doing and that's why it looks small. \n\nThis was a disgrace of a cheesesteak, and thus worthy of a 2 star review considering all the times I've eaten here in the past have been a solid \"Meh\".",

  "text": "I went to the buffet for a basic breakfast because it was close to the cafes price.  I thought the buffet had good choices (although I didn't try everything and I realize that everyone's favorites might not be there).  I just had bacon, scrambled eggs, hash browns and a cinnamon roll.  Everything was at least satisfactory except the cinnamon roll, which was excellent.  It was the only roll I've found that is comparable to Cinnabon's.  Maybe the roll was a little soft, but that was more than made up for by the flavor.  I knew it would be bad, but I had to go back for seconds.  It took a lot of willpower not to just stay and eat roll after roll, especially since by that point they were effectively free.  I don't know how lunch and supper buffets are, which is why this os only four stars, but the cinnamon rolls are five stars in my book.  And the service was also very good.",

This place is right off of Main St in Edwardsville, IL. This is a grab and go place. Parking lot across the street. The bakery boasts chairs but only in their front window. The owners greet the customers and it is a quick grab and go. Today we tried the cookies, They had four different kinds in the case, and after I got my order and man walked in and asked for the cookies that they were famous for, just my luck they were coming out of the oven. They are a triple(yes triple) chocolate cookie. I selected the Blueberry Almond cookie, it was chocked full of blueberries, I almost did not feel guilty eating it because it had two super foods (blueberry and almonds). We also got the chocolate chip, this was a little crusty, I am sure it would be a good dunking cookie, but I only dunk basketballs not cookies. Finally we got the oatmeal raisin. It was a nice cookie, but I think my recipe is better. The place lives up to its name... Bonus, they do sell coffee to go...No almond milk though.",

I'm used to Mexican foods from the S.F. bay area...This place does not cut the grade...\n\nHey Reno, what's with the small portions? Maybe due to the war we are engaged in that food is being rationed? Or is business that bad? \n\nCold rice, chicken over cooked and dry (both my G/F's & my dish), my enchiladas was cold, red sauce tasted weird. G/F's flour tortilla was browned in cold grease as it didn't really brown, just sucked up the grease. My soda was flat, not enough carbonation to it....was also warm that the ice melted within 5 minutes of taking it to the table, so soda got watered down...\n\nThe candle center piece in the center of the table was glued down so one has to eat to the side of the table...very strange. \n\nI ordered a burrito and it's not Cali style, it's more a style of what you would find in the freezer section of your supermarket. yea on the small child size. Cali burritos are BIG, plentiful and filling. It also sort of tasted like it was re-heated, not freshly made...I would dine there only as a last resort...",

Together with our architect, Finegold + Alexander, a design and concept of both metal and glass was conceived. With guidance from Riggo Design, a metal artist in Chicago, Third Degree engaged Troco Custom Fabricators to jointly create the eternal light.\n\nNone of the parties involved in this project had ever designed an eternal light. We did our research, discussed various concepts and then worked with Doug Auer and Michael Moran for the implementation. We then held our breath as Third Degree and Troco did their work.\n\nThe result is magnificent: A breathtaking sculpture that has our congregation in awe!\n\nThe only thing better than the fixture itself was getting to know Doug and Mike and their genuine hearts - which illuminated everyone in the process.",

I wanted to get acrylics and since they did plain ole acrylics (unlike the 2 other salons I previously went to), I sat down and let the lady go to work. Halfway through she informed me that they would be $60 plus $5 for a french tip, so I might as well just get the gel for $70. For $70, these acrylic nails should be able to give me magical powers. Instead, they are uneven, transparent enough that my nail bed shines through, and cracking 2 days later. It took an hour and a half, they switched girls in the middle of the process and the quality is appalling. I highly suggest going to another nail salon in the area.",

Walk to Starbucks while you wait - or sit at one of their tables or chairs and enjoy their free wifi.

The cherry on top to this awful evening was when i was served lifeless skinned rubber meat on a platter with lettuce and PEANUT SAUCE, what mexican restaurant puts peanut sauce on a salad. I would recommend not going here EVER unless you want slithery chicken weenus sliding down your throat.",

  "text": "I have been to this nail salon a few times over the past 3 mos. Their quality and service is slipping. This is too bad because I go here because it is so close to my work and easy for me to pop in on my way home. \n\nIt is still clean, friendly service, etc. No complaints there. But the quality of service is not as good. They are not as thorough and services have been rushed and sloppy. \n\nOne complaint is there is only one employee who does nails (other than manis) and this is a huge time suck. \n\nAnother is that my last pedi was rushed and not up to par. The woman did not trim the cuticles as well, remove dead skin, pay attention to detail, or do a thorough job. She went very fast and cut corners.\n\nI got a full set, and a pedi. The man did the nails (which were fine/good except for some acrylic on the sides which he fixed later) and then she painted them. The polish job was sloppy. I had bare spots on the edges, lumps (old polish?) and overspill onto the sides and cuticles. She did not follow up with polish remover to clean them up - instead, as she painted, she ran her nail along the edges to remove it. Not quality. \n\nI happen to like nail art once in a while - not every time - but sometimes I splurge. There does not seem to be anyone who does nail art well. There are many designs you can choose from on the hand models/boards but they are not recreated well. I chose one design for my big toes and it looked nothing like what I picked out. On an earlier visit, I had a picture of a design on my phone and was told point blank they couldn't do it - it was not complicated or too fancy. ??? I have witnessed other customers being disappointed in the nail art feature as well. \n\nOverall, I think this place may be understaffed to meet demand and is struggling with consistent quality. They need another person who can do nails really well like the man does and they need to take their time/provide thorough service.",

  "text": "I have been to this location twice and the first time it was much better than last night. Simply, the beer is just ok. I love good beer but I will drink it whether I think it is amazing or awful. I got 4 of their current seasonal beers in a sampler (batch 100, winter warmer, undead black IPA and paramount). They were decent, nothing to write home about or come back the next day for. The reason they lose points from last night was because of the food, not the beer.  Got a black and blue burger. It had just too much blue cheese on the burger and the meat was just alright and they also skimped on the fries. The price is steep for their higher end food but I think their entrees are very good and will stick with those for next time.\n\nP.S. For anyone looking to avoid big parties, babies and young kids (1-12 years old) I have always seen a big group of people who decide to bring their children with them. Kids never bother me but they are kids so they make noise and run around the restaurant. Not much you can do about it besides sitting at the bar.",

The menu was confusing as they have fresh fish on the menu but if it does not have a checkmark beside it they do not currently have it. I wanted halibut but there was no checkmark. So I asked the waitress for a recommendation. She recommended the snapper dish. So I ordered that. Then the server came back to tell me the snapper was still frozen solid. The chef recommended I get the red fish but I did not want that. So I got the swordfish.  It was good but I was disappointed.  The waitress was friendly and took good care of us. I said well get me a discount since you didn't have what I wanted. No discount and no manager came out to apologize for not having dishes ready to go for a Friday lunch. We will probably come back but are disappointed in this trip to one of our favorite restaurants. You would think they would have better customer service and have all menu items prepped for the weekend!",

So much potential but really fell short...here is The Good The Bad and The Ugly.\n\nThe Good- as mention the interior is amazing, makes you want to back and relax all night long. Fish and chips was solid.\n\nThe Bad- Soooo... I have never had to eat a burger with a knife and fork... why did I have to do that you may ask? (See pic) the bun was so dry it crumbled into dust as I held it and took a bite. It was brioche bun that was way dry and appeared to have an egg wash on it which just made matters worse. I will say the burger meat, with bacon and English cheddar if eaten all at the same time was great, though burger meat by itself needed season.  \n\nThe Ugly- the coleslaw straight up had turned, it smelled like rotting vegetables in fishy water and tasted the same. I literally spit it out it was that bad.\n\nI am sadly seeing a food quality issue here, borderline need health inspectors to visit on that coleslaw.\n\nAlso side note if they had more local craft beers other then 2-3 on draft, an extensive bourbon list this would make a killer spot for drinks and drinks only until food quality is resolved. Wishful thinking as well but would be great if this was a cigar bar as the atmosphere is prime for that.\n\nPS- other people bitched about pricing but we felt it was very inexpensive. $51 for 2 meals, 3 drinks.\n\nI really hope they make some of these suggested changes sooo much potential for go to spot.",

Yes, there are lots of stupid human tricks here but the security guys keep it tight and have an eagle eye for anything dangerous or illegal. \n\nNot something I'd do every week, but for the occassional visit to debauchery land, I'll go here.",

If you are in Santa Barbara at all on this week of celebration and you love authentic Mexican food you must come here!  You will love all the great food they offer here and the dancing and music.  There is beer and wine.  I usually come here for a big bowl of pazole for breakfast, but before I do that you must order some tomales.  Get here early for the tamales because the line gets long.  This place is the real deal.  And not to be missed if your a serious foodie. Viva la Fiesta!!!",

For the rice, we had one without butter or eggs, four with butter but no eggs, and one with eggs and butter. As you can see, we were totally annoying. But our server and chef were so accommodating.  Our chef, Tanaka, was great...and the tofu was AMAZING. We also had miso soup, noodles, vegetables, and fried rice. Everything was great except the vegetables, which were pretty bland. We also got a side of mushrooms, which was a waste...not flavorful at all. Portions were big. Service was great!",

I'm not much of a beer drinker but do drink every now and then but this tour was very interesting.  Our guide was very good and threw in some jokes from time to time which mainly was focused on the Chicago Cubs.  \n\nAs for the reviewer mentioning about not bring babies or toddlers, my 3 year old daughter loved the tour, so much was going on around her that she was distracted.  Of course she just had to have a stuff Clydesdale in the gift shop.   Some people are on vacation or trip and don't have a \"sitter\".  \n\nGreat tour, will do this again next time we are in town.",

  "text": "This place is brilliant. If someone were to visit me in St Louis, and ask for me to take them to a place that best captures the essence of St Louis; this place would be it. Located in the heart of South City on Morganford, The Haven is all you can imagine in your quintessential neighborhood bar.  The inside is like a shrine to St Louis traditions. Walls glittered with plaques of the arch and Cardinals greats. Neon beer signs illuminate the hard wood walls; and make you feel like you're at your uncle's basement all over again. Here is a place to get to know the real locals, the real St Louisians who have lived here their whole lives. As I sat here, I observed how everyone knew each other, chiming in here and there about how so and so's daughter is doing, and etc, etc. The wait staff was warm and welcoming, and the bar is a place where you can sit back and be yourself.  I'm happy I discovered this gem, and the visit still sticks with me, because of how it brought me closer to know the city better.  I highly recommend anyone not from here to check this place out.",

I don't the know owners name but he is the nicest guy. Very friendly. The food was delicious but it might have been wise for us to confirm what we thought we were ordering. Indian food is delicious but I am horrible at remembering what I ordered before. Unfortunately this review is another victim of my not being able to remember the names of what we ordered. One dish was mostly spinach (a total hit), another was some red chicken dish (perfectly cooked but looked like it was dyed red), and naan which is everyone's favorite. If you know your Indian dishes you won't be disappointed. Kids are always welcome there. Be sure to enjoy downtown while you're there.",

She even came out with fried cheese cake with a candle and started singing happy birthday at the end!\n\nThe birthday girl had the Bloomingdale Roll $13 which was spicy tuna, spicy salmon, spicy kani, spicy yellowtail and spicy shrimp avocado with longan on top. It was good but I'm not really a fan of the pink seaweed thing. I asked the waitress if they could write \"Happy Birthday\" on her plate and they did. They even added a little tree and made it look like a little island!\n\nMy other friend ordered the Cancer Roll $15 which was spicy tuna, seaweed, salad, eel, masago, soft shell crab. They drew a bird on her plate! It was so cute!\n\nI had the M16 Roll (sounds like a gun) $13 - eel tempura with spicy tuna rolled in black and red tobiko (fish eggs). It was yummy! And they decorated my plate too! I had a little tree as well.\n\nThe service here was great, the sushi was pretty good, the environment was nice and I will be back!",

You walk in and go to the register where you look at the menu, order and pay.  Then you look for a seat.  This can be annoying and not group friendly.  Sometimes you will wait and wait and wait and almost get your food with no where to sit.  It hasnt happened to me but I am a spaz and always think it will.\n\nThe food is great.  Last time I got the jalepeno pork over grits.  It was fantastic and not too spicy.  Very very good.  My lady got the smoked salmon omelet with fried capers and it was really good too.  Very great food and interesting menu with the standard breakfast options as well.\n\nThe owner is moving around the floor the whole time and he is really really nice.  All of the staff is nice.  \n\nMy only real comlaint is that for me the ordering/waiting thing is a little stressful and can sometimes stop you from even enjoying your food lesiurely cuz a million people are standing there looking for the next available table.\n\nGreat food though.",

The strong piped-in artificial floral... citrus... whatever aroma in the hotel lobby, where we were forced to sit due to the large and noisy crowd in the tiny bar, also did not help me enjoy my cocktail one bit.

It's just frustrating I can do my own nails better and paint all the way to the sides without leaving a gap. But toying with an at-home LED lamp is a pain.\n\nSo the nitty gritty: There are little bumps and bubbles. I had to pick clear and colored gel off my skin later and trim where it had pooled in cuticles with nail scissors. Several nails were filed slightly assymetrically. Also they do something called wrapping their tips with a extra layer so it's sealed under and looks kind bulbous on the nail, like thicker visibly and to the touch at the tips. \n\nThat being said the tech was super sweet and genuinely nice.

I went with the tofu lemongrass and I seriously wish there was more sauce. It barely covered my tofu which left me eating unsauced noodles. I tried adding a ton of add-ons to try and get some flavor out of the sauce but no dice. The peanut sauce for the shrimp rolls was super watery and again the shrimp tasted old. The soda chanh was crazy sweet. I still enjoyed it but between that and the food I wavered between over-sugared and over-salted. My manpanion had the pho and he gave it an \"eh\" as well. I will say the prices were pretty awesome but I'm not sure we'll be back. There are other Vietnamese restaurants that I would rather frequent, e.g. Far East. FYI - they are now run by the owners of Miss Saigon and I had that very same dish there. It was sauced well and had much more flavor.",

  "text": "I really liked this place.  I went with a coworker during beer week.  We came from their sister bar Farmer's Cabinet.  Both places are quite similar, but FC had an air of pretentiousness that Boilermaker didn't.  FC was also considerably more expensive for smaller portions whereas Boilermaker's beers and food were reasonably-priced.\n\nTheir beer week offerings featured over a dozen from their brewery, Cabinet Artisinal Brewhouse which are mainly sour and/or really interesting beers.  I absolutely loved everything I tried.  One of the two bartenders was very knowledgeable and all were helpful.  We ordered their hot dog plate which was 2 bacon-wrapped hot dogs with a mountain of fries for $9 which is a pretty good deal IMO.\n\nUnfortunately, I just read that the headbrewer is leaving Cabinet Artisinal Brewhouse.  Hopefully they can get another highly skilled brewer to continue pumping out unique brews (especially my beloved sours) as their beers were a big reason I'd go back to this place.",

Unfortunately though, having the Hotdog-Gods smile upon me in such a way just leaves everything else about this park seem inconsequential in comparison....\n\nThe straight rundown on citizens bank is that it fancies itself a family oriented establishment. Children with giant pretzels runnin' n' a screamin' down the aisles, whole families laughin' n' dancin' and cheerin' while eating icecreams out of mini baseball helmets, all while thoroughly embracing themselves in one gigantic smiling disaster.  Hooray!\n\nPersonally, im used to and feel far more comfortable in an atmosphere more to the likes of Shea or the Bronx where old grizzled men from Queens stamp out their half smoked cigars on newborn babies all while drinking the blood of sacrificed kittens and puppies, howling rabid obscenities, and slugging back pints of canadian club whiskey they snuck in via duct taping the bottle to their inner thigh in the parking lot.      \n\n ....oh well.      \n \nEither way, raising a cannon propelled hotdog to the skies in screaming triumph and tasting its deliciousness soon after will bring  a drunken smile to my face in any ballpark. \n\nCitizens-Bank-Park-DaycareCenter-Hotdog-Paradise forever and ever.",

There were only 3 other tables there when we came in but it filled up throughout the hour & a half we were there. I would suggest making a reservation as there are only about 12 tables total - & it's BYO so bring your own wine. \n\nI forget the actual name of the appetizer we got but it was basically fried risotto with mozzarella & marinara. It came out as 3 decent sized fried balls. They were delicious. I got the filet - which I asked to be cooked medium... it came out more on the medium-well side but it was fine. It's an Italian place... I should have known better :) BUT, the sauce & jumbo lump crab meat & mushrooms on top of the filet was amazing. It was served with sliced potatoes & green beans. My bf got the gnocchi & it was served in a butternut squash sauce... so good. I almost wish I would have gotten the gnocchi because they were pillowy & delicious. I'd definitely come back for those alone. We also got a side of homemade pasta with marinara sauce. It was good but I've had better homemade pasta at some other places. \n\nI have to admit, I expected to be there awhile since all the food is made to order but we were in and out within an hour & a half. We'll definitely be back.",

Not only were we an apparent nuisance to the baristas reviewing Halloween costumes with their (boy)friends, but also were treated with, as one other customer said, much shade.\n\nI brought my own cup in which to have my coffee. However, when I asked if she could put the drink in my cup, I received elevator eyes, a smirk, and a clear, \"No\". Ok, I thought, sometimes sizes are difficult to estimate in a different cup.\n\nThen, as we were sitting down enjoying our coffees, I turned around to look at the counter for WiFi info. I received a stern look from the barista, who then exclaimed \"Can I hep you with something?\", to which I responded, \"oh, I was just looking if you had WiFi.\" The barista responded, \"We have a sign, for you,\" again with a plethora of shade.\n\nWill never return, thanks for trying.",

  "text": "Although I lack the gene that allows a person to get excited about sports, I still love seeing games at this stadium. It is so well designed, there is hardly a bad seat in the house. Even the ones in the pavilion take my breath away. And I love, love, love how the city is framed in the outfield. \n\nThe stadium is located in South Philly, wayyyy down there, away from downtown. It is nice because people can tailgate, which is like a great anthropological discovery for someone from a city whose stadium is right downtown. You can come early? And cook burgers? And drink beer? And you don't have do it at a bar? Fascinating! \n\nI was pleasantly surprised to discover the games feel shorter when you watch them at the stadium. I think this has a lot to do with the fact that the fans are kept entertained, even in the lull between innings. Plus the Phanatic has an effing hot dog bazooka! Come the hell on! But seriously, even if you don't know a thing about baseball, you will not be bored.\n\nThe tickets are relatively cheap for a professional sporting event, although they have become more difficult to obtain since the Phillies won the world series. Prior to this season, I used to be able to get decent seats the same week of the game without using a reseller. This is just what happens when your team kicks some serious ass, I suppose.\n\nThank god they have decent beer here. Seriously. Brewerytown carries Victory on tap and Dogfish Head in bottles. Since Prima Pils is my favorite pilsner, that makes me first a happy lady... then a drunk lady, despite the $7 price tag.\n\nIn addition to real beer, there is real food! There are even vegetarian options other than fries and pretzels. At my last game, I tried a cheesesteak from Tony Luke's. It was bready, but certainly nowhere near the worst I've ever had. Someone caught a ball about 10 seats down from me and THANK GOD the camera did not pull out enough to catch me scarfing that thing down. My dignity is still intact for the moment. \n\nFinally, I have read a few reviews that say Phillies fans are violent assholes, but I have to disagree. Passionate? Definitely. Are there a few bad seeds? Of course, there always are. Believe me, I come from drunken, violent, asshole fan MECCA. If there is anything I am an expert in, it is perhaps this topic. If you have an issue, there are ushers all over the place and it is made clear that they take complaints seriously.",

  "text": "Spot has been on my burger list to try for sometime. Spot burger consistently shows up on numerous best of Philly burger lists. When they opened up shop in Brewery town, I quickly bookmarked Spot and waited for a burger craving to hit me to give it a try.\n\nSpot is on West Girard Ave and I was able to find parking easily and close by on a Sunday night. The space is clean and bright with tables in the front, and back. There is also counter seating. There was some nice use of wood on the walls which gave Spot a cool urban vibe design.\n\nThe people that work at Spot were very friendly and helpful. They explained the specials and helped us with suggestions. I was surprised that Spot has other items such as Fish & Chips and Muscles in addition to burgers, sloppy Joe's, pulled pork and cheese steaks. Mental notes for my next visit.\n\nI went with the Spot burger; which had hickory smoked bacon, cheddar, pickles, coleslaw and Spot sauce. This was a great burger. The bun was excellent, fresh and toasted just right.  The burger was moist and juicy. The bacon was great and the slaw and sauce really made this one darn tasty burger. My daughter had the Santa Fe with Avocado, pepper jack cheese, jalapeño, red onion, sun dried tomatoes and a slightly spicy sauce. This was also a really good tasting burger! Spot really shines with their use unique toppings and sauces. \n\nWe ordered the plain fries too and these were crispy and not greasy. They were very good fries but Sketch still has my favorite fries. We had a couple of Fanta sodas too, which was pretty cool. All of our food came out surprisingly fast.\n\nSpot is very high up on my burger list and very close to Sketch. Spot lived up to the hype and is really cool little place in an up and coming section of the city. I will be back and probably soon. 4 plus Yelps.",

  "text": "First - Dear YELP admins, how could the word \"hoagie\" fail your spell checker? C'Mon already!\n\nEveryone has a favorite steak shop or two and they can be as different as night and day. White House, Tony Luke's, Geno's, Pudge's - like comparing apples and pigs, or Wilt to Magic, or Kung Fu to Karate, you just can't compare iconic examples different styles.\n\nLarry's is like that. I've been coming for 30 years. Once or twice, I even stepped up to the Houseway Belly Filler. I think this was the first place I ever had a meat topping on a steak sandwich (pepperoni), but it wasn't the last. \n\nWhat makes Larry's Larry's? First, the guy is cooking in the window. Next, the steaks are chopped. Not shredded, fluffed, laid out or shingled. Even the toppings on our chicken cheese steak hoagie were chopped - a devout nod to every-bite-the-same sandwich science. A lot of work goes into every steak. Finally, the fresh Amoroso-style roll is just a little toasted, not enough to be a grinder, but certainly not steamed on the grill like an AC sub. \n\nWhen on Hawk Hill and hungry go to Larry's. Is it the best steak ever? Nah, but it is an institution and true to itself. As you take your first bite, envision yourself bustin curfew on the way home from seeing Neil Young at the Spectrum, or watching the Sixers take the NBA crown, or sweating whether Y2k will crash your Palm II. If you twist my arm, Larry's doesn't crack my top 5, but tradition is tradition, and Larry's has stood the test of time for good reason.",

Now.\n\nThe rest of the people I was with raved about the sushi, too, so I'm guessing they loved it.\n\nThe only thing I had to complain about here? The service was kind of weird. We had a reservation (although I really don't think it was necessary) and we waited for a long time before anyone came over to take a drink order. Plus, we had to ask to get water glasses and even then the water didn't come until AFTER they brought our regular drinks out.\n\nThat was kind of strange but I will forgive them because I think I finally found a place where I can go when my husband is craving sushi.",

  "text": "You get what you see--chicken fingers. They also serve wings and other overpriced items like mac and cheese (mediocre) and pastries (meh). \n\nThe sauces are unique and probably the best part about this place as you won't be able to find sauces like this elsewhere. Be watchful of how full the sauce is because some of the containers are not completely full and you get jipped. Sadly you can't sample the sauces without having to buy them. My favorite is bar b q sauce. It has a slight acidic vinegar kick, but isn't bittersweet. Maybe they cut back on the sugar? The chipotle lime mayo is great. It isn't too creamy and oily. The chipotle is subtle, almost dull and a little bit more would make it better and bold. I found myself having to double dunk the chicken in this sauce to really taste it. You always finish it wishing you had a little more. I've tried almost all of them and none of them are too memorable that I can recall anything great or bad about the rest of the sauces.\n\nThe breading is thin and crisp, which I appreciate. With one bite you taste the breading and chicken, and not just breading on heavily breaded chicken that other places might serve. The breading can be over salty and seasoned too much. Don't mistake this for rich and intense. It is salty. I end up drinking a lot of water with this meal partially due to this. What makes the breading suck is that it is not always fresh. Who knows how long the chicken has been sitting out.\n\nThe meat can be hit or miss; the chicken can be a little parched. This is disappointing when you have a whole pound of chicken to consume that will leave your mouth dry and leave you bloated after you drink a lot to quench your thirst and high sodium intake. More often then not, I always get the dried, salty chicken instead of the juicy, tender chicken that I once got at my very first visit. Perhaps I am unlucky and get the left over stale pieces that have been sitting out long. I can only recall once when my chicken was tender and juicy when they first opened.I try to avoid wasting money here because I have not had the same type of meal since my first. However, out of desperation to try something different than the usual univ city food, I have eaten here a few times to make this review justified.\n\nWhat my friends and I would like to do is split up and someone get french fries from Greek Lady and the others get chicken from Wishbone. We would satisfy our elementary palates by eating chicken fingers and french fries. If you are willing to walk a few more blocks, Allegros has really good curly fries but portions are a lot bigger when you eat at the place.\n\nI would have given this place 1.5 stars for the food, but they once cancelled a chicken wing eating contest on my friends and me just hours prior to the event with poor explanation so I knock it down to 0.5 stars, but yelp doesn't have 0.5 increments.",

  "text": "Scratching my head as to why my back pain still exists after a couple of chiropractic visits, I decided to try acupuncture. It cant' hurt, right? Or can it?????\n\nI called and made an appointment and was told my first visit would be 2 hours long. Upon arrival, I filled out various forms and answered lots of health questions before meeting my student acupuncturist. Soon Steve and Lori (Lori was very new and observing) took me to a separate room across the courtyard where the room was divided in two by Japanese type screens. I sat down with Steve as he went over my health profile and he asked very, very in-depth questions. After  spending considerable time doing this, I was asked to get up on the table. Steve felt pulses in various spots on my body and had Lori do the same. It's very interesting...they also look at your tongue several times! \n\nFinally, they decided on a treatment plan and left me to relax while they went to speak to the supervisor (I assume a licensed acupuncturist) to review the suggested treatment. Ten minutes later they came back and explained everything they'd do doing. Steve was very gentle and managed to hit all the right spots. Once all the needles were inserted, I was left to relax and listen to soothing sounds for about 15 minutes. They came back and took everything out and spent a few more minutes talking.\n\nI've since gone back a few more times and on my last visit, Steve added acupressure seeds to my ear. He asked one of the students studying Oriental Medicine to do a consultation and a particular Chinese herb was suggested.\n\nSo going back to my opening, let me tell you this - it doesn't hurt! Acupuncture can be very beneficial for so many things - not just pain. Give it a try!",

  "text": "My review is primarily about delivery and customer service.  \n\nDelivery.\nI have attempted (by myself and with friends/family) to have Reginelli's delivered to my house on four separate occasions in the last year.  The first time it came within the stated time frame and was ok, so we continued to order.  The last three times I've ordered Reginelli's they always say that delivery will be about 45 minutes (thats ok) but when the hour mark occurs I usually give them a call to ask as to the status of my order.  They always say, \"We're sorry, we suddenly got really busy, its on its way.\"  (This wasn't on a weekend, holiday or Mardi Gras, so go figure about the sudden rush)\n\n...\n\nMy pizza finally arrived somewhere around the 2 hr mark and was stone cold (all three times).  The first time I called them back to complain and the lady on the phone basically said, \"We're sorry, we'll replace it but it will be at least hour and a half before we get it to you.\"   The last two times, I didn't even bother to call.  \n\nIf a pizza delivery comes late once, thats understandable, it does happen, but when it happens three times with the same company then its time to call someone else.",

I don't have time to go back to the rental office, so I am stuck paying full price for a sub compact, and I have to use this vehicle for a 1400 mile trip. Never again will I use this rental agency.

Everything was good I had the seitan tenderloin which I always have liked and this was no different, and an Ard Ri to drink also delicious as always. \n\nThe bar seating is really tight but there are plenty of tables and a surprising amount of families. Also a general comment, I went with someone who is full on gluten free (celiac) figuring with their amount of veg friendly they would also be GF friendly. But she struggled to find something to eat, and items were not identified on the menu this is not specific to this location but some options may be a good idea for these folks.",

It was the tastiest thing I had during my trip in NOLA so far. There was a healthy amount of crawfish in it as well as good sauce and cheese. Although it had jalapeños, it wasn't too spicy. As far as the entree, it was ok. I had the Redfish NOLA. I liked the reddish, I liked the shrimp, and there was a nice amount of crab meat. However, it lacked a good carb (there was like 1 little red potato) and I would have liked a sauce. So although it tasted fine, it wasn't memorable.",

I have practiced with some of the top instructors in the world and taken yoga at the top yoga studios in New York and Los Angeles as well as doing three yoga teacher trainings with top studios like Yoga Works. This studio definitely meets my needs and reminds me of the large studios I use to practice with in L.A. It is such a wonderful vibe, amazing front desk staff who are very helpful, classes for every level, intelligent sequenceing ( which is important to avoid injury) and lovely teachers. I love Marley she has such  great energy and a caring heart. There are two showers and amenities when you come out after a hot sweaty workout. I took my boyfriend to a special workshop Roni was hosting and he walked out drenched and completely ZENed out! They have lots of workshops, a book club and a teacher training! They are even taking people to India for a retreat, which would be a dream to go to, next time! \n\nAll in all an amazing studio, I don't miss my big city studios when going here, a great place to practice!",

The buffet was not good at all even compared to other buffets.  I think the reason I felt that way immediately was I got 3 buffets and a 25 dollar game card that ended up costing over 50 dollars.  Doesn't sound too bad to get 3 buffets and some games but once you get in and see the buffet and the prices of the games it isn't worth it.  The buffet was only half open and the pizza wasn't hot.  The kids didn't seem to care because they were excited to play games.  Once we finished eating we went to the game area and things got worse.  5 frames of bowling for two kids  = $7!!!  Terrible.  Two go cart rides that was less than 3 minutes = $8.  2 roller coaster rides = $13!!!!!!!!  15 minutes and 25 bucks was gone!  I will say the employees were friendly and smiled.  However, we won't be back simply because for that price there are way better things to do.",

  "text": "Bob Diehl is one of the best mechanics I've ever dealt with. I had a Mercedes Benz that I'd owned for years and only drove in the Summer months. It always started right up after being in storage for the Winter one year it was somewhat hard starting. I took it to the M-B dealer who kept it for three days and had the mechanic come and talk to me when I picked it up. The mechanic tried to convince me that there was nothing wrong and that was the way it should be, I asked around and learned about Bob. I brought the car to him, he fixed the problem and informed me that the car had three cold start systems and two weren't working right. Minor repairs set them right and the car stared as it always had. Bob charged me little or nothing for the work and I then became a loyal client. I eventually sold the car and was upset that Bob didn't work on any other marques. I understand that he may, now. \n\nI'd buy a used M-B if for no other reason than I'd know I'd have a great mechanic who could work on it. He is extremely knowledgeable, highly competent, and his prices are very reasonable.",

  "text": "This is more than just an antique store. If Adam and Barbara Maitland from the movie \"Beetlejuice\" decided to open up a ghost version of a store post-becoming ghosts, this is what it might look like: everything's a little old and a little weird. I LOVE IT!!!\n\nDo you need an old portrait of a relative you've never had? What about a an old portrait of a relative you've never had with a preserved tarantula mounted on the print? Or one of dozens of found photos from varying eras of time? Or a taxidermy bear that's been mounted in the attack position? Yes? Then Anastacia's is the place for you! \n\nThis isn't the kind of place you go looking for something...it finds you. And I'm not exactly sure how many of these items are found \"as is\" or how many are helped along by the owners (for instance, was that ancient print of a scoliosis spine already in that super-ornate wooden frame that's probably an antique all on it's own and did it previously hang in some creepy doctor's office for a century, or did they decide to frame it, giving it a treasured and fancy presence behind the glass?), but every item is something special. I love the way they've curated so many bizarre items together without making the shopping experience overwhelming or fun-house-y. Everything here looks creep-ily treasured, as it should be.",

You can get almost anything here - from painted gourds to shrimps to organic lavender bunches to sweet cherries. Add in a backdrop of perfect weather and background music from a sitar player and a high school minstrel troupe and you'll start to get an idea of what's what here. All this and mas at totally reasonable prices too. I recommend trying out a cherimoya if you've never had one - it's a real treat!\n\nFor more info on the weekly schedule, check out the website - the one on Saturday is on the corner of Santa Barbara and Cota Streets and it goes from 8:30 to 12:30.

Overall I was actually happy with the lobby area, and the projector and sound system within the theater were quite nice, but the seats were worn down so far that you could feel the metal bars in your back. I'm young enough that this usually wouldn't be a problem, but I could definitely feel the metal for a few hours after the movie was over. The smell of the theater was definitely not the best either; something between stale popcorn and sweat. Still, considering that this theater can be anywhere from 30 - 40% cheaper than many other nearby options while having comparable, if not better, sound and projection quality than, for example, the Painters Crossing AMC, I'll probably be coming back.",

  "text": "Rick Lewis is pretty much Mark McGwire. The guy just keeps hitting home runs when he opens restaurants. First Southern and now Grace Meat + Three. By the way, I do realize McGwire took steroids but who didn't back then? It was the thing to do in the 90s! As was the Macarena. What a time to be alive!\n\nI met my brother here for a \"cheat day\" meal. I couldn't think of a better place to ruin all my hard work in the gym and in the kitchen than at this new southern cuisine hot spot in the Grove.\n\nIn order to get a taste of a few things we split a half hot chicken and half rack of BBQ pork ribs.  Our four sides: cornbread, Mac and cheese, fried potatoes, and greens.\n\nReview:\nHot chicken: unlike Lewis' other hot chicken place, Southern, this place only has one heat level. It's certainly spicy but not too spicy. As expected, the chicken was big, juicy, and crispy. It got my nose running and eyes watering. Loved it! It's pretty much what you'd get at Southern from what I could tell. That's good!  \n\nBBQ Ribs: Not overly meaty but plenty filling and topped with an excellent, sweet glaze. More than likely I'll be going for the hot chicken over the ribs from now on but that's 100% because the hot chicken is the Mayor of Flavor Town.\n\nFried potatoes: ours were fresh out of the oven. Very crispy, thick, and good seasoning.\n\nMac and cheese: not bad. Could have been more cheesy(everything in the world could be more cheesy, though, in my opinion). The crumble on top added a nice flavor.\n\nCornbread: Tasty. Not too sweet. More bread than corn...whatever that means...wink wink.\n\nGreens: I'm not a greens guy but my brother liked it.\n\nConclusion paragraph:\nI had high expectations going in. Especially since I've limited my carbs and calories for the last two weeks. A bad cheat meal would have = a sad Scott. However, I was very pleased with everything and highly recommend this to anyone looking to get some belt busting southern food!",

Rustic wood and metal made the dining room feel warm and contemporary.  Music was hip and a few beards could be seen.  The bull horns over the bar and the abstract cow scene paintings felt like a ranch house.  We ordered the Black and Blue burger medium and the Salmon burger medium.  The salmon burger was visually and texturally perfect and a moist and tender medium but under seasoned.  The quality of the salmon was good and flavor was clean.  The Black and Blue burger was cooked perfectly and seasoned.  I like the buns, brioche style buttered and grilled so they are soft and crispy.  On a side note they served home made ketchup and Heinz so the kids have something familiar.  The home cut fries were great as usual and with the truffle oil made them perfect we also tried the special side which was a roasted red potato and grilled okra salad.  It had a mayonnaise base with seasoned salt sprinkled on top which was good but not my favorite.  I liked that the okra was left whole but may be better with the mayo seasoned with the seasoned salt.  \n\nOver all I like Burger Up they are consistently good but wish they would season as they cook.  The staff are friendly and the restaurant including the restrooms are clean.  Jeremy was our server, he was there when we needed him and close by when we didn't a perfect balance that allowed us to enjoy our family lunch.",

There is no way I, or anyone for that matter, would have found this place if it weren't for someone just like you doing a review. Thanks guys!\n\nTucked away in a strip shopping center, albeit a cute shopping center, is this little non descript  restaurant. Since it was early in the day, we really weren't worried about a reservation although I did call as a just in case measure.\n\nWe wanted to sit outside since the back looks so pretty but were told it was closed but were led instead to an enclosed patio. Still nice. \n\nNicer still was when our server brought us bread, olive oil and a plate of marinated cannelloni beans with yellow and green squash. Wow! The squash were just a tad bland and needed salt but the beans were really flavorful.\n\nMy husband ordered the squash blossoms stuffed with ricotta and mozzarella cheese and I the beef carpaccio. Although I did miss capers on the beef and there was too much salad, both the dishes were really good.\n\nNow, our server gave us the list of specials and mentioned that two of them were served with langostines. I had seen these on one of the cooking shows but didn't know exactly what they were. My husband ordered the Carbonarra and I got the Langostines with a blush sauce served with lump crab and fresh tomato.\n\nMy dish was pricey, yes it was but incredibly worth it. Imagine a cross between a lobster, a shrimp and butter. Really. The langostines simply melt in your mouth leaving happiness behind. The carbonarra with panchetta instead of bacon my husband ordered is the best I've ever ordered or even tried to make. \n\nAs I've said, we were really early so we got to watch the prep of the restaurant between the the lunch and the dinner service. It was truly a privilege. These servers went through the place with precision, dusting, wiping, washing and primping every aspect of the restaurant. \n\nIf you go, and you should, bring a nice bottle of wine, order the langostines and the tiramisu. Enjoy!",

We arrived and chose where we wanted to sit. We were leisurely given menus and a long list of what they DIDN'T have on the menu. \n\nOur orders and our living social voucher were taken. Then there was apparently a problem with our voucher and a lot of back and forth w the waitress. Finally we were told it was ok but the waitress asked us for our order again bc she never put it in once there was a problem w the voucher! \n\nEventually the food came and it was just ok. I got the curry goat. It was mostly bones (large and small) and fat sadly, though the flavor was decent. It came with fried plantains which I love but these tasted like they had been reheated or microwaved or something. My husband got the jerk chicken which was full of little splinter bones. He had to be careful w every bite. He said the flavor was good but very spicy. \n\nI thought the prices seemed high considering the quality of the food and you get served water in disposable plastic cups (yet cloth napkins...). Also, you have to go outside to get to the bathroom which is pretty inconvient when it's raining out. Must be really annoying in the winter!\n\nAnother negative... No street parking in that area.

The elixirs (juice/kombucha type thing) are amazing! 32 ounces for 6 bucks! \n\nThe calamari is our favorite thing. We order it all the time. To be fair we usually only order from the seafood appetizer menu, but the calamari is nice. Also the tuna tar tar and ceviche are delicious. \n\nThe main menu is so-so in my opinion but the place is beautiful with floor to ceiling plan glass windows, a beautiful bar, stunning floor and great decor over-all. \n\nIt's a great place to people watch and have beer and wine. Plus they have wifi!",

I sent them an email and the next day got a phone call from Grant. I gave Grant my address because he stated he wanted to go out to look at the problem so he was able to give an accurate estimate. .Later that morning Grant called me. He said the cost of repairs would be $450.00. I told him he could do the job if he could do it for $450, maximum.\n     One week later, I got an invoice for $615 with a note that he had made a mistake on the estimate. I feel that at a bare minimum , I should have received a phone call to advise me of the significant additional cost in excess of the quoted price  of repair. I phoned Grant but did not receive an adequate explanation for why he would not have at least phoned me prior to significantly exceeding the $450 in repairs that he estimated and I authorized as a maximum.\n    I feel there are trust issues with this merchant. I will not use them again.",

Unlike other fast food chains that use selections of one or more, from the following categories: frozen; prepackaged foods; processed foods; meats that have added [artificially] growth hormones; products that contain pesticides; and artificial flavored and colored food products. The Panda Express uses fresh vegetables and the cooks make everything in woks as the orders are taken. The food is delicious and freshly made.\nAccording to the website: businessfranchise.com, The Panda Express is a franchised business.\nWikipedia documents, as of June, 2015, there are 1,746 locations in the USA and Puerto Rico.\nAndrew Cherng and his parents are from Jiangsu, a province in China. In 1973, Andrew and his father, Chef Ming Tsai Cherng opened their first restaurant in Pasadena, CA. Andrew dreamed of sharing his father's authentic recipes, for delicious Chinese cuisine, with the American people. Andrew also wanted to offer a choice of delicious entrées at inexpensive prices. As destiny intervened in Andrew's life, it just so happened that Andrew met Terry Donahue, the head football coach at UCLA and Dan Donahue who was Terry's brother, just so happened to have a Realtor company [Donahue Schriber Real Estate] that managed the Glendale Galleria, an upscale shopping center. Don offered Andrew the opportunity of a lifetime, to develop a fast-food version of his restaurant's entrées and his father's delicious recipes.\nAs fate would have it, this was just the beginning of Panda Express.",

It was cooked just how I asked (medium), but there wasn't a whole lot of guac on it, so I asked for a side, so I was happy! The garlic Parmesan  fries were not as good as I had expected. Not a lot of garlic or parm throughout the fries. Upon our second go-around of fries, the garlic and parm seemed more generous. I think I can do better if I try something on my own at home! I did enjoy some sweet potato fries and whatever it is that they serve it with, I need to find me some for home. It was a spicy type of ketchup dip,but ran more on the jelly/jam side.\n\nService was decent. At first our waitress was very present, but then when we needed drink refills (and more fries), she was nowhere to be seen. Otherwise she was pleasant and thought to bring us more napkins before we had asked. \n\nThe wait was about 25 minutes, but there were 5 of us and we asked for a table. Loud place, but not bothersome. I think I'll stick to Five Guys for my burger fix (but I would still come back here, though!)",

I wasn't sure what I'd find at Hendricks but I was pleasantly surprised as I was driving through the neighborhood. I liked the small town feel. Since I was by myself, I had planned on taking it to go and eating at the hotel but after walking inside, I had to stay to enjoy the decor. Light bulbs in mason jars, flat screen TV's and an amazing lighted patio. Although the view is just a parking lot, it's too bad it wasn't closer to the river behind it or had something else to look at. \n\nI ordered pork steak (which I've never heard of before) and it was really good. It looked like a T-bone but was tender enough to be cut with a fork. For my sides, I chose collard greens and cole slaw. The cole slaw was awesome. I have a weird ritual where I always order the cole slaw at different places to see how they make it. This one is definitely in my top 5. The slaw was finely chopped and had ground pepper in it, which I love. I usually put black pepper in my slaw anyways but this one was perfect. Cold and with a kick. Collard greens with a bit of bacon in it was good too. If I had more time or with a group of friends, I'd definitely come back because everything looked comfortably country.",

I told my partner it can't be any worse than the other mediocre places we have been going. I was wrong.\nThe take out service was fast for a Sat night. We were there within 20 minutes of ordering and it was ready. But the dining room was empty. For a Sat night that should have been a big clue. The rest of the places in the neighborhood were busy.\nThe steamed dumplings could have been great. The tasted homemade and the filling was good. However, they were so doughy with a really thick wrapper too thick that it detracted from the good filling. Everything else went downhill from there. \nThe beef and broccoli was inedible. The beef had an awful weird texture. Like it was boiled and was gelatinous.  The sauce on it had off flavors. We literally scraped it off our plates and threw the whole thing out.  The meat in both the general Tao's chicken and the orange beef also had weird textures. It was mushy and the coating was thick on those as well. The flavors in the sauces would have been fine, but they were gloopy.  The fried rice was fair but nothing memorable.\nWe won't be going back.",

I'm going to give the place the benefit of the doubt that it is not always like this as we came in at 10 PM, but if you cannot offer quality food at that hour then don't have your kitchen open. \nAll of our food came out within 5 to 10 minutes of ordering which leads me to believe it was not made fresh. The Caesar salad was room temperature and overdressed. The hush puppies were flavorless, and the chicken wings (3 full wings is a serving) were undercooked and barely warm. The only redeeming food item was the chicken and biscuits, which had a nice flavor profile- the biscuit was again, cold in spots. \n\nOn the positive side the place has a nice hip atmosphere and the service is friendly. \n\nUnfortunately, the food was so sub par we would not consider dining here again.",

The only thing that the owners and bartenders care about are the gamblers that get over-served and gamble there daily.   I'm definitely gonna stay away from that part of town after 4ish as that's when the \"heavy hitters\" come in to support the greasy, dirty, place that really only cares about their gamblers.  The kitchen has some kinda mold issues that literally smells like a sewer plant.  The 2 gals that have made a career outta this dump rely on the drunkards to tip them \"big\" if they win on the slots.  This is a very sad version of any kinda chicken joint or sports bar.  The greed that the owners share is obvious as flat screens are cheap these days and these guys can't even loosen their hands on the \"gambling profit\" to invest in to this dump.   Is sad as the original owners did a great job and these new guys don't care about anything except the profit from the slot machines, including the nasty food they serve.  The bartenders are high-strung and anything but friendly, unless of course, you are gambling big and they have a chance at a big tip.  \nYour better off going to the fast food chicken joint across the stree t\"El Pollo Loco\" and guessing the kitchen is cleaner and the staff is friendlier and you won't be subjected to the daily drunks that drive to and from this place daily.  VERY SCARY!!!",

Everything was excellent, I loved mine. Curry soup was tasty &I the fried chicken was done just right. Same for my sisters shrimp, fried just right with good quality shrimp. My wife lived her Shoyu Ramen.\n\nWe also got the pork buns which were excellent, but not your traditional porkbun. \n\nGreat, great experience.",

  "text": "Where do I start? Brew D Licious has the very best coffee in town. Hands down. I have tried them all and can say that there isn't another coffee house that even comes close. The minute I met the owner, I knew she was not only very well informed about how to brew a great cup of coffee, but also knows how to make the toughest of customer a repeat patron. This coffee is so good that I buy 5#s at a time from Brigitte. It is always fresh and she has even delivered coffee to me while she is under construction of her new place. Personally, I cannot wait until she opens her new location. I never did care much for the Hollander Hotel and I often felt that she was being stifled by the cramped space she worked in. Also, the hotel has a funky smell (sort of like old socks) so I will be glad when she is at her new location and I can sit and enjoy a good cup of coffee without trying to filter out the bad smell from the hotel. I know it will be a long line at the new location but it will be worth the wait.... Thanks Brigitte for showing St. Petersburg what real coffee tastes and smells like!",

My son and I had something called the wildflower triple that had scrambled eggs, bacon, and a waffle.  The waffles were very yummy were tender with the perfect golden crisp to them.  The bacon was a great balance of crispy without being over cooked.  \n\nPrices seemed reasonable to me, most items in the $5-8 range if I remember correctly.  Mine was $7.75 I think.\n\nOne last note is that they had good portion sizes.  The portion sizes are filling, without being super sized.  I was afraid when I order something called a triple it would be WAY too much food (even though the price was inline with other items on the menu).  It was two eggs, two pieces of bacon, and a deep pocket waffle the size of a coaster.  If you like huge portions of food look elsewhere.",

The wings are fried, and then soaked in sauce. To me, I wouldn't even call it sauce on most of them. It was more like oil, grease or the like. They didn't taste too bad. The parmesan wings didn't taste as good as they looked, but it was so-so for me. On my three visits there, I had the ten wings combo (with fries and drink). The supposedly hot wings weren't as spicy (sorry guys I've had better...). The crinkle cut fries were alright as well. I did use them to dip into the leftover wing sauce on the plate. Which brings me to a point: this is probably the first wing place that I visited that doesn't offer dipping sauce (like ranch and blue-cheese). But I got by. Plus I had the blasting Top 40 music to keep me less bored. All in all, it was A-OK.",

We wandered in because we couldn't find anywhere else. \n\nIt's unclear how you're supposed to find a table, but customers are just supposed to grab a table. There's a sort-of line that forms by the bar, but no one working there organizes it at all.\n\nWe sat down quickly, but I think it was just lucky timing because for the rest of our meal people were waiting to sit. Also, there's only one bathroom and it took FOREVER to use it. They seriously need to have more than just one bathroom.\n\nI ordered the crab cakes florentine, which were really good. The potatoes needed more spice (aka hot sauce) but the meal was really flavorful. The chef cooked the eggs perfectly, but there was nothing to scoop up the runny egg with since there was no bread. My friend ordered the french toast and it was not impressive. Just a few slices of bread with cinnamon and some egg on top. Not filling or visually stunning. \n\nOur waitress was not particularly nice and seemed angry with us when we didn't want to order drinks. Many people did seem to have their food and then get a drink to-go as they walked around Jackson Square. \n\nI'd say you should go here if you're really hungry and can't find anywhere else.

One big complaint is that they don't have an organized system for seating guests. The servers don't always greet incoming patrons (which should be required Waffle House-style) and they sometimes tell you to seat yourself (which can lead to one or two people taking up tables for 4) or they'll seat you (whenever they get around to talking to you). \n\nI've ordered a several different dishes at this point and they have varies from ok to awesome. The chicken wings and onion rings are just ok. The wings are either lightly dredged in flour or not at and then fried whole. They aren't really seasoned so the wings are pretty bland. The \"onion rings\" made of formed, chopped onions that are breaded. The chicken fingers were a bit over battered and dry. The smashwich (or whatever it's called) was pretty good: your choice of breakfast meat with hash browns and eggs in a hoagie roll, but unspectacular. The club sandwich is classic diner fare that is very well executed. The egg and omelette platters are a very good deal and dang tasty. The best thing on the menu is definitely the waffle. It's gently sweet, very crispy and covered in butter. So good!\n\nThe service is generally pretty attentive (once you're seated), the restaurant and bathrooms are very clean, the food is a good, tasty value",

The prices aren't any different from other stores but they do have a larger selection of gifting (figurines,mugs,blankets etc) as well as the largest collection of titles that don't fit into what is new and hot at the moment. Anything that they don't carry can actually be ordered in for you but I have to say staff here are not always the best at phoning customers to let them know when their titles are in so one should definitely keep their number by the phone to check in with them after a week or so.\n\nThe biggest selling point for me here besides the selection has to be the staff at the tills. It can get a little busy here but lines are always dealt with quickly and I appreciate that they don't push as hard as other locations to try and sign you up for a pure card. F.Y.I to anybody considering the pure rewards program the redemption items are not that great. It took me about a year of collecting just to accumulate enough points for a true blood key chain and when I got it it was placed in a bubble mailer and not even in it's original packaging. Needless to say when it came time to renew the card I opted out.\n\nAnyways to sum it all up I will say for selection and speedy service these guys get five stars but the prices as well as the sometimes slow ordering process drop it down to a 3. Still worth checking out though if you have been on the hunt at smaller stores for a particular movie or cd.",

This is your classic old school place.  Waiter we had was amazing, and that never hurts your experience.  Everything we ate was great - apps, sides, meats, desserts.\n\n100% I recommend getting the prime rib.  We got a steak and a prime rib and split the two.  they didn't name the place 'the prime rib' for no reason, right?  Probably the best prime rib I've ever had, was way better than their filet, makes it a unique experience from the other steak joints in town.",

  "text": "Philadelphia, I love you.  Places like this remind me why.  We sat at the counter and watched the guys make the pizzas.  Our son hates cheese on a pizza and they had one already on the menu for him: The Marinara (oregano, crushed san marzano tomatoes, garlic, olive oil).  It was simple... but delicious. If you like real wood-fired pizzas that char the crust (a little blackened... in a good way), this is the place to go to.  Our other favorite pizza joints that rival this place are Lombardi's (NYC) and Grimaldi's (Brooklyn).  We all had a slice and were shocked at the lovely simplicity of it. Razor thin slices of garlic dotted the fresh tomato sauce.  My husband and I shared the Salsiccia (fennel sausage, roasted fennel, tomato sauce, mozzarella).  Roasted fennel on a pizza?  Brilliant. I cried a little.  No wait... I REALLY cried when we shared this cocktail: The Brooklyn (Dad's Hat rye, Luxardo cherry, white vermouth).  It says it serves one, but they brought it out in a cute little bottle and gave us each a glass...each with a hand- crafted giant square ice cube (hipster-cool) and Luxardo cherries.  Perfection.  We also shared a Rotolo (pizza dough, mortadella, ricotta, pistacchio pesto).  Those are crazy amazing.  I kept saying my husband could eat the rest... then freaking out and going back for another bite. He's lucky I didn't stab him in the hand with a fork to fight over the last bite (to be fair, he was the smart one who ordered it).  I could've eaten several of those and forgotten the pizza (although that was wonderful too!).  We finished with a little dessert... perfect little Italian cookies (\"Cookie Jar\" - pignoli, almond cookies, chocolate biscotti, pistacchio gnocchi) and I got an Affogato (fiordilatte soft serve with a shot of espresso).  The soft serve is Italian sweet cream... decadent and lovely... with rich espresso in a pretty little Italian mug.  I'm in Heaven here.  I know nothing about Vetri's other restaurants, but I'm checking them out next time I'm in Philadelphia!  By the way... service was great and friendly.  5 stars all around!",

  "text": "The food was pretty tasty. Nothing outstanding though. It reminds me of any Mediterranean food truck that I've been to. It's a nice late night spot. Definitely hits the spot at the end of the night. To me, the amount of food you get for the price could be improved but I would not say that I feel ripped off. The amount of food you get is fair but I think it'd be easier to justify if you got a little more. \n\nThere's plenty of seating. Despite being near a whole bunch of bar/club scenes, once you're inside it's easy to take a break and have a nice conversation. It is all very clean and well kept. The servers are quick and friendly. When I went there were only two guys working but they weren't busy so it didn't take too long. The entire restaurant is very dimly lit and the atmosphere is a bit of a hodgepodge of things. On one wall there is a mural of outer space and the music that plays seems to have no rhyme or reason to it. \n\nIt's a bit of a strange place but I would definitely go back.",

  "text": "When giving friends from out of town a tour of the French Quarter, one can only expect they want some classic New Orleans dishes. I've been here a couple of times, but they were the ones that wanted to go, due to their lunch special. It's a nice, well know restaurant that offers a 17.00 lunch special that includes a soup or salad, entree, and the option for a 4.00 Bloody Mary or martini. I got the Bloody Mary and it was a great size for the price. It was spicy and hit the spot.\nThey text message you when your table is ready, so were able to walk around the quarter while we waited. Thank god a lot of restaurants are getting rid of the those buzzers that make you feel like you are under house arrest. \nWe sat down to a beautiful table right by the open shutters. The servers, were ok. They were busy, but forgot a couple of things we asked for. It was still a great experience though!\nI got the pork chop with red beans and the turtle soup. The turtle soup was one of the best I have had. The pork chop was cooked to perfection and the read beans were seasoned very well. It came with cornbread, but it was very dry. After this lunch at noon, I didn't find myself hungry till it was basically time for bed. It was a very generous portion and well worth the money.\n\nMuriel's is a great way to get a classic, good quality New Orleans meal at a decent price. The location is spectacular, and the history behind the restaurant made for great conversation at the table.\nDefinitely check it out if you are in the Quarter!",

  "text": "Gluten free pasta...I had to try. Plus, 1/2 price wine Mon-Thurs did not disappoint.  The selection was just right.\n\nWe found street parking as the lot was full, and at 7pm waited a bit for a table as they don't accept reservations for parties of less than 6.\n\nTo start, we ordered the Escargot, and it came from the kitchen screaming hot. So hot, the cheese had broken. I was looking forward to the crunchy brown bits to munch on but only had a couple of small bits that survived.  As a celiac, I couldn't dunk for the garlic butter, and they didn't bring any bits for my dining companion to dunk after I had finished.  Our server was MORE than helpful, we could have asked, but wondered if this was how it was usually served.\n\nNext I ordered the daily special - squid, mussels and shrimp with a garlic butter sauce and gluten free penne corn pasta.  I'm not usually a fan of a single ingredient gluten free pasta - corn tends to be a bit dry and fussy.  Tonight was not much of an exception.  \n\nTasty? Oh my YES. But again, without (gluten free) bread or bun to soak up that beautiful garlic butter sauce - a bit sad.  The seafood was cooked to perfection, and I don't get to say that very often.  The penne... well, stab it with a fork and some broke in half. A large spoon would have been a great addition to the dish for scooping.  I think I managed OK, because I ate almost all of it and forgot to take pictures!\n\nMy dining companions all finished their meals and had desserts which looked fantastic - tiramisu was beautiful and large! Some would share it, but for others, it's just right. \n\nBe prepared to leave by 9:30pm on a Thursday, as the cleaners apparently come soon after! (I've never heard that before, but...Ok.)\n\nNot every establishment can handle gluten free ingredients or diners, but they did well.  They weren't certain if the gelato was safe, and probably cross-contamination from others might be an issue, so good call by our waitress.  I'm looking forward to the single serving packages of buns from certain gluten free bakers (wink wink) that might make it easier for restaurants to thaw only one at a time (yes, you have to keep them frozen until serving - they get dried out, inedible and gross pre-thawed).\n\nI believe we will return to try more items on their menu.",

So I'm giving it a 4 star because these people have pushed it to the very point of being as Cajun/NOLA/Southern as they can with the demographic thats around. Anything more involving fried oysters, more crawfish, more fried anything, hard cajun spices, LSU and Saints decor, the locals wouldn't come. So I give them a thumps up for making it as close as Carmel-Indy will allow to stay in business.\n\nNow the food, its good. Not awesome, but I don't expect it to be. I had the pick three; Crawfish Casserole, Gumbo and Jambalaya. All fair sizes, all had a little kick. I would go again on my way through Carmel. More of a lunch place than dinner, but thats up to you.\n\nI hope they stay open and continue to grow.\n\nLaissez les bons temps rouler !",

You need books, you need a place to browse, talk with other book lovers, and listen to book readings. Indy Reads is that place. And it's more than that because all proceeds support a great cause, adult literacy. Most of the books are used so donate a book and pick up a new (used) one. You may be surprised at all the books they have that you didn't even know you wanted. They also have a small selection of new books. If they don't have what you're looking for, you can order it. The one thing I don't really like is that the $1 children's books can be jammed so tightly that it's hard to look through them. The kids books are also arranged by color, which makes it harder for me to distinguish between titles as I glance through. Prices are excellent throughout, and the space is really nice.

I was disappointed that the value of the meal seems a little lackluster, being quite pricey for what you get.\n\nI have to knock this original review from 4 stars to 3 stars though because b.good is consistently slow in getting your food ready for you and the friendliness of the service is typically iffy, depending on who's serving you though. And yes, I know you can do online ordering to help with the wait times but as far as I'm concerned, there's no reason why you should have to do online ordering for 'fast food'.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, b.good is trying to market themselves as real fast food. The food is real, but it's definitely not fast, and I don't know if it warrants the prices they're charging with the service they provide. That and considering how there are so many awesome/similar eateries in that shopping center already (like Zoes Kitchen, Chipotle, & Panera Bread), it's hard for me to keep b.good at a 4 star.",

He is always responsive, does a great job and makes my yard something I don't worry about.  He does the spring turn on, sends guys to fix broken sprinklers, does PHENOMENAL clean up when I ask, shuts down and winterizes the yard and truly, truly loves what he does. If you let him do his job you will be thrilled.  I don't ever worry about my dogs being let out and he is familiar with both of them!!!\n\nHe is honest, hard working and his crew is great.  If you are in need of a great service Keeping it Green and Robert are your company.  He also sells Christmas trees and we just love him.  There is no one better!!!!",

I had an issue with a warrantied battery replacement, and it turned out that I owed a portion of the battery costs after they submitted the claim. They didn't call me and tell me that I owed them the money. They just noted it on my file until the next time I came in for service, which wasn't until months later--they didn't have to wait like that, but they did without me even asking.  The shop is super clean, the owners are super nice, and they always have Corvettes, Vipers, Lotus, Jaguars, classic cars, or some other expensive car that they are working on or selling.",

  "text": "If you're reading this review you're most likely one of the following: somewhat new to the Pinellas County area, a snowbird looking for Honda service, new to the world of Honda, or you broke up with Honda years ago and realized it's time to go back to the best car you've probably ever owned...\n\nWhatever the case, you're looking to avoid the trek into Tampa, right? This means you've got two options, AutoNation or Crown. Based upon personal experience (this happened to both my brother and husband), if you head to AutoNation first, you'll probably find yourself purchasing from Crown. Here's why. \n\nFrom Service to Sales, They're There to Help.\nIronically, I was helping Mom clean her three-year-old CRV interior. Her New York-dealership lease was up in two months (she moved here two years ago and needed to find a new trusted Honda dealership). Once the interior seats were clean, we were ready to hit the car wash. Boom. The three-year old battery died leaving us stuck in my driveway.\n\nHonda roadside assistance towed the car to the dealership - at no charge of course. Crown offered to replace the battery for free allowing her time to think about her next move. Regardless, I was confident we'd roll out in a new Honda, but didn't want her to worry. She's dealt with Michelle and Brooks in service several times and knows they're both awesome, so having had positive experiences with them helped.\n\nNo Real Pressure. No Real Up-Sell.\nKaren handled our lease deal with management assistance from Vinny. She listened and understood that Mom, a senior, is far from tech savvy - bells and whistles scare her. Mom no longer deals with ice and snow - no need for four-wheel drive and needs to feel comfortable on the road. Her previously-leased 2012 Civic was too tight and too low to the ground. With all of this in mind, they set her up with a standard-feature H-RV crossover vehicle to reach her price point, style and comfort requirements. \n\nJustin Simplifies the Finance Process\nYou've found your ideal car thanks to Sales, now it's time to pay up. Oy, the stress, right? No. Justin puts you at ease with humor, warmth, and banter knowing the stress involved in coughing up the cash. When we told tell him Mom obviously didn't need a top-of-the line coverage plan on a leased car, but only trusts the dealership for service, he worked with her...\n\nReady to Rock and Roll\nRegardless of the dealership closing in thirty minutes, Karen sat with us in Mom's new H-RV and walked her through each and every feature. From actually setting up and testing her iPhone speed dial numbers via bluetooth, to setting up her quick-find favorite soft rock radio stations - every question was answered. I've had this with Volkswagen, but Mom said she's never experienced that with Honda. \n\nOverall Positive Customer Experience \nWe left feeling great about the purchase. We liked getting to know the staffs' personal background - where they're from, details about their families, etc. Enjoyed complimentary cups of tea, coffee, cocoa, and bottled water - car shopping is serious business. We were there for four hours - keeping hydrated is key. Another reviewer said they make you feel like family and honestly, they did. \n\nSweet Sidenote\nCrown apparently loves animals. While out on the lot, we had the pleasure of meeting Oliver, a local orange and white outdoor-cat. Though his owner lives near the dealership, Oliver's made Crown his second home and the crew doesn't seem to mind sharing the outdoor space with him one bit. Loved this!",

  "text": "They used to make an Amiga bowl that had an abundance of shredded grilled chicken on the bottom of a flour tortilla bowl, a layer of rice topped with grilled onions and peppers with a queso sauce drizzeled over the top.\nTonight there was no rice nor any shredded chicken, it had been replaced with chicken crisps. They are the outer parts of a grilled chicken breast with no moisture and very few of them.\nHaving met the owner in the past and having his wife wait on me I knew something wasn't right.\nI explained to the waitress that this dish had changed and wasn't good! She politely offered something else. What to order...if they had modified a basic dish what was next?\nTo my surprise a male manager came out and \"informed\" me that this is exactly what they had been serving for 10 years and I must have either special ordered something or was mistaken.\nI said this is not what they had served me for the past 5 years and I never had requested a special order before. \nI also asked what they had done to the phenominal soft tacos? They were usually served in a soft warm flour tortilla and had moisture and flavor. Tonight they were stale and crisp and the filing was bland.  Again he informed me I was mistaken while he held my order that had been sent back to the kitchen in front of me.\nI apologized and said I didn't wish for anything else, thank you.\nAnother manager came out a few moments later apologizing and stated that they are unfamiliar with what I had ordered and would \"special order\" anything I wanted. I declined.\nApparently their cook walked out tonight and they were winging it.\nToo bad it was a good place to get a good mexican meal.\nTwo thumbs down on Poblano's.",

We had the pepperoni, socrates revenge, and bronx bomber.  It's like a eatting a brick of salt.  I'm not sure if it's the amount of salt sauce combined with the salty meat, but the combo so overwhelming, I tastebuds are numb to any other flavor.  Otherwise, if they fix that, I would love it.  \n\nAs for the salads, they're a good size, but seems like something you can toss together yourself.

Our egg drop soup came out right away at a nice piping hot temperature and when the rest of our food came out it was practically room temperature. \n\nFeeling adventurous, I had ordered the Shrimp with Candied Walnuts entree with brown rice while he ordered the Sesame Chicken platter. I like the idea of sharing food, but my food was too busy all on its own without adding something else to the mix. The brown rice was cold and very bland while the shrimp was overly sweet and I didn't feel like the candied walnuts and melon balls were complementary flavors.\n\nThe chocolate cake we had for dessert was amazing though; 6 layers of chocolate on chocolate. It was so sweet and rich, we ended up sharing a slice.\n\nSo to sum up, service was great, dessert was great, but the food needs some work. Sorry PF Changs, I just am not impressed.\n\nOne thing I will note (that our server told us) is that they are very big on catering to food allergies (especially gluten).",

They are always on top of the newest \"it\" items for your home and style. They also allow dogs in their store so that's a huge plus because I'm typically walking my dog when I stop in. \n\nThe only reason I am not giving them five stars is that although their employees are super friendly, they definitely watch you. I understand the need for this because they have little items that probably get stolen a lot but I always feel like I have no privacy to browse and debate any purchases. \n\nCheers!",

He emailed me a specific unit, price, move in date and application. I filled out the paperwork but was unable to find the specific unit he indicated. When trying to call about my problem no one answered for 2 full business days. Then when talking with another very unhelpful employee, she told me that unit was already gone & suggested other units more expensive & not in the move in date discussed. When asking if they would honor the price originally discussed in email correspondence, they would not. Long story shorter, I cancelled my application & just wasted $50. This business only cares about money & does not care about the tenants at all.",

The potatoes are  well seasoned and cut small, so you don't end up getting a burrito that is about 95% full of overdone, mushy potatoes. You can actually taste the eggs, bacon and potatoes. Could use a bit more cheese, but that's a minor complaint. Nice selection of salsas at the salsa bar and the staff has always been friendly and welcoming. Very glad that they are located about a mile from my house! Hopefully they will be here for a long time.",

The service is very good,  always right there when you need something, staff is very friendly. My family and I love Mae's and what makes it better are the prices.

The wings were on the small side. Aside from that they were not crispy and I didn't taste any honey in the sauce. I'd probably order them again but make sure you specify extra crispy. The pizza however, was awesome. I got the Parma. I made sure they added the arugula AFTER the pizza was cooked. It was so good that even though I'm stuffed I can't wait until I'm hungry again so I can enjoy my leftovers!  They also had a twisted pretzel beer that tasted like a pretzel!!!  It was so good and not heavy even though it was a dark beer. Make sure to go next door and get some gelato for dessert.",

As for the wings they are great, always large and perfectly crispy, and totally drenched in sauce. I haven't tried anything else on the menu that I can vouch for. My issue with this place is the service, on the phone it always seems like an inconvenience that I am calling in an order and the call is always rushed. And in person when we are feeling daring enough, the staff always looks like they are in the weeds or behind on all their work. What has brought me to write this review is the mid 30 looking, tall server. Her attitude is unnecessary, her guest interaction screams lack of training and her aura if this counts for anything seems like a black cloud moving through the restaurant. I don't usually let service bother me as long as the food holds up but I just don't like her. And that's that. I'll finish up this dozen of hot, wipe my fingers and contemplate dining in again.",

The other reasons were:  price, vicinity to my aunt's home and complementary breakfast. \n\nMy family and I typically stay at the Hyatt Place/House when we're traveling.  However, since it was just my brother and I, I figured we'd give Holiday Inn a shot. \n\n+  The staff were very friendly and helpful.\n+  Free wifi.\n+  Breakfast was very good, offering both hot and cold entrees. \n\n-  Sadly, the beds were WAY TOO soft.  It felt as if the mattresses were past their life expectancy.  As a result, I didn't really sleep well for most of my three nights there.\n-  The a/c was hit and miss with the lack of reliable thermostat controls. \n\nThere was a pool and hot tub, but since I didn't utilize either, it wouldn't be fair to rate them.  There also a small gym that I didn't use either. \n\nAll in all, it was just ok.  Hyatt has spoiled me.",

  "text": "A little outside of downtown Indianapolis is an area called Broad Ripple, and here you can find a place that transports you to a modern pristine Parisian bakery. You literally walk in and no longer feel like you are in Indiana. Everything is sparkly and glittery, and the smells are divine. \n\nWe made the trek by uber to this neighborhood and really wanted to try this place! We arrived around 11 for an \"early lunch\" slash \"snack\". We ordered the quiche of the day which was quiche Lorraine and the famous Earls Court Chocolate Cake.\n\nThe quiche was quite delicious. The egg was so fluffy and savory while the crust was super flaky and had a great bacon flavor.  This was a perfect snack to split between 2 people and just hit the spot!\n\nIt was so hard to decide which cake to try. One gripe that I have about this place is the price of the cake slices. The slices are quite large and pricey. If you only come with 2 people it is hard to get a few things to share without either breaking the bank or stuffing your face with dessert. I asked if we could do 1/2 slices, but was politely denied. A suggestion I have would be to allow fractions of slices so people can try multiple different cakes.\n\nMy wife loves chocolate and I love all sweets so we opted for the famous chocolate cake. There was so much great chocolate flavor and for the most part, the cake was super moist. It seemed like the edges of the cake might have been a little over cooked/on the dryer side but the flavor was delightful!",

The view, although not super high, is breathtaking and gives you a good look at the beauty of Santa Barbara.\n\nWe saw high schoolers doing some sort of club activity here (maybe MUN?) but that didn't stop us from enjoying the courthouse. You are free to walk he grounds--no intrusive security guards or large tour groups. It didn't feel so touristy/museum-y either which for some reason made me appreciate the experience all the more.\n\nThe best part of all--it's free! You won't need to set aside a ton of time here (maybe 30-45 min). There's ample street parking around the courthouse, at least on a weekend so get over here stat!",

  "text": "I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars, but have decided to go with the more generous offering?  Why?  Because this place has one of the most generous menus as far as choices go.  There is a ton to choose from, even if you're vegetarian.  \nFormalities first--why can't there be some ambiance at Indian restaurants.  I know I'm painting with broad strokes here, but it seems like outside of NYC, no Indian restaurant in the US can get creative with their dining space.  Not sure why that is, but whatever.\nAn early arrival on a Sunday found the place quiet, with maybe 10 or so people dining.  No problem getting a table for 2.  We started the evening off with some garlic Naan.  Delicious, although I think next time I'll stick with regular, at almost half the cost.  We also got some Finger Paneer, little spiced fried cubes of cheese.  These were denser than typical Paneer.  The cheese was slightly bland, but the spices were good.  Overall, an enjoyable start to the meal.  I also had a lemonade, which may have been made fresh.  Regardless, it was tasty. \nEntrees included Paneer Bhurji and Lamb Shahi Korma.  We elected \"spicy\" as our seasoning level.  I'll admit, I have a pretty strong ability to deal with spiciness.  But this was some ultra-spicy food when it arrived!  We quickly ordered a mango lassi to help put out the fire.  Still, even through the spices, there were decent flavors coming through.  The nutiness of the Korma was especially nice, as was the blended creaminess.\nI'm intrigued enough to return for more offerings.  I am humbled however by their spiciness--something that has not happened to me in many many years.  Next time, I am going to stick with \"medium\" spiciness!",

This was seriously one of the best meals of my ENTIRE life.  \n\nThis review was from about 2 months ago.  Sorry it is a little dated.  Such as life.  \n\nThe setting is an old church.  It is really a beautiful surrounding for a restaurant.  Although I am an old church architecture nerd.  It was really cool to look around.   \n\nThe service was incredible.  I was hear as part of a group of 7 other characters, several were part of the NOLA restaurant scene.  We wanted a good time with the meal and they provided it!   \n\nPaneed smoked soft shell crab a la Christian.  I was not fortunate enough to have enjoyed the original.  I can not comment on the faithfulness to the founders recipe.  I can say this there is no highe calling for a soft shell crab than to be cold smoked and fried in preparation for this dish.  On to your 77 virgins and mecca for you!  But I experienced heaven eating this.  \n\nSeafood stuffed filet of fish a la Christian's - This was superlative.  Again did not try the original, but the mirliton and seafood stuffing was heavenly, and more importantly improved the taste of the fresh flounder rather than competing for the spot light!   \n\nThe combination was quite possibly one of the 10 best meals of my life.  If you have been here, you should try it!",

  "text": "I went here on a Wednesday night and, though it wasn't busy, there were no open tables without a reservation,  except the tall tables in the bar area. It still seemed to be a very quiet place anyway. \n\nThe location is not attractive, the street is dark and mostly empty at night, but the inside is stylish in a masculine, refined sort of way; dark wood, low light, maps on the walls and prints of watercolors depicting old Missouri scenes. It was a great place for a quiet, intimate dinner. They've got a couple of TVs up above the bar. \n\nThey seemed very well staffed, as if each table had its own server. \n\nThe menu is one page but very intriguing, I had so many questions for our server about \"what is this?\" and \"what is that?\" and he was totally nice and knowledgeable about the menu items. He seemed nervous and unsure at first, but he was friendly and made sure to check on us frequently. \n\nWe decided to split 3 small plates and a side dish between the two of us and, honestly, it was a little too much food for just two people. Perhaps we don't have hearty enough appetites.\n\nTheir menu is so varied and interesting, it's really all over the map in terms of seasonings and ethnic origins but the main focus seems to be rustic and warming - at least at this time of year. I have a feeling they may change it up from time to time. I'm sure you'll get things here you won't find anywhere else. The prices are very reasonable, considering the planning and good execution of the food. You'd certainly find more expensive, and less original places in Clayton and down town. \n\nWe ordered the smoked trout, the venison hot dogs, the mini monte cristo sandwiches, and the french fries. \n\nThe venison hot dogs and the smoked trout were fantastic and interesting. The french fries were very well made, and the dipping sauces delicious. I was so impressed with these that I was then a bit underwhelmed by the mini monte cristos. Since everything else there seemed to have a unique spin on it, I expected them to do something original here as well, but they were just like any monte cristo you might have. They were very tasty of course, but nothing new. \n\nWith the food plus two draft beers, our total was $52.05 before tip and we were stuffed and satisfied. I applaud them!",

The waitress we had was as good as ones we've had in previous locations: super cheerful, adorable, and prompt at checking on drinks and clearing away the plates.\n\nWe went today to check out Pliny the Younger, and while the ensuing scene was a little chaotic (maybe drink tickets would have been easier?) with two lines on either side of the store, they did the best they could, letting in 10 people at a time until the restaurant was filled. We were worried about our friend, who was running late and doesn't like beer, not being allowed in, but she had no problems after letting the host know we were waiting for her.\n\nThe food was also delicious. We all shared the Asturian Blue cheese which was nicely complimented by a blackberry sauce, I had the wild mushroom sandwich which had a lovely lemony flavor, my boyfriend had the three cheese sandwich (which I have ordered before and is quite good), and our friend had the truffled egg toast, which we have also tried before and is one of the standout starter items.\n\nAll in all, I have yet to be disappointed by an experience at a Tria in either location, even with these crazy extenuating circumstances!",

We were initially concerned with the 25 minute wait outside, but were pleased when they called us after just 10 minutes. \n\nI had the French toast which was outstanding, and my sister ordered the grilled cheese, which was \"one of the best she's ever had.\" \n\nThe place was hopping, the staff was friendly, and they're very fast and efficient. Overall, AMAZING place to have breakfast in Tucson.",

  "text": "Our very foodie friend Marc recommended \nMr B's as one of his top 3 in NOLA. We had a truly delicious dinner at KPaul's the night before, and we had high expectations. We walked in with a conference group of 6. Restaurant was fancy and crowded but they were able to seat us right away! Everyone enjoyed. The gumbo appetizers, 3 soup sampler, artichokes, and fried oysters were amazing. Best fried oysters ever. Huge pork chop. Red snapper delicious but portion a little small. Nearby tables had their famous shrimp--looked messy and tasty. We tried 3 of their desserts--all good, especially pecan pie. Three amazing servers for our table--very attentive. Definitely worth it.",

  "text": "Sorry, no.\nHave visited twice, and those visits were months apart.\n\nTrip #1 had fried ravioli app that was quite good and pasta with shrimp that was not.  Way, way garlic heavy and runny, runny sauce.  Hubby had an average burger.  We both remembered it being loud, but we thought maybe still worth a second trip.\n\nTrip #2 they first tried to seat us right in front of the guitar player.  Asked to move upstairs, and still way loud.  Ordered the same fried ravioli app - way overcooked and disappointing.  This time I ordered the Shepherd's Pie, marked as one of their specialties and they are all a pub after all.  Wrong.  Big mistake.  Horrible.  Their Shepherd's Pie is a base of browned meat with something red speckled in (maybe pimentos?), with a huge slab or potatoes that were not creamy, not hot, and not flavorful.  And a HUGE slab.  Beside that there was obviously microwaved broccoli still way chunky and microwaved baby carrots... both absolutely plain except for a brown canned gravy poured over everything.  Gross.  I ate like three bites and lost my appetite and shoved aside.  When the waitress asked if I wanted a box and I said no.... you'd think she'd inquire, right?  No, she did not.\n\nHubby had a burger that was good, but in his words Five Guys a few storefronts up is better.  His steak fries were also good.\n\nWe don't drink beer, and this is clearly a sports and beer lovers place.  We tried, twice, and are done.  No, thank you.",

  "text": "We wandered into Slate because the wait for brunch at Day by Day was longer than we were willing to wait. Unfortunately, getting seated immediately at Slate does not imply that you will get your food any faster. There were two other people in the restaurant when our party of six was seated but, despite the emptiness, our food somehow took 45 minutes to make. When we asked about the status of our meal we were told that they were doing their best but to keep in mind that \"we were a six-top without a reservation...\" Personally I think that having or not having a reservation seems rather irrelevant when your restaurant has plenty of open tables...\n\nIn conclusion, I've experienced better and faster service. \n\nIf you have the time, the brunch is good (I enjoyed the frittatas and home fries/chips - although that may have been my hunger talking).",

I just wish I could remember all their names so I could give them all KUDOS. I wrote them down on my receipt and now can't find it or the names. The manager was there and she helped the person who was trying to figure out my total (because if you have a brochure and need 100 copies that means both sides need to be printed but it means you pay for 200 copies but only obtain 100 brochures). I was glad the manager was there to help. All of the four young women who were working that day were super sweet and friendly. \n\nThe store was clean and well organized. I got 4 ear bud  be (head phones) cause they were on sale 2 for $10. Plus I got them in four separate colors.\n\nIt was Friday before Labor Day weekend. Because of the 3 day weekend there were lots of print orders. It seemed like several were frazzled. So even if they were all frazzled they were able to be professional and super sweet. They wrote up my order and gave me my total and then I paid for it. I sure how that Office Depot reads this and finds out who was working Friday and gives them all KUDOS. So sorry ladies that I forgot your names.",

Upon reaching the cemetery we saw that there were tons of other tour groups there - our guide was great at ushering us around and through the maze of narrow passageways to give us the most personal experience possible. \n\nBestie and I had an amazing time doing this tour, both being totally crazy about tours like this!

You'll find bagels, donuts, and (MmmMmm) you'll find coffee... I'll ignore the sandwiches for now.\n\nFOOD\nWith a word like \"bagel\" in the title, I expected the bagels to blow me away. With around 20 types of bagels-- they are DELICIOUS to eat without additions or toasting, but don't expect to substitute your New York plane tickets for these. I'm a donut fan and these are a hit or miss. If it has thick frosting, the frosting BREAKS APART from the donut in chunks! Noooo! But if the frosting has been glazed on, it was done so with love and partly melts into the donut dough which makes it delicious. \n\nAh coffee--although some types are served a bit small for the price--MmmMmmm. Awesome, many choices. It complements the dough-ness of the food and comes in many forms. A side area allows for self-service. \n\nSERVICE\nThe employees run the place like a corporate business: serious, brisk, unsmiling. The quick service is awesome as well as the acknowledgement upon entry... but it doesn't seem like these guys get buddy-buddy with anybody. I'm assuming they have cult fans--I've seen ALL types of people go here. ALLLLL freakin' types. (That's a good thing)\n\nLOCATION APPEARANCE\nThe store blends into the not-so-pretty plazas of St. Pete's 4th Street. Worn out signs outside, dusty parking lot... stark contrast from the comfiness that seems to radiate nuclear energy from inside. Cool-- at the side you can watch a baker creating the pastries for the store.",

  "text": "On 3/5 (big snow day in Nashville) a couple of friends and I went to Local Taco in Sylvan Park for dinner.  When we arrived, the place was jam packed, and we knew there would be quite the wait.  I live right by Local Taco, and frequent the place.  Food is always delicious, along with the margaritas!  The Shrimp Taco is my favorite, along with the Local BBQ (try it out!)... \n\nMy friend got her food on a separate ticket, and awhile went by, and I still had not received mine.  It took a little longer than usual, but I figured it was because they were so slammed.  A few minutes later, the girl who took my order came out and saw my number was still on the table.  She asked if I had gotten my food yet, and I said no, and she apologized and said she'd be right back.  Then Bryan Haas (I'm guessing he was the manager at the time), came out with our food, apologizing.  Long story short - I received AWESOME customer service from the Local Taco staff, and Bryan Haas especially.  They comp'd our food for the delay, and gave a gift card to return as well.    I told him the gift card wasn't necessary, but he insisted. Bryan also slipped his business card in there, which I thought was very professional and sincere.\n\n  I just wanted to give a shout out to one of my favorite restaurants and the all-star staff that works there.  Going above and beyond for your customers is what makes everyone love Local Taco so much :)  Thanks!  And see y'all soon!",

Yep. Food. \n\nShe continued on with what she was doing: the grueling task of flipping tortillas on a grill. I full expected the woman's head to twist a complete 360 degrees, a trick I once saw in the movie \"The Exorcist\".

  "text": "What can I say about my experience with Eric at One Stop Guitar?  I bought a Groupon (or Deal Chicken) years ago in hopes of picking up a new hobby and I came across Eric.  I bought some personal lessons on a whim for really cheap as for something to do on off nights. At the time (building has since been torn down and rebuilt) the shop was an awesome little studio right downtown and open late in the evening to work around my busy schedule. I couldnt have been more impressed with Eric's level of knowledge and the actual art of teaching students how to play the guitar.  I even continued going to see Eric after the 5 sessions were used because he made guitar learning fun!  You can probably learn how to play a guitar online, I changed an car alternator from a video on youtube, but you'll be miserable without some personal guidance from the best guitarist in town.  Eric's an absolute stud, he loves what he does and it shows. Young or old, give him a look!",

We also had these weird hush puppy looking things that were topped with tobacco infused powdered sugar. They called it a bignet but it wasn't the kind of bignet I imagined. Anyway, it was interesting and yummy. \n\nWe sat at the bar. Fantastic service!! Wish I could remember the lady's name. It was this week so whoever the bartender was on Tuesday.

Their food is overpriced compared to other \"Healthy food\" places. Even With the sales it is sometimes not even worth it. The produce also gets old quickly and I can find the same items they carry here at publix for the same or even less.

I always end up driving to Whole Foods :-/ Every time I try to do my grocery shopping here I always end up having to go to other stores to find what I need for the week. I can't say that I have been able to come here and fully shop for the week and feel like I got the best deal. \n\nThe only time I come here is for specific items like the enlightened ice creams because they carry almost all of the flavors.

This restaurant was right across from the venue and a perfect place to grab a bite before getting in line for the show. \n\nOur waitress was incredibly nice and was very quick to check on us and take our order.\n\nWe shared a 12\" thin crust with bacon and ricotta and it may have been one of the best pizzas we both have had. \n\nOnly weird thing was the fact that their was absolutely no lighting in the bathroom. This only mattered a wee bit because my friend and I tried to reaply a little bit of make up before heading to the concert.

It is really convenient that you can sit at the counter and get waited on there.\n\nService:  The staff was upbeat and pleasant.  They were the ones who recommended we sit at the counter, which was a really nice experience.  We didn't feel rushed to get out of our seats.  It was really great that they offer you a sample of the food if you are unsure.\n\nFood:  Overall very good.  I was hoping for a bit more spice and strong flavors, but it seems like it is made marketable for the general population.  Which worked out fine with me because there were seasonings available on the counter to bump up the flavor profile.  I got the etouffee and bread pudding.  The etouffee was good, but the flavor got a little muddled after eating it for a while.  It didn't have the depth of flavor that I was hoping for.  The bread pudding was super delicious!  I would recommend it to anyone needing a sweet fix.  My friend enjoyed her jambalaya.\n\nOverall:  I would certainly come back.  The convenient location, good service, and yummy food are all definite pluses.  I am not sure that it is the best New Orleans place in Philly, but I am happy to partake of the menu again sometime soon.",

It's just so lovely on a nice sunny morning. \n\nCame here on a Saturday with the bf. we ordered a brunch special which came with french toast, scrambled eggs & 2 pieces of bacon. We also ordered the roast beef sandwich. The french toast was delicious! It almost reminded me of the bread pudding. The only problem... it wasn't big enough!!! If I wasn't being conservative I could have eaten that portion of french toast in 2 bites. Not joking. It was good but not sure if it was worth like $7. The roast beef sandwich however was AMAZING! Boar's head never gets old. There was also some kind of chutney in the sandwich which is what made it pretty tasty in my opinion. And the sandwich was only like $6 and came with fruit. \n\nSuch a cute brunch spot. I would absolutely return!",

This Embassy Suites is not like most Embassy Suites as it does not have the center atrium.  The hotel is a standard high rise building.  \n\nBad - Parking at this hotel is a challenge.  They have a small garage and the parking spots are very small with extremely tight turns.  If you want to prevent getting your doors dinged, don't park in the garage.  Also, there is no elevator in the multi-story parking garage.  So plan on dragging your luggage up and down several flights of stairs. \n\nGood - As with all Embassy Suites they put out a good breakfast spread with cooked-to-order eggs, omelettes and pancakes.  Also, the employees at this hotel are very friendly.\n\nIn summary, I find the parking situation to be unacceptable and I will choose a different hotel when returning to Tampa.",

Crab cake , not much crab was lukewarm and mushy, scallops undercooked and fish overlooked and dry. Nothing was hot.  Not going back anytime soon\nServer was very nice though.",

  "text": "Came in at 6:30 pm on Labor Day for dinner on my way home.  We were sat almost instantly and greeted kindly by one of the managers.  Our server was also very friendly and efficient.  In all fairness, it wasn't overly busy, but still there were other customers around.  The menu was great and the food was as well.  The calamari appetizer was wonderful.  My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly to temp.  Salad was very nice as well.  Hubby's seafood platter was pretty nice but he said the fish-n-chips (fish) portion had a different taste, coming off as a little strange to him from what was expected.  Mostly he enjoyed the meal though and was not complaining...only answered me when asked.   The cocktail sauce here is quite tasty as well.   As usual, the Claim Jumper restaurant is beatiful inside and out.    Overall,  we were very pleased with the whole experience.",

  "text": "Let me start by saying the oysters are wonderful.  The rest of our meal, not so much.  Our second dish was the Pate of Louisiana Rabbit and Chicken Livers.  Flavor was nice but it was served icy cold, so the true  flavor could not come through.  The compotes served with the pate were wonderful, a great compliment.  Our entrees were the Steak and Frites and the Braised Lamb with Fresh Herbed Pasta.  The steak was perfectly cooked and well seasoned, the fries were limp and greasy.  The herbed pasta dish was interesting but there were only two tiny pieces of lamb, must have been less than 2 oz of meat in this dish.  Our total bill, with a $40 bottle of wine and two cocktails was over $170.  Poor value for inconsistent food.\nPlease note that our server, Chi, was knowledgeable, efficient and delightful.",

  "text": "I decided it was finally time to get my eyebrows waxed, as I've been putting it off and putting it off for years. I began looking around at other reviews for local salons and Salon L'Etoile had gotten rave reviews about their waxing and brow shaping services. I made an appointment and was lucky enough to get one for the same day, later that afternoon with Ashley. There were two women at the front desk who greeted me as I arrived. Both ladies were very pleasant and one escorted me up to the second floor waiting room. She spoke about the other services they provide. \n\nThe waiting room is dimly lit and their is soft music playing throughout. I think they accidentally double booked Ashley, as I waited 15-20 minutes, which wasn't that big a deal (in my opinion). Ashley met me and brought me into the treatment room, where she also had music playing. She asked me what I was looking for and walked me through the process. She got to work right away and even asked if the temperature of the wax was OK. She also filled my brows in with a pencil before letting me see the finished look. I am very happy with my brows. She listened when I said I didn't want them too thin and she didn't try to change my look. I will definitely be returning in 5 weeks and will recommend to friends in the area.",

  "text": "It kills me to give only three stars,  but it's really just my fondness of days gone by that keeps me from giving only two. \n\nUpside:  They have great bar food and the best beer selection around.  It's a friendly place and the crowd is always un-stuffy and everyone is having a good time.  They've got a fantastic outdoor area, and the staff is generally pretty pleasant. \n\nThe kickers:  This was my long-time local go-to.  I used to frequent at least a couple times a week hitting happy hour during the week,  and brunch or drinks over the weekend with friends, to the point this place has been known as my \"cheers\".  However,  I'm not sure if it's new management or what,  but over the past year or two,  the service has gone down hill. WAAAAY downhill.   You'll sometimes for for 20\"+ before anyone even approaches you for an order,  and even sitting or standing at the bar,  the bartenders have become pros at standing with their back to the bar and not paying attention or getting your order for at least 5-10\".  The food is still good,  but they used to NAIL IT every time on the burger however you ordered it.  The last several times,  everyone got WELL done,  regardless of order.  \n\nI still go here,  and keep hoping every time that the service quality will return,  but unfortunately the area has exploded so it's always busy,  and I think they just no longer give a rip since they pack the place no matter how crappy service and wait times and food consistency gets. \n\nLuckily,  with the area booming,  there are several other great places now rights across the street and down just a couple blocks. \n\nSummary:  If you're lucky enough to hit this place when it's dead,  don't miss it. If it's slammed,  you're better off across the street at Beer Pale if service matters to you.",

  "text": "I've never had to write a review based on horrendous service/hospitality alone, but I've also never felt so humiliated as I did when I visited Wings Over Broadway for the first time the other night.\n\nI was really looking forward to trying this place since people rave about how good the wings are and the great Tuesday night specials. I was coming from work so I arrived a few minutes after my party. The restaurant was half-empty when I arrived and there was no one waiting in line, so I went to my friends' table where their food had just arrived. That's when I was informed by the waitress that I couldn't sit down.\n\nThe manager came over and explained the policy of \"no add-ons\" to a table, and the waitress offered me one of the (many) empty tables, where I would be \"allowed\" to sit BY MYSELF, as if I was some kind of pariah. My friends were aghast and we explained that we'd never been to Wings before, and they would never have invited me if they'd known I wouldn't be allowed to join them.\n\nI said I understood the policy for busy nights, and in the future we'd certainly abide by it, but since there was no one waiting for a table it couldn't hurt for me to sit down.\n\nThen the owner came over and very rudely said, \"Fine, you can sit down. But you have to pay full price for wings, no special for you.\" He and the manager were glaring at me, totally unsympathetic. I've never felt so insulted, and never before experienced this sort of treatment from a restaurant. It pretty much ruined my day.\n\nTo the owner of Wings: I was the nicely-dressed young lady that you turned away, and I'll be telling everyone I know how you made me feel and to avoid your establishment in the future.",

I had the oven on so as to pop it in there if it was cool- and it was, but we tried it both out of the box, and after a min on a 500 degree pizza stone. Much better off the stone, but still- nothing special at all. The skinny sticks are just pizza crust, no sauce, with cheese.. and unfortunately they came all stuck together  in a jumble. Since the crust was no great shakes, the sticks weren't any better. Food taste alone- sadly the better frozen pies can surpass these guys. Maybe with some time they can tweak what they are doing- they have great ideas going- just need to get a much better product out the door. I really, really had high hopes that they'd be great (their website sells it so well), so it was a big letdown that they were sub-average.",

Got a good deal through TripAdvisor using Booking.com . When we arrived, we were told that the hotel upgraded our room. Turns out to be a large room with huge king bed on the 18th floor with a corner view. Spectacular! Everything was clean, modern and lovely, and the sheets and comforters and pillows were incredibly comfortable. Room was very quiet we heard only the slightest noise from the binging of the elevator and the slamming of doors by our neighbors.\nParking was easy, if a bit pricey, but worth the convenience. Great service on check-in from valet parking to assistance with luggage to checkin to assistance with luggage to our room. Concierge was extremely helpful arranging for a dinner reservation at short notice. \nWe did not use the bar which looked great, particularly if you are a Bourbon lover. \nLobby area is stunning, with renovated marble and a safe from its former incarnation as a bank. \nPerfect location, a block from Reading Terminal Market and access to all the attractions of center city Philadelphia.",

I went a few years ago and each stop was a bar, so we really really enjoyed ourselves ha. My second time, 2 of the 4 stops were at the circle then the WWII monument. Not that it wasn't interesting, it seemed kind disrespectful drinking at the  war monument, and when we were there it was Memorial Day weekend so all the flags were up. I felt kind of uncomfortable. I like the fact we do get to bring our own drinks and peddle and drink, wish we stopped at more bars like we did my first go around. But it's still fun! Hopefully they rethink the WWII monument, but besides that it's reasonably priced a fun afternoon. Parking wise was also different than my first time. We met at a bar instead of where they launch the handlebars. Wish they were more specific on where to park or where you can park. Some of us paid for parking and others didn't. Kind of all over the place regarding parking. But once again, very fun and I suggest trying it out!",

The only issue I had was the guy taking my order he needs to be retrained as I asked for my sandwich and for my French Onion soup after that he told me the total without even allow me to get a drink. After giving me my total I asked for a bottle water, he seemed bothered that he had add something else to my order. The guy just seemed like he didn't want to be there, he is someone who I would want to interact with my customers. I didn't get his name but I added a picture on here",

  "text": "I was fortunate to come across this lovely place! As a sushi lover, I've always been apprehensive about sushi burritos because it sounds like too much rice and not enough variety. I was very wrong. The sushi burrito is perfection. It is the perfect lunch because it's fresh and light. The serving size is plentiful and the ingredients are very fresh. \n\nIt is set up like a chipotle and you pick what ingredients you would like. I would recommend adding a topping with some crunch like wonton crisps because it really adds to the overall texture. The tuna is definitely my favorite! Overall, it's an awesome lunch spot. Highly recommend.",

  "text": "It is sad but seemingly true that this place has survived for years on the overflow traffic from some of the other places at John's Pass. Tired of the wait at Bubba Gump? Not in the mood for pizza from Delosa's? Just realized that you paid for parking and that Walt'z has closed for the day - plus your feet hurt from a day at the beach ... stop for a while at Sculley's and take what they serve you. If you can find a server, that is. \n\nActually, the service isn't that bad ... the problem is with the layout of the place. The shops here want to have an eclectic air, as though they were built from driftwood and shipping crates held together with sail cloth and rope. This is fine in fantasy, but in reality does not make it easy for the wait staff to get around easily of remain within eye sight of their tables. \n\nThe food is passable, but unexceptional. Being a stone throw away from Gulf of Mexico means that a restaurant can lean towards basic tourist fare (they likely won't know how boring it is) and get away with it. Locals tend to shy away from such places, unless they are entertaining out-of-townees who believe boat drinks and breezes are more important than fine dining.",

  "text": "I typically only write reviews for excellent service and like to say I try to see the best in people. However our experience at shelter compelled me to share my experience.\n\nWe reserved an hour for bowling to celebrate a birthday.  By the time the hour was up, we had 4 people yet to finish their 10th frame.  This was perfectly fine. I walked over and asked for a 5 minute extension even offering more money for the courteous extension to finish our round.  I was then directed to the bartender who said he would do this, great!  While we waited for our match to come back online, someone came over and told my me and my fiancee to get off our seats because another group was coming. Of course we don't mind moving and sharing space once the other group gets there but there was aggression in his tone.  I assumed this man was just a sour person from the next group, but I later discovered he was actually the owner rudely telling us to move our rear ends.\n\nAfter several minutes our scores disappeared, and I went to check in on the extra time still thinking this should be a simple fix and in good spirits.  I was told by the person I originally asked that he was too busy and that I should have talked to him when it first happened (this is the same person I initially talked to who redirected me to the bartended) because our scores are gone. He then redirected me to the owner who irritably said you're scores are gone, you can buy another hour if you want.  After I began to become upset, he backtracked and then offered 5 minutes but our scores  were still gone and his tone was still \"get out of my face, I don't care\"\n\nI understand mistakes happen and that's not the reason for my negative review.  Customer service was non existent. My entire party felt like a nuisance and not a customer.  The owner should be the pinnacle for customer service, but I have little doubt he is a reason that shelter has a limited lifespan.  It's a shame because it is a beautiful bar.",

  "text": "One of the best burgers I've ever had! Village Whiskey has high-quality meat, great preparation, and awesome sides -- it's my favorite burger place in downtown Philly. \n\nThe aioli and fries are delicious, too. Last time I tried truffled cauliflower; I'm not usually a huge fan of picked foods, but it was fantastic! The cauliflowers and carrots were crispy, and the juice had a light but very tasty flavor. I would definitely order it again. \n\nThe one catch: it is pretty expensive. Probably place you would go to for an especially fun or nice meal, but might not be able to afford each week. \n\nThe decor is cozy and up-scale, with small round tables surrounded by tall couches to sit on. You can hang up your coat when you enter the door, and the hostess stands behind a large wooden whiskey barrel. It's a small restaurant, so it's better for dinner with a few friends or a date than large groups. The waiters are very friendly and attentive, and service is quick. All in all, a very pleasant dining experience!",

Out table got the Christmas beer, white lager, hard cider and milk chocolate beers. All of which were great! The white lager was excellent! Wish I would have had a second. \nI ordered the burger and potato wedges. This has to be one of the best burgers in the Lou. \nFamilies were there so don't worry about that.

  "text": "What a fantabulous date night with my favorite hometown chica at Il Giardino :-)  I was stoked about trying out this Italian restaurant for a while now because I had not yet been completely satisfied with my meal at any of the other Italian restaurants (chain or not) I've been to...and Il Giardino seemed like the hidden gem of Springhouse as it is tucked away in one of many shopping centers on that side of Bethlehem Pike.\n\nLike Bacco, Il Giardino specializes in pizza (actually, I have yet to try Bacco's pizza, so stay tuned!), so it was time for the ultimate test:  how does its white pizza play out?  Was I setting myself up for utter disappointment, or was I going to be enlightened?  White pizza is not exactly the most complicated-looking pizza around, but I only know of one other place that makes a few versions of it spectacularly (Top Tomato in Philly!!!).  \n\nAs serendipity would have it,  I received two pizzas on this date night: one which I had ordered (prochuitto gourmet pizza) and the other that was free (Il Giardino white gourmet pizza) because the free one was apparently sent to my table by accident -- yay!!!  It was a wonderful surprise, because the pizza was fantastic.  The white pizza that eventually came out for me was also very delicious and is definitely in my top 3.  \n\nThe atmosphere, I must add, feels intimate not just because it was small (I would say that it's 1/10 the size of The Olive Garden) but because on this Thursday date night, there were people who were enjoying themselves around their respective dinner tables like families, even if they really weren't in the same family.",

  "text": "I've been staying at this hotel for about four weeks (on work assignment in Trenton) and it's definitely one of the most modern hotels I've stayed in. The rooms are nicely appointed and the bed is amazingly comfortable. \n\nIt's a really popular spot for business travelers and it's definitely seen a lot of hard use. That's why I can't give it five stars, because their facilities people don't seem to keep the rooms in fantastic condition nor do the housekeepers do a lot of the 'little things' (like dusting/cleaning the top of the enormous shower heads or making sure all the drawers are flushed and leveled) that set other places apart.\n\nThe breakfasts are okay, for what they are... it's not the Ritz Carlton or W.A., so anyone who gripes about the food needs to lower their expectations a little. The coffee is kind of horrible but that's okay b/c there's a Starbucks in the lobby of the Courtyard across the street or one exit up in Ewing. I knew what I was getting (having stayed in other extended-stay type hotels) when I booked my stays and I was not surprised.\n\nAll in all, it's the favorite hotel of my team and we'll continue staying here when we're on assignment in Trenton.\n\nTips:\n\n-East Sushi and Palermo's Pizza are two really good delivery places nearby and the front desk folks will give you menus.\n-Metro Grill is a fairly good sit-down place nearby.\n-Masa 8 is a very good sushi joint about two exits up.\n-Mikonos (Greek) is iffy, probably should avoid it.\n-Buy your beer and wine at the liquor store one exit up (it's in the same shopping center with the Starbucks, plus there's a supermarket there too)... $6/bottle for a Sam Adams is a little steep.\n-There's also a really good Italian place in that shopping center - Piccolo Trattoria.\n-They have a huge gas grill on the patio at this hotel... another team from my company has done a lot of grilling here, so if you're going to be at the element for a while with a team, it's a great way to hang out and have dinner together.\n-If the lobby music is making you crazy, ask them to turn it down or off... especially later on in the evening if you happen to be in the lobby.",

The dumpling dough is perfectly chewy and excellent as far as thickness.  The filling I thought was a little under seasoned, but when I rolled it around in the Chili Oil, it was quite tasty.\n\nI also had the burger, which I thought was an unusual item to have on the menu for a noodle bar, but thought it would be interesting to try.  The burger is on more of a denser bread than a typical bun, and the mustard greens and acidic sauces worked great together.  The burger had a lot of Eastern flavors, but was still a burger, a well cooked one, at that.  Enjoyed a quick tasty lunch for 12 bucks.  As the temperatures rise this summer, I'll probably try the cold noodles and I think the ramen is calling for me this winter.",

  "text": "It's located somewhat incongruously in South Philly, which is more known for Italian, Mexican, and cheesesteaks.\n\nThe gun club is divided up into two floors. The main floor contains ammo, pistols, revolvers, rifles, and shotguns of varying calibers and gauges  for either rent and/or sale. In addition they also have gun related accessories, including laser scopes, loaders and such. \n\nThe back part of the main floor has a waiting room where you can hang out until your number comes up as displayed by a digital LED sign above the door. They have some vending machines for drinks and snacks, and a TV if you want to be entertained while you wait.\n\nThe range is upstairs.You can get ear protection and safety glasses if you haven't brought them. They have instructors who will instruct and help you learn how to shoot if its your first time. I was impressed by both instructors I saw. They were pretty thorough without using a lot of jargon and they were very personable. The older instructor that I saw was really nice and very encouraging to his students.\n\nThe range itself is very clean and well maintained. Any problems with the target marker was taken care of fast. And they have employees circulating around so if there is someone who isn't acting safe, they identify and correct bad habits before anything can happen. \n\nYou can buy targets and ammo for a fairly decent price, considering its a range. They do tend to stick to Federal ammo, which isn't the cheapest. But, it also doesn't tend to jam like some of the cheaper stuff. The rates for non-members isn't too bad, though it would probably pay to become a member if you are going to go more than one or two times.\n\nMy only gripe, and its a minor one is that it gets really jammed with people on the weekends. So the earlier you go, the better.\n\nThe people that run this really make it what it is, a fun place to enjoy yourself in a clean and safe environment.",

  "text": "THE GOOD: great food for a decent price.  We got the $65 oyster platter which came with 12 huge and succulent oysters, about a dozen each of clams and mussels, 10-12 tails of jumbo shrimp, about half of a huge king crab, 2 small sauce cups of ceviche, and 3 different sauces including a malt vinegar, cocktail sauce, and a spicy mayonnaise dipping sauce, as well as multiple wedges of lemon.  The platter was huge and probably could have fed 3-4 people, though I was able to eat most of it with some help from the fiancee.  The oysters were fresh and delicious and were the star of the platter, while the crab was the not seasoned and somewhat bland compared to the rest of the platter.  Of note, I liked the shrimp as they were steamed with a spicy cajun seasoning which was a nice Louisiana touch.\n\nWe also ordered the fried oyster, bacon, romaine lettuce, and avocado salad which was decent.  The fried oysters on the salad were perfectly prepared, though the bacon was thick cut and a bit on the tough/chewy side (i prefer bacon in a salad to be crispy).\n\nTHE BAD: Service was horrible.  I think we got the worst server in the restaurant; here's the breakdown: His appearance--his long hair made me think he should have been in an 80's hair metal band instead of serving in a moderately upscale seafood restaurant.  His service--inattentive: 1. he never introduced himself before taking our order, 2. he didn't allow us to finish our order as after we ordered our oyster platter he took our menus and walked away and I had to get another waiter/server to order a salad that we wanted to come with our oyster platter, 3.  He forgot our bread, and we didn't realize we were supposed to get bread until halfway through our meal when we saw other tables getting bread, 4. We asked him for lemon with our water and he forgot after multiple queries, and we actually asked 3 different waiter/waitresses/servers for lemon and they all forgot, though our main waiter eventually remembered and brought the lemon to us in the middle of our meal.  The final straw in this terrible haystack was his apathy and rude demeanor at the end of our meal--after taking my credit card and charging for the meal, he walked by our table and threw the credit card/receipt pad so that it plopped on our table and said \"here you go\" and continued walking away like he didn't care.  Overall, it seemed like he did not really care for his job and was there just going through the motions.  I was surprised that a restaurant of Luke's stature hired a waiter like this, as with an appropriate waiter and appropriate service, this meal would have been phenomenal.  Unfortuntely, the service left us in a sour mood despite the quality of the food.  If the service would have matched the food, Luke would have deserved a 4 or 5 stars in my mind, but because of the poor service we received, I gave the restaurant 2/5 stars.",

Amazing classic cocktails - we had a Sazerac, a Ramos gin fizz, milk punch, and he had some Absinthe (not my taste).  The other bar staff all agree that Paul is very exacting about his cocktails - the right preparation, glass, garnish, presentation.  We had the Oysters Rockefeller for a snack, really delicious - four perfectly fried oysters on a dish of spinach with cheese, served with fresh bread.

  "text": "Love the fact that you can access this place through the mall and it's garage. The interior looks more or less like an old library... takes us old folks back to our college days... nicely done... floating bookshelf over the bar... \n\nI wasn't overly impressed with the cocktail choices, I've been so spoiled lately from the vast collection of craft cocktails around town, so I just stuck to water. \n\nAs I generally do drag my meet-up group with me, we had a table of 14 and this poor kid had to take care of all of us by himself. He got a little help when the main dishes came out, but other than that he was on his own. They even seated another table in his section. They knew we were coming, so I would say understaffed. Our waiter tried his hardest and he ran all night, but service could have been better had he gotten a bit more help or at least not be seated more tables. \n\nAnyway, let's get to the food. We often share dishes, so I had quite a few samples and here is my verdict:\n\nBeer cheese tater tots: absolutely delicious, big portion, must have for any tater, cheese and/or bacon fan.. it hits all those areas.\n\nFried cauliflower: fantastic dish, also quite a portion, delicately breaded cauliflower fried to a crisp, tender but not mushy inside and served with an interesting ranch sauce.\n\nFried avocado: I was suspicious I must admit, but it turned out nice... not as big a portion as the other dishes, but nicely done. Coated avocados, deep fried, nice outer crunch, creamy middle, served with a grilled lime and a special ranch sauce... trickle some lime juice on the avocado and dip it in the ranch... omg good.\n\nShishito peppers: guess that's the new fad...basically roasted peppers... not as exciting as it may sound. The little sesame dip that came with it brought  most of the flavor for this dish. Lots of peppers though. \n\nChilaquilles: seemed to be a nacho type creation with lots of chicken and cheese. Not bad, but I wouldn't go out of my for this dish, somewhat bland. big portion though.\n\nFrench Fries: not worth it\n\nTater Tots: absolutely delicious\n\nOnion rings: meh\n\nCucumber tomato salad: wonderful, large portion, nice vinaigrette, not overpowering, wonderfully light fresh salad. highly recommend giving it a try. \n\nMac and cheese: good stuff\n\nDoctorate burger: overrated and deemed not worthy of the price tag.\n\nDouble Major: good, but in my opinion was overdone and a bit dry.\n\nFrench burger: a very drippy cheesy affair, nicely done though.\n\nOverall I would say it's an ok burger spot. On the pricey side, but good for an occasional outing. I probably would just eat all the apps and sides because they were well worth it.",

  "text": "The Blind Tiger is tucked in near some antique shops in Ybor City, unassuming to the eye walking by it save its awesome sign (of a blind tiger, of course) painted on the window. The interior is warm and inviting and the focus is on coffee, tea, and fresh baked goods with some clothing and homewares also for sale. What really impressed me however was that there is as much emphasis on the tea as the coffee: too often at coffeehouses tea is simply an afterthought and nothing more. Not here. There are about six selections of tea and they roughly cover the gamut of black, oolong, and green teas you'd hope to find. The coffee I had was very good and the baked goods include such favorites as banana bread, cakes, and cinnamon rolls--the latter apparently being what Blind Tiger is most known for locally. \n\nOverall it's a very neat little place and the interior is one which makes you feel no expense was spared to create a haven from the loudness and bustle of Ybor City, where it seems every other business is a bar or club. As much as I love bars, it's great to have a place that provides a degree of quiet and serenity.",

Frenchman Street is where the music is. I highly recommend Three Muses, which is a gastropub on the street. The food is incredible. The mac and cheese is amazing. The cheese it uses is great and the dish comes out sizzling hot. Once I started eating it, I could not stop till I finished it. I have the dish ranked as good as any mac and cheese I have tried. It is in a tie with Beechers (locations in New York and Seattle). The pork belly and \"Banh mi\" Gulf Fish Tacos are excellent. The lamb sliders and sweet potato gnocchi with Louisiana crab are very good too.\n\nOf course, Three Muses also has live jazz performances. The music is fantastic. I arrived at the gastropub ten minutes before it opened so I could get a seat at the bar immediately. It was a Sunday night and it still got busy for dinner in a hurry.\n\nIf you are visiting New Orleans and looking for recommendations, feel free to message me through Yelp and I can share my itinerary, which includes my Yelp reviews.

  "text": "Can I first confess that while I'm a Top Chef fan, I'm mistakenly thought Kevin Gillespie was Kevin Sbraga? Imagine my surprise when I sat down to my New Year's Eve meal and I saw a brown bear instead of a ginger bear.\n\nI've been excited to know a Top Chef winner has opened up a restaurant a few blocks down my place but I haven't gone for months because I felt somewhat intimidated. The price is of course a little higher and I've always had a distaste for restaurant that only offers taste and not fulfillment. So when it was a few days before X'mas and the few restaurant newsletter ever so \"gently\" reminded me that the New Year's Eve dinner is actually a big deal, I started soul searching for a restaurant that I always wanted to try but haven't had a chance to do so, my mind landed on Sbraga.\n\nThe place has the very same decor that the hipper restaurants in Philly and New York favors, walls lined with wood planks, the very urban wood cabin feel. Silver and black balloons filled up the ceiling for NYE, the place was packed with people. \n\nOn New Year's Eve, they offered a 4-course champagne menu. While it is nice, it's 3-times more expensive with no selection whatsoever and I'm a light-weight drinker, and it was early and I like to choose, so we opted for the regular four-course menu.\n\nI indulged in the rich and surprisingly sweet Foie Gras Soup. It's velvety, almost like a sabayon. For the second course, I had the Sea Bream which I recommend the dish wholeheartedly. The Sea Bream has a really crispy skin, the fish is well cooked. The same can be said about the piece of pork belly in the dish. I also love the squid ink sauce and the calamari \"noodles\". Love it. would eat it again, would even try to make it in my own kitchen. For the third course, I had the fettucine with the perfectly cooked 62 degrees egg. the egg is indeed perfectly cooked, but it's not much different from a pasta carbonara. Maybe even less, since the amount of pasta is little and the dish is recommended to be mixed up, the pasta to egg sauce ratio is a little out of whack. The whole dish is a little more \"decomposed\" than I like it to be. The churro/coffee creme brulee is a nice finish to the meal. \n\nI wish that the whole meal is more filling, but at the end it wasn't too bad. Me and my friend was debating whether we wanted a sandwich after the meal, but it was fine. Service was good, our server is charming even though he spilled some water. I had a Sbraga Punch which to me tasted very much like cough syrup and he had no problem switching it to the Bell Hop for me which was quite unique and pleasant. Being sat right next to the kitchen also has its perks, other than being right in Sbraga's face, occasionally you'll hear they yell \"Service!\" which it's almost like they're putting on a show for you before you hear it enough and you wonder whether they are having problems with their wait staff. The couple next to us were obviously not a Top Chef fan, since their waitress told them that she'll \"relay their compliments to Kevin\" and they were murmuring to themselves that they had no idea who Kevin was.\n\nWill I go back? I would probably, if a friend hasn't been and suggest to go. Personally, I still like to have a meal that fills me up, especially if I have to pay almost $100 per person.",

  "text": "I've been here a handful of times, and bagels have always been delicious. I visited the shop on 5/19/18, and this will be my last visit. I went there because I was hungry and in need of food, but it seemed like I walked into the middle of classic P.T. Barnum show: clowns juggling while riding unicycles and elephants parading around on their hind legs. The first employee I interacted with, at the \"bulk\" bagel counter, didn't hesitate to let me know that I was attempting to order from the wrong location. Fair enough. They did have a sign on the counter, but it wasn't as conspicuous as an \"order here\" sign that dangles from the ceiling. Her tone made it clear to me that I had already committed one transgression. I then order from the attendant at the POS. I clarified my complicated order of a breakfast sandwich and two toasted everything bagels with a tomato and garlic cream cheese, three times. The first clarification was that I wanted everything bagels, not plain. The second  clarification was directed toward me because they actually have garlic and herb cream cheese, not garlic cream cheese. The third was my reiteration of the tomato and the quantity of the said bagels. At this point I had more confidence in a drunk ESL Uber driver getting me home safely than my order being prepared as per my request. After waiting for my extravagant order to be prepared to imperfection and gazing at the yellow ceiling grid with stalactites of black dust, my name was called and the first employee I interacted with hastily handed me my bagel bag. On the ride home I asked my partner in crime to ensure that there were 3 bagels in the bag because they probably \"F-ed\" the order up. He assured me that the quantity was correct. When I got home, I feverishly ripped open the wrapping on the two everything bagels, like a joyous child on Christmas Day, only to find     that the bagels had the tomatoes omitted and the cream cheese barely exceeded a skim coat. The breakfast sandwich was anemic at best with barely any protein on it. I am so glad that I expected disappointment. Honestly I'm not too upset because closer to my house there is a new bagel shop: Red House bagels, where the staff is courteous, the shop is cleaner, and the bagels a bit larger. Red House is my new bagel stop.  Sorry Newtown Bagel Co, you've been replaced. Although your actual bagels are slightly better tasting, it is not enough to reconcile the pain points associated with your operations. My words of advice, replace (don't clean) your ceiling tiles and clean the filth from the grid. Having almost 10 years of food and beverage experience, I would hate to see what your walk-in and floors behind the counter look like. Coach your employees on courteous service, or maybe treat them better and they might pass that on to your patrons. Oh and maybe write the orders down before entering them into the POS, because sometimes those machines aren't as navigable for some operators. I'd like to keep going on about this, but I am probably beating an already abused P.T. Barnum animal.",

Apparently not!\n\nI've been coming here longer than any other liquor store in the area, believe it or not from the check ins! Prior to becoming nutty about the suds, I was in love with New Jersey wines. Wine Works was my standard spot for Valenzano, Heritage, Sharrott, etc.\n\nI stopped in yesterday afternoon since it was right on my way home from the shore area. All the usual vino suspects are still well-stocked on the shelves, but I headed straight for the beer.\n\nFirst off: Check the dates. Some of the beers are dusty, and that's a bit disconcerting depending on the style.\n\nSecond: Make your own six-pack. I do this whenever possible in general, and they do have a nice selection here. Much larger than Wegmans, smaller than Total Wine, and maybe on par with Canal's, depending on the location.\n\nAlso check out their large format bottles. I was surprised to find Transmitter Brewing in stock. Transmitter is a tiny brewery on Long Island City. Like, super tiny. Like, only a few people can comfortably fit in their tasting area at a time. Definitely try their stuff if you see it and like your beer on the funky side.\n\nCheck out is always efficient. Obviously be prepared to present your ID if you're anything like me and could pass for a 19-year-old.\n\nProbably the best part of Wine Works? Very reasonable prices. My 6-pack of pretty good stuff came out to $14...aka the price I've paid for one beer on draft on a few occasions.",

It has to with the shady business practices of this establishment. We come to this restaurant on a regular basis. My issue is, lately every time we come here they try to price gouge us. Most times when I order a certain menu item, they charge me the lunch price because I order a smaller portion. Depending on the day and the server, the price changes every time. Most recently I ordered only a child's cheese quesadilla, nothing else. I was charged full price for an entire kids meal. I was told when I questioned it that the \"manager\" made him charge me that way. Also on a separate occasion we were way overcharged for margaritas. This issue is now happening so frequently, that I refuse to return.

  "text": "My first visit to Calypso a few weeks ago after hearing about it from a friend.  A co-worker and I decided to try the Friday buffet which is seafood centric.   We had the arroz con pollo and shredded brisket; they were both full of flavor.  The brisket is best when dipped in the Guasacaca (avocado based salsa) which lends a brightness to the rich brisket.   After, we tried the seafood paella which was full of seafood and sausage.    Everything was tasty, though the buffet suffers some due to the lack of traffic as the temperature on some dishes wasn't ideal.  This is anecdotal, but deserves mentioning.  \n\nWe did speak with the owner after eating and he shared his background.  He couldn't have been nicer, and did allow us to try a few items off the day's menu (the empandas are not to be missed).   Calypso is a great addition to River Ridge, but helps fill the hole of Latin cuisine in the entire metro area.  I can't wait to get back and try more of the menu!\n\nETA: I went back for lunch today and everything was hot and fresh.  I'm guessing my previous concern has been addressed.  Food was excellent again.",

  "text": "Meeting a friend's significant other for the first time can be a very traumitizing experience.  You want it to go perfectly.  You want them to love you and think you're funny and nice and will want to continue to have you around.  Especially when its your best friend from college, and its her husband of 8 months. \n\nNow before you all go thinking \"man Michelle's a bad friend!\"  I have met him twice... for a total of 5 minutes... once drunk at a tailgate and then in the recieving line at the wedding.  Its just that every time i came to visit them, he had other stuff going on so i never got to hang out.  But this time, I was hanging out with him and was determined to make a good impression.  \n\nThe only problem... my friend knows WAY too much about me :)  And knew that when she said, \"I'll get a drink if you have one\", i would get the sangria.  Which was delicious!   Different, but highly delicious...as was her mai tai.   Then was the pressure to order the \"Bloomin Onion\".  Which is awesome, but greasy and gross, but still amazing.  But not something i want this guy i've never met to see me chow down on!  \n\nAnd rather than ordering a steak, which i really was not in the mood for, i opted for the \"Bloomin Burger\".  MORE BLOOMIN ONIONS!   The burger was thick and juicy and perfectly cooked.  It was topped with cheese and bloomin onions!  Very good.   It came with fries, but i was so full i couldn't even finish them.  \n\nWe almost ordered the \"chocolate thunder from down under\" for desert, but i think my friends husband was concerned about his own chocolate thunder from down under!  \n\nThe food was good and we called ahead and got on the waiting list to be seated at 715, yet we were seated at 6:50, so that was nice.  I felt like i was going to explode when i left.   And while it may not have been the best first impression food, it was definitely an authentic Michelle meal.",

  "text": "Food is great, drinks are great, deals are great (Brunch with 2-4-1 drinks? Heck yeah!). The menu is extensive and interesting, with unique twists on classic dishes. The service is also great, but I am withholding a fifth star due to the management's seating policies.\n\nWe came for brunch on a Sunday expecting an hour plus wait, so when the hostess informed us it would be 1hr45m we weren't surprised. However, we became frustrated when we noticed there were 4 open tables on the patio that still hadn't been seated after an hour of waiting. It was a beautiful day so we asked the hostess about it and she said that the tables were reserved. When we asked again, she explained that the patio tables were not assigned to a specific server but were instead added on to a server's load inside, so they weren't seating them because they didn't want to overwhelm the servers. Totally understandable to not want to overwork your servers, but why not seat people with the caveat that service will be slower? Or better yet, why not specifically assign a server to the outdoor section so that wait times will be lower? Having worked in the service industry, our group was confused by this. We ended up just sitting at one of the empty patio tables until the hostess notified us that a table was ready. \n\nWe ordered the Cheddar Biscuit, the Wood Fire Double Yokes, and a Turkey Feta Omelette from the specials board and all were delicious. The biscuit comes in a trio and though it doesn't look like a lot of food they are VERY filling. Our server surprised us with a side of White Trash Hash on the house because our food was taking longer than expected (we didn't even notice the timing, so it was a very nice gesture). The White Trash Hash is a must, this stuff is addicting! Potatoes, rice, and gooey cheese- who could ask for more.\n\nOverall, great place for brunch in Nashville. Expect a long line but food worth the wait. Hopefully management can improve their seating policies to cut down on wait times in the future.",

  "text": "My wife and I came here for dessert on a busy Friday night. Frost has a really big selection of Gelato flavors - maybe 20 or so - and an assortment of sorbets. My wife settled on pistachio and amaretto. Both were really good, but I think the pistachio was a bit better. \n\nWhile the flavors of gelato were quite good, I have to agree with Brenner T.'s review that says that Allegro is a better quality product than Frost. If you compare the gelato here to the same flavor at Allegro, it will lose. But Frost's strength is the variety - many more flavors than Allegro. And the gelato here is still quite good - a solid 4 stars. But I wouldn't take an Italian here looking for authentic stracciatella gelato. \n\nFrost also benefits from its location - next door to two very popular restaurants - Sauce Pizza and Wine, and Wildflower. It's a great spot for some light dessert after a meal.",

  "text": "I came to Philly for a weekend trip with my bf, and remembered how great Marrakesh was from years ago with my parents.  It's still down a dark alley off of South Street and in a house (the owners' house) Things have slightly changed- Marrakesh is still dim, and served as a 5-course eat-with-your-hands dinner family style, (as if in Morocco)  surrounded by tons of Middle Eastern decor- runs, lamps, the works. The servers are the owners- a couple who loves to keep it traditional. \n\nI called ahead for seating at 8pm but it seems as though we could have just walked in- we ate upstairs.  You have to ring the bell to get in. We came on Sunday but it was relatively busy- downstairs was full but upstairs not so much. Maybe it was because we were upstairs...but I felt service lacked a bit (we had to ask for water a few times, etc but I couldn't hold it against the one server- the wife). On Fri and Sat, there are belly dancers. \n\nIf you're new to this kind of thing, they do a good job explaining the process. First, they ran your hands through soapy water from their majestic-looking teapot. Next, they explain the menu and ask you to choose between 1 or 2 course for dishes 3 and 4. You don't have a lot of flexibility.. so I am not sure how vegetarians would fare. \n\nWe ate:\n\n1) Course 1- three salads: picked carrots, cucumbers and an eggplant puree- like a babaganoush. This was very tender, salty and good- the others were not as fancy but very tasty. A large tangine looking thing comes around for you to grab pita. The pita is ok- it's not warm, it's not fluffy but you can't win them all (and it's important not to fill up too much on this)\n\n2) Course 2- Very interesting kind of Moroccan...quiche? It's basically a flaky pastry topped with confectioner's sugar that houses egg, chicken, nuts...and some other things. It was overwhelmingly eggy, but tasty. Not my favorite dish but had to give it points for creativity and uniqueness.  The flaky dough was delish- very similar to that of the Green Spinach Pie.\n\n3) Course 3- was our choice between two chicken (chicken with lemon olive oil or spicy cumin)- of course we did spicy cumin! It was fall right off the bone- so tender as I'm sure it was slow cooked for hours. It's also half a chicken so you get the breast, thigh and wing. The sauce was not too spicy, I thought, but the cumin flavor is smoky and present. The sauce is pretty slathered across the meat- and yes you can refill up on pita if you're not into eating meat solo. \n\n4) Course 4- is a choice between beef or lamb and since I don't do red meat, I passed on this. My bf ordered the lamb though and said it was very tender and yummy- and sweet. It was topped with almonds and something else that made it sweet. \n\n5) Course 5- Dessert!  You get fresh fruit and baklava (one piece each). Usually I think baklava is too sweet for me but this one was pretty good- and not too oily. I mean, yes, it was very oily but it wasn't like...drenched in oil. It was pretty flat, cripsy and full of that nutty goodness that you make baklava. Bf said it wasn't nutty enough for him. Again, the flaky dough wins. \n\nThe fresh fruit was also a plus- except our apple was bruised so we didn't eat that. We took our orange for breakfast the next day. There were two strawberries (not really regional, ha) and giant seedless grapes that were almost frozen because it the fruit platter came with a chunk of ice. This was almost like a cornucopia..they really do make you feel like emperor and empress haha!\n\nThe meal is well paced (slow) so you have time to breathe.  They sell only a few house wines by the glass; otherwise you get it by the bottle (there are a few varieties at $30 ish, as well as liquor and the like). My bf got two glasses of red wine- the burgandy. It was actually fruity and full of body, which was a plus. I ordered the traditional rose drink which I actually wouldn't recommend- it was really, really sweet. It was like rose syrup (sweet enough), with sugar and water..it was too sweet and at $5, I was upset I couldn't finish it. \n\nThis place accepts cash only and is $25 per person. I feel the menu could get old since you don't have variety but it's definitely a must-try while in Philly.",

The lunch menu, a mere two pages, seemed a bit limited. I ordered a meatball ricotta sandwich with salad, while my dad had a chicken Parmesan sandwich with homemade Parmesan fried potato chips. The salad was very fresh, with nice greens and homemade dressing. The potatoes, not quite as crisp as ordinary potato chips, were quite good. The meatballs were well above average, nicely seasoned and with generous but not overwhelming cheese. The chicken Parm looked rather flat, and my Dad did not finish it, proclaiming it \"not for me.\" We finished up with Spumoni, very prettily presented with slivered almonds and a light drizzle of strawberry sauce.

  "text": "My expectations were fairly high for this place and ultimately I left somewhat disappointed (and $200 less in my wallet). What you are really paying for is the view here. While we didn't lay down a $200 deposit to guarantee a window seat, we did get one. I think this was because we ate so early on a Sat evening (5:30pm reservations). We were seated on the West side and the sun was setting. Fortunately I had my sunglasses with me although they did offer to pull down the shades for me as well. The views were definitely lovely but it likely would have been better had we gone later in the evening when the lights of the city were coming alive. \n\nService was excellent throughout the entire meal. Our waitress took good care of my wife who is gluten free. We asked her what a few of the roads/bridges were that we were looking at, but she sort of guessed at it. You would thinking working there they would be required to know the more major landmarks out there. Oh well.\n\nAs for the food, that's what left me disappointed. I started with the Steakhouse Salad. I guess I just assumed there would be some meat in it, but sadly, there was none to be found. There were quite a few olives in there and unfortunately I'm not an olive fan, so ultimately I wasn't able to finish the salad. My wife's roasted shrimp though wasn't bad. For our entrees, she went with the Salmon while I had the Filet and Shortrib Duo. In the end, it was pretty good but it certainly didn't wow me or anything. I've had better meals and other restaurants in the city. At least the evening ended on a more positive note with dessert. My Lemon Tart was delicious and you can tell they have a pastry chef on site. Not many gluten free options for my wife, so she just had sorbet.",

  "text": "We boarded the Carnival dream in New Orleans. If everything works out good we're going to Belize, Mexico and Honduras. We booked the trip about a month ago and this is her first time at sea during the Christmas holiday.\n\nSunday, Day 1 - Our room was a mess! The windows were so dirty my wife decided to clean them off herself. The chairs were covered in salt and when you sat on them the salt transferred on to your clothing. Then after walking in and out of the room we noticed that salt and dirt was tracking in to the room. We finally called  down to the front desk and they sent someone up to clean it off. We hold gold cards so that means we sailed at least 25 days but less then 75 and never have I've seen such a dirty ship. Dinner was OK, we are in the cafeteria not the dining room. The kids had pizza and I had chicken, again dinner was OK. \n\nMonday, Day 2 - The weather was nice so we played in the pool, kicked back in the Adult only area and I drank as much as possible. A big BBQ lunch out on the lanai deck with Ocean views! Dinner was an absolute disaster. It was formal night and it took us over an hour to get our food. There was six of us at the table and our ribs were cold and the corn was burnt. The pasta was not very good,how do you screw up pasta. Just about everything felt and tasted like it's been sitting for a long time. We complained but zero customer service!! The comedy club was awesome. Also, midnight room service was good. BLT's and cookies!! \n\nTuesday, Day 3 - another day at sea where we did the same thing we did the day before. The BBQ again was awesome. Pools were fun and we played cards inside and listen to all the trivia games because it got a little windy outside. I was hoping to avoid any negativity today but I have to tell you breakfast absolutely sucked. The eggs were very runny, the French toast was BAD and the eggs Benedict was not very good. Other then that it was a fun day at see. We ended the night at the comedy club and it was so much fun!\n\nWednesday, Day 4 - we arrive at an island off the coast of Hunderus and it was beautiful. The town where the ship parks is very pretty from the ship, however, you soon find out that the area they drop you in is owned by Carnival. Everything is for rent, everything is for sale and everything to me feels FAKE! The sand, the trees, the buildings and even the food. My kid said that the french fries were the same as the ones on the ship. So here is what you do!! Get a cab to the West end of the island. You will see most of the island driving there. The best snorkeling is on the West end and there is plenty to see and do. We got back on the boat, took lots of pictures and had dinner again back in the dinning room. Again it was disappointing and we said that tonight is the last night. The staff is not good, the food is bad and we are extremely disappointed. We're talking 3 generations of people, Grandparents, parents and kids that are 9 & 17. Carnival if your listing, you have a problem. Keep in mind people I was on another ship two weeks ago. The food was great!! So we ended the night watching a movie out by the pool on the big screen and it was awesome!!\n\nThursday, Day 5 - We arrived in Belize and there are a lot of fun things to do. If you can't snorkel, take the kids to Old Belize, check out the picks, the place was great!!  Dinner in the dinning room again! The food was really good tonight but the service was really slow. Comedy club after dinner was fun and a little piano bar to top everything off.\n\nFriday, Day 6 - Cozumel Mexico was a blast. We got off the boat early and we were one of the last ones on. Dinner in the dinning room again just sucked. This boat is just too big for the food and service to be as good as other ships I've been on. We watched a movie outside under the stars and enjoyed our last night with warm weather. \n\nSaturday, Day 7 - Day at sea, BBQ on the Lani deck again was great. Trivia, corn hole and another movie on the big screen under the stars. No dinning room tonight, it sucks we have to tip them. I discovered that the chicken quesadillas that room service offers may be the best I've ever had. Our bags are already outside and we are ready to disembark.  \n\nThe big ships are fun but service is sacrificed. What really sucks is that Carnival does not have the roads or the channels in place for a guests complaint to get heard by a person that has the ability to make a change. Policies and procedures are in place and rarely does change occur. This was my 4th cruise and my least favorite by far. The destinations were great, the ship was beautiful and the employees for the most part will bend over backwards for you.",

The tortilla soup that I ordered was piping hot which is HUGE, as it seems like there is an epidemic going around of lukewarm/underheated food. While I waited for it to cool, I sampled the garden salad that my dining companion ordered. For a side salad, the portion was generous. The balsamic vinaigrette was tasty and an elevated alternative to the usual oil and vinegar dressing. The coffee drinks looked inventive as well. For add ons, I recommend the Billy Goat Chips. One also can't go wrong with one of the chocolate-chip cookies (all of the baked goods and desserts are made in house).",

  "text": "This was a fun place to visit for a light dinner and some great entertainment with the kiddies! We caught a band called Washboard Rodeo, and they played some fun bluegrassy-type western swing. We'd made a 7:30 reservation via Open Table and were seated immediately. It's a small place, so any table you get is a good one. This is one of the few places on Frenchman Street that seems okay for children: mine are 9 and 11 and very capable of behaving well in a gastropub setting. The menu has a great baked mac & cheese and the waitresses are warm and welcoming. I have to say, after sampling the fish tacos, I sorta wish that I had ordered the mac & cheese, too! The tacos were okay but small and pretty bland. The mac & cheese was plentiful and well-seasoned. But this place is all about the music and the drinks, and on these they won me over. Had a simple Stella Artois apple cider (despite the great drink selection) and hubby enjoyed his porter. If you make a reservation, they give you 90 minutes to dine, which to me was more than enough. The band starts at 7pm on a weeknight, taking a 15-minute break around 8pm, and our 7:30 reservation gave us plenty of time to enjoy the music. If you visit New Orleans with older kiddies, I'd say give this place a go.",

  "text": "There were quite a few reasons why I could not give Cheu a five-star rating but it does not include the food. First, Cheu is a small location. There are only three tables crammed into a small nook which should onlyt. Second, VERY limited seating. Therefore, this place does not offer reservations, except in extreme cases, and seating it fills up fast. \n\nHowever, the food does come out at a fast rate so I cannot see why anyone would want to eat, relax and talk for a bit. The noise level is rather loud and the music does not help in that aspect. \n\nBesides those little annoyances, Cheu does offer delicious ramen that is worth the wait and crammed area. The secret lies in their small menu that is precise and allows to make ramen a specialty. I tasted ramen from other restaurants and the menus tend to be huge; lots of combinations, food seems rushed and put together; but not here. \n\nThe slices of brisket in my ramen was lean and non-fatty and the broth was absolutely delicious. Cheu does offer apps as well but you can feel up on the ramen alone; but if you must try an appetizer try the Garlic Wings or/and the Pizza Dumplings.\n\nBack to the ramen! I added an soft boiled egg that perfectly complemented the noodles and a Spiked Juice w/ Rum to top it off. Although the noodle bar is pricey the tasty and satisfying dishes makes it worth the investment",

It was more than enough for a meal but could have been split in two. The chicken was juicy and well cooked, but if you like spicy food you will need to add more hot sauce. The sides were also well made. I was interested in trying the bourbon whipped sweet potato but I'm glad I didn't. A friend had ordered it but didn't finish it because she said it wasn't good. I tried a bit of it and completely agreed. Idk if it was the bourbon or lack of seasoning but it just was not good. I usually will make plain sweet potatoes at home, boiled or baked, with a little salt and pepper and they have more flavor then this dish had. Other than that, what I enjoyed my meal.

  "text": "This practice is amazing! The place is very nice and clean and such an efficient use of space. It is not a large office, but it doesn't need to be. And I really enjoyed their use of technology... I love the online portal , appointment making and online forms/resources. Even better is they have you sign in, take a photo and fill out your profile on a tablet. I also appreciated the automated email and text I received to remind me about my appointment. All of it made me feel that I was in a place with quality equipment and that valued having good technology.\n\nAnd all the staff are amazing from Nina at the front desk to Dr. Jeremy himself. They are personable and go out of their way to explain everything to you and make sure you are comfortable, educated and having a pleasant experience. It is very down to earth and not intimidating.\n\nThe best is that I have only had one appointment and my back is so much better.  I could feel instant relief and pressure disappear. I also appreciated Dr Jeremy's communication throughout the appointment. He always let me know what he was finding and how/when he was going to do the adjustment. I can't wait for my next appointment.",

  "text": "In a nutshell:  These guys are awesome to deal with.  They came on time;  They worked their butts off until the job was done;  They were very tidy and considerate of my property; and I got exactly what was promised at a fair price.\n\nThe Details:  When my A/C went on a hot summer day I thought ugh, I wish I knew someone in the field.  I didn't, so I started reading reviews and calling around.  The main HVAC repair companies around town came across as contractors (middlemen) that would just end up costing me more money in the end.  I knew what I wanted.  I wanted to deal directly with the guy who was going to do the work.  Someone who cared about customer satisfaction.  Someone I could trust.  I found all those things and more when I spoke to Ray, the owner and operator of Trust Home Comfort.\n\nWhen I read some of the reviews on the competition, it seemed that the biggest frustration out there were people who were charged a couple hundred of dollars to get a guy out, only to be told that their old A/C was not worth repairing.  I didn't want that to happen to me, so I took the unorthodox approach of taking a brief video of my problem and posting it to YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iMHhimCqUo .  This will be great, I thought.  Saves everyone time, and hopefully me some money.  Right?\n\nWishful thinking, none of the big companies were even willing to look at the video.  So I kept calling around.  Eventually, I got a hold of Van (the office guy) at Trust Home Comfort.  He was great!  He said \"Sure, we'll have a look at the video\", so I emailed him the link with some photos of my system.  I heard back a short time later from the owner of the company, Ray, who is a journeyman HVAC technician with a 4 year degree in Refrigeration Technology.  Ray told me straight up that he didn't think the problem was what I was hoping it would be (a low cost contactor part), but in order to know for sure he would have to come out and run a diagnostic.  They both reassured me that if I had to replace the entire system, I wouldn't be charged for the service call AND a new system.\n\nWhen Ray (the owner/technician) arrived the next day he took his electronic meter measurements, and was able to confirm that my compressor was shot.  I would need a new system. We sat down to discussed my options.  Ray was very honest and forthright about which system would be best for me.  He took his time and shared his experience about what other customers have liked. No high pressure sales.  No lies about pricing.  Just the straight honest goods you would expect from a technician.  I loved that.  We ended up upgrading our HVAC system to one of the new units that is VERY quite and comes with a 10 year parts warranty.  I think my neighbor was especially pleased with the \"quite\" part.\n\nRay was even willing to do the job on a long weekend, even though he planned on taking it off.\n\nAt the end of the day, we got a new \"Green\" A/C unit, a new updated humidifier, and a new WiFi thermostat which I can control from anywhere in the world through my iPhone.  All for a very reasonable price.  Very cool.  Literally!\n\n(My daughter's comment about this review:  \"Why don't you write a book\".)",

He then went back to taking orders where he used his arm and same hand to wipe his nose, sniffed, and touched his hair. I cannot tell you how disgusted I was as it made me look to other areas of sanitation lapses as well.  \n\nThank you.",

I think we saw our waiter a total of 3 times the entire evening. We were never greeted after we were seated. We had to ask the Maitre'd if we could get some water and he could not have been more rude and offended that we had asked. Once we finally ordered, we were out of water. After asking for more water three separate times it finally arrived. And from that point until after we received our food, we never saw our waiter again. I asked the bus boy for another glass of wine which never came. Finally the waiter brought it over after we had finished our meal and when I told him I didn't want it any more, he gave me attitude saying he had just seen the ticket. Not my problem! We were never asked if we wanted dessert, we were just presented the check at which point our waiter told us we didn't need to leave a tip since we were clearly displeased with our experience. As if he was going to get a tip in the first place. Getting tipped requires providing a service which he hardly did. I would say, don't expect a lot from this mediocre Italian place.",

He had been before and gotten the pork belly bánh mì but this was my first time.\n\nWe split an order of the fried egg rolls + each got a bánh mì. The soups looked tempting but the bowls were so big! He got another pork belly bánh mì and I got the grilled pork. Since the sandwiches were cut in half we shared those too so each of us could have both flavors. We liked them both but agreed the grilled pork, which does have a brown sauce of some sort, was better.\n\nAfterward I wanted something sweet so I ordered a strawberry smoothie to go. I asked for *some* bubbles because i wanted to try them but didn't want my drink full of them. Overall it was good but SUCH a sugar bomb.\n\nThe guy running the place was very nice, too. I asked him to explain what the condiments were on the table because they were labeled in Vietnamese, and of course he did. We didn't use fish sauce or hot sauce or vinegar but it's nice to know they're available.",

The toasted ravioli is also one-of-a-kind: not a cheese bomb like other places and extremely balanced in taste. They weren't stingy with the filling, either.

Who knew I would fall so in love with Lindsey and all girls there that I refuse to go anywhere else!! I highly highly recommend Salon Fiber to everyone! All the girls there do a amazing job! My family, friends and coworkers all go there now!! All great things to say!! Thank you all for always being so amazing and making my salon days perfect!!",

She was so bubbly and knowledgeable, and the time went by so fast.  We were thoroughly impressed.  Even with the larger size of the group we were still able to hear Bri and enjoy ourselves.  I would definitely go on a tour with this company and this guide again.\nSide note to Bri:  We did a taste test between Willie Mays and Popeye's and it was no contest!  Wille Mays won all the way!  Dooky Chase was right up there with Willie Mays.  Thank you again for a great tour.",

A long, deep and narrow venue with few tables; much reminiscent of Hanover Street in the Nahth End of Boston!\nThe store is immaculate and the help is uber friendly.\nWe got a simple Caprese salad that was divine, as was the bread served with it.\nThe 13\" Carne pizza was amazing!  Several types of meats, a bit of cheese and a scant dolep of red gravy on a dough pie that literally puffed up around the outside into an airy, slightly burnt crust.\nThe Owner, Mr. Scott Volpi was interacting with the customers as well as his staff.  He is a very personable young man! We wish him well!\nAs I told him on the way out, my only regret is that we didn't come up from SE AZ sooner; we've been missing A LOT!",

By all means a cheap dessert to split on a date for two if you want ice cream and don't mind a \"hole in the wall\" type of location.\n\nSerious cookie sits between a bar to the left and other shops in the right in a pink Clearwater downtown building.\n\nThe ice cream shop was not as kept as I believe it could have been and the gentleman running it was decent enough at greeting and explaining what he had left to offer us on a late Sunday night but didn't seem happy to be there to say the least. I wouldn't blame him. He's a grown man in an ice cream shop. Unless he's the owner.\n\nIce cream/cookie/hot fudge 4 stars! Needed more ice cream\n\nAtmosphere 2 stars.\n\nCustomer service 3 stars.\n\nUltimately I'd try another ice cream joint before revisiting this one :/",

I am soooo glad that we did, because we happened across Horn's. The delicious smell coming out the door drew us in straight away. We were greeted by very friendly staff, and quickly seated on the patio overlooking the beautiful homes in the neighborhood. I was glad to see that their menu had a very nice selection of different foods. I ended up with the \"Jewish coonass,\" which was absolutely AMAZING. The dish consisted of two potato latkes piled high with crawfish etoufee, each topped with a fried egg. I am craving it now!!!  My partner had the stuffed bell pepper and it was amazing as well. Very good prices, and also a good selection of craft cocktails as well. The next time we are in New Orleans (which I hope is soon) we will definitely be here again!!!",

The sauce was tasty and well seasoned.  It seemed like it had a hint of anchovies in the sauce.  Either that or garlic.  The wings were excellent top notch.  Very hot even though it was take out which was hard to do.  With several flavors to choose from we got the naked honey BBQ.  Thy were meaty and massive.  I def would return for the wings.  A good sign upon walking in were the empty boxes of liscios rolls outside.  The roll of course was fresh and soft while the chicken was chopped breast meat with a spicy hot sauce and Gorgonzola.

I imagine that you have to make reservations relatively early given the size of the place and popularity though.\n\nOrdered the Greek coffee for myself which was tiny (not sure if that's how it's supposed to be) but still tasty and unique with the coffee grounds in the cup. My friend ordered the Greek frappe which was creamy and delicious, will definitely get that next time. Got the Shakshouka which smelled amazing and was hearty and rich, especially since I opted for the additional sausage. Was pleasantly surprised by the peppery spiciness. My friend got the Cypress Breakfast which she said was delicious as well. Didn't take too long for the food to come overall but our server was very polite, updated us on food status and refilled our water regularly.\n\nWill definitely be back for the lunch options next time!",

I know, stupid me! My appointment was booked with Drea, the master stylist here. One look at my hair and she said I don't need to go the relaxer route. I just need some deep conditioning to hydrate my hair. I'm glad she just gave me good advice without trying to upsell treatments. The entire process took almost an hour and I just walked out of the salon with smooth nicely blow dried hair. Thanks Drea for understanding my attempt of reducing chemicals and unnecessarily stressing my hair.",

The Burrito was really good - I loved the blend of flavors! I enjoyed the Thai Ice Coffee too and appreciated that they have the option to put bubbles in it. The staff was also very friendly. \n\nThe only reason I gave this food truck 4 stars instead of 5 is because the wait to get food can be a little too long. I went here at around 1:30pm and had to wait about half an hour to get my food despite the fact that there were only 4-5 people in front of me in line. Will definitely go back there nonetheless!",

But the star of the show is always the fries. We usually get the Smack fries which are outstanding. Also a fan of the fried pickles. \n\nMisses so far have been the veggie quesadilla (bland and ordinary) and the spinach artichoke dip (pasty and again rather plain). \n\nTheir beer and drink selections are wonderful. \n\nOnly negatives in two visits is the sometimes slow staff (even when not busy) and old ass dilapidated parking lot.",

They serve lunch and dinner every day and on the weekends they have breakfast (sometimes a buffet).  They have a good selection of fruity tropical drinks and the menu has a Caribbean flare.  They have the best fish taco's I've ever eaten and use local fish.  Another favorite is the lobster quesadilla, huge chunks of lobster and you won't leave hungry even tho it is an app.  Conch fritters, chips and guac, all sorts of app's for sharing.  Black bean burger, turkey burger, cuban sandwhich . . . something for everyone from the veg head to the carnivore.  If you are looking for a unique salad try the Alfresco Salad with banana bread croutons, dried fruit and tasty dressing.  You can top with all sorts of things, but I like the scallops.  If you are downtown St Pete it is worth stopping by and they will validate your parking too.  Enjoy!",

The tall (6'6\"+) african-american bouncer kicked me out when I came out of the bathroom, after I had been there for only 2 songs, saying \"I need to talk to you outside\" then proceed to say \"girls are complaining you're dancing up on them\" I have a strict policy of NOT dancing up on girls or even initiating eye contact! (I have a firm opinion that most[not all] girls in clubs are attention whores, gold diggers and snobs - as such I do not go there for them! I go to have a good time enjoying the music). Obviously this accusation was complete BS. I can only assume the bouncers hater homies were not happy at all on the crowd of girls who circled up around me when I started getting down. I asked to speak to the manager who tried to pass off some BS excuses for his employees misbehavior and invited me back in, but my cab had already arrived to take me away from this POS, likewise I refused to come back into the club. The manager proceeded to tell me \"I don't care about Yelp or TripAdvisor reviews\" when I informed him I write online reviews  ... LOL! OK .. so what I have to say back here on the internet is: good luck bud. I won't be back & have a lovely career seeing as you don't understand the power of the internet! We yelpers stick together.  Piece of advice guy: don't let your employees play favorites with your patrons, I hope your club works out for the best... bon voyage!  I will spend my $$$,$$$.$$ (hint, hint) elsewhere like at the Push Ultra Lounge where I wont get discriminated against for being male, tall, white and cheered on by attractive females.  Sorry your bouncers homies cant dance to EDM (maybe they should go hang out at The Kennedy in Tampa - hehehe) & have a nice life!",

  "text": "I lived in Lincoln Green Apartments from September 2003 until June 2009.\n\n1. I changed my apartment within the Lincoln Green as the water from the yard had destroyed the wall. The wall was wet for 3-4 month and the management failed fix it regardless of multiple inquiries. Finally they offered me to move to another apartment and did not compensate for the time and moving expenses. They did not even decrease the rate of the new apartment at least to the rate that I had been paying for the old one. \n\n2. My expensive bicycle was stolen from the second floor balcony. All my attempts to ask for reasonable increased security in the community was useless. \n\n3. When my rent was over, I washed the carpets and had one of the office employees come to inspect the apartment and sign off on my lease termination. I had about 100 Dollars security deposit that I never received back and because of my busy schedule, I did not really care to follow. However, a few years after, I noticed a \"Collection Notice\" on my credit report. As I investigated that, I realized that the Lincoln Green Apartment had reported me to Collection Agency for what they said \"  150 Dollars fee for not washing the carpet\". They had never contacted me although they had my new address, email, and phone number. They reported me to collection agency for only 50 dollars. When I contacted them, I faced bunch of rude people with no respect, what so ever, to a customer. As soon as they realized that I am not looking for rent, they hung up the phone on me. \n\n4. If you walk (not jump) in your apartment or watch TV after 9 pm, don't be surprised to get a knock on the door by your neighbors. \n\nTwo of my friends who also lived in Lincoln Green Apartments had similar experience.\n\nI strongly discourage renting the Lincoln Green Apartments for the following reasons:\n\n\n1. Disrespectful and rude employees and managers\n2. Their abuse of having the SSN of the tenants.\n3. Their inadequate care for apartment issues\n4. Poor security. \n5. Very poor sound proofing of the walls which transmits every single sound to all neighbors. \n\nIf you have any question or concerns, please feel free to email me:\n\nKambiz\n\nkambizpa@yahoo.com",

People park in the fire lanes and clog up the aisles with their poor parking. A lot of this probably has to do with the fact that this place is the only grocery store for A LOT of people. The produce is unreliable, except they have a board by the front door that lists the local produce, which I LOVE, and use to buy as locally as possible. All other Rouse's don't have this, but they should. A few of the gentlemen that work in produce are helpful in answering questions about when items will return or where they are, etc. \n\nThe bakery grinds out new fresh bread every day, and most of it is really tasty. Warning, though, they don't list the nutritional information on the packages, so you might get something you don't want in your tummy..\n\nThey've recently added a \"natural\" section, which has organic and all natural food/beauty products. This makes me very happy, but I usually buy the Rouse's brand organic canned goods because they are cheaper. \n\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, this place serves as the sole provider of groceries to a lot of people. What that means to you is that on busy times (at like, 6 pm, or right before saints games..), it is so busy that you can't go in an aisle without smashing into someone, and it gets really frustrating. I try to go on \"off\" times and pray for the day when they re-open the store on Elysian Fields.",

No fuss.  They work to meet your needs.  Everything is a la cart so the costs add up but service and final product was well worth it.  My feet are ready for the Puerto Rico beaches. I just pulled off of 130 South because I saw their neon sign and boy am I glad I did!  I wouldn't change a thing!",

Number 1, they don't want to do it, but also, they don't know the menu or anything about the kitchen when you ask a question. This is a typical suburban blue collar and millennial underwhelming establishment to watch Sports in with a pint of flat Budweiser. It is perfect for blue collars who swear that walk in dressed like they just finished a 10 hr day either painting, fixing drains, or laying down planks, or up on a roof.

  "text": "In NOLA on business this week and had to make a stop here based on reviews and actually ended up stopping twice here during the week. Plus, this place was super close to our hotel so it made it a logical spot to dine.\n\nSince all of our meetings have been later in the day and catered, we are given lunch, but we have had to go on our own for breakfast/dinner each day. Tuesday was our first stop in at Café Beignet (311 Bourbon Street). To no surprise, this place was jam packed and we're guessing that most of these people here are tourists (after all, this is Bourbon Street and we are from out-of-town ourselves). \n\nAll of the menu items are less than $10 and are all very tasty. I had the Cajun Hashbrowns on Tuesday and loved them so much that I returned again this morning to have them again. The \"Southern Breakfast\" (eggs, grits, bacon and bread) also looks good, but the hashbrowns had me coming back for more. They are loaded with Andouille sausage, onions and peppers and served with a side of scrambled eggs and bread. \n\nHad never sampled a beignet (NO-style donut with powdered sugar) and ordered one to go with my breakfast. Then another. And a third. Holy cow, these things are addictive!\n\nThe coffee is good as well. Hey, we're from Minnesota and we like good, strong coffee. \n\nThere might be better places to get breakfast in the French Quarter but Café Beignet successfully filled our bellies during our stay in New Orleans. Thanks for the food and great service. If there is a line, it is WORTH the wait.",

  "text": "This is a review for pet grooming service. I went out of town and had to have my mom babysit my 3 years old westie, and she decided to shave his head bald because the hair was covering his eyes! I was mortified. He looked balder than a bald eagle (only the top half of his head was shaved and nothing else).... no westie should ever have that type of haircut. I can't ever imagine what would happen if I let her babysit my future kid. So I went online and booked an appointment with Katarina. She is amazing and wonderful in every way! Very friendly and patient. One of the best pet groomers there, I would highly recommend her because not only did she do a great job of trimming... what's left of my dog's facial hair but she also made him look super cute and clean.  I was very pleased with the outcome. Will definitely go back to her for future appointments!!!",

They had a sign about a cover charge at 8. They came over and said if we were still there at 8 eating we would be charged. The food was nothing special. It was about equal with Zattarans box foods. The shrimp they served in the jambalaya and gumbo could not be smaller. Service was lacking. They may want to look at improving the food and entertainment to fill their very empty establishment before they focus on a cover charge. To add the music was not worth the five and was not really jazz bar type. The bar was also cheaply done. If they do not change they will be gone in six months.  Hmmm trying to find a positive kids menu was decently priced.",

Nothing worse then half way through the meal and having nothing to wash it down with. Anyways, for the food I ordered a club sandwich and fries and he got the fish and chips. The sandwich was huge and delicious. On the other hand, the fries had very little taste and were not impressive at tall. Maybe they need some spice? I'm thinking next time I will try the kettle chips which aren't even home made so I am not sure they would be worth it. My boyfriend enjoyed his fish and chips but had the same opinion the fries. In conclusion, the main course is delicious but the fries are bland. We will definitely go again to try something different!",

When I think of eating at Anthony's, I start salivating.\n\nThey have an outdoor area with an indoor/outdoor bar separating the patio from the restaurant. \n\nMy go-to order at Anthony's Coal Fired is a large Proscuitto and Onion pizza with the proscuitto baked (they can either top the pizza with after it's cooked or bake the proscuitto with the rest of the pizza). The saltiness of the procsuitto mixed with the fresh parmesan cheese and sautéed onions is the perfect combination. We split this between two people and always have a slice or two left over for breakfast the next day. If we only have one slice leftover, watch out.. it's a race to see who gets the last piece first!\n\nLet's talk about the baked wings.... really, really, really good. I actually didn't get them for the first time last night and the first thing my boyfriend said to me was \"no wings?\". The wings are baked in the coal oven and have a great charcoal taste to them. They serve them with onions and focaccia bread which are equally as delicious.\n\nAside from the food being down right delicious, the service is always excellent for take out, dine in, or even if you're just sitting at the bar.",

You can get the same thing at Marsh for less. I was told the tour was great, but was disappointed when I had to self guide myself through there back room/ distillery. The equipment has the beginning look of the Statue of Liberty as the green sets in and equipment shows continual signs on not being cleaned. Patina is not cool in a distillery.

  "text": "This hotel is bad, borderline mediocre. Of course, the hotel remains in construction which is an inconvenience, but manageable. The front desk is located on the tenth floor which makes it difficult to get help quickly. Room floors are inaccessible without a room key in the elevator. This wouldn't be an issue had the keys actually worked half the time (we had to get 5 new room keys). The elevators come once per hour and are almost always full, so you might as well get some exercise and take the stairs. The pool seemed too vacant (probably because the \"front\" desk was right in front of it). The rooms were quaint as they served their purpose, a place to sleep. Definitely not luxurious, but towels/soap were always cleaned and replaced. Our AC unit was faulty and we had to call for the hotel engineers to be fixed, but it remained operational after. Overall, horrible service and facility, but the rooms themselves are adequate. Location's great, in the heart of the French Quarter. I'd only suggest staying here to save some money to spend on the delicious restaurants.",

Next time I'll do well done.\nMy first time here so I need to adjust my order temp on eggs and meat next time. \nLove the orange colored booths.

They even catered my brothers wedding years ago. \n\nWe love cuban food so try it often from several places and nothing ever compares the quality food and service you get from Liborios.  The food is always hot and taste amazing. The amount of food your get for the price is enough to feed 2. My husband often go and we get one large pressed cuban and one potato ball and one deviled crab and 2 drink. We share the cuban.  And on the way out we pick up one dinner and its plenty to feed 2 and have left over for lunch next day.  Just for over $5. \n\nThe Stuffed potato balls are amazing, the size of a grapefruit and have real ground hamburger inside with seasonings and green olives.  \n\nWe went to West Tampa Sandwich Shop on armenia today and had the worst experience and will never go back. The food and service can not compare to Liborios.  The stuffed potato balls are so small and I cant even tell you what the creamy meat (?) mixture was inside but can tell you Im pretty sure they are the exact same stuffed potato balls we get from Publix Deli.  \n\nKeep up the great service and awesome food Liborios.",

The pace of the meal was perfect long enough to digest and enjoy between courses.  The setting is beautiful it feels very retro with the old fans, tin roofs, and dark wood. The boudin noir was delicious. Followed by crawfish bisque with stuffed crawfish which taste perfectly seafoody with a hint of spices very subtle layered flavors. The Gumbo was also very good. I had beef short rib were tender but the presentation was a bit weak. The other meals were more of visual masterpieces. The crabmeat omelet was delicious and the home made fries were perfect.

  "text": "I have a few issues with this place regarding the quality of food for the high price. I would/should be giving it 2 stars based on the food alone, however, the service was so good to warrant a full star on that alone- & I evaluate a place based not only on the food but on the entire experience.\nSo, the food: if you have it on the menu, you better have it in the kitchen. They were missing a few things which was very disapponting. We shared the scallops which were the best part of the meal- but for $3.33/scallop it better be good. I settled for the salman which was nothing special (salmon is usually a fail safe for me, I always get it if nothing else jumps out at me on the menu- so I've had a lot of salmon throughtout my life.) It was accompanied by heavily peppered carrots & green beans and a \"root puree\" which was just a fancy way of saying mashed potatoes.... which was a tease because I was expecting sweet potato, parsnips or SOMETHING better than a root vegetable I am already fully aware of. Drinks were decent: my bf had a bourbon/cherry martini & I had my favorite- a dry, dirty grey goose martini. Hard to mess those up , though. Desserts were a puffed pastry that lacked any real flavor & a coconut creme brulee that was actually quite good- but just like a baked potato- is pretty hard to mess up. Like I said before- the one waitress that was manning the entire floor & bar did an exceptional job. She was friendly, thorough & attentive- she deserves a shout out.",

Just a few blocks away from State St., it is a bit quieter and less crowded.

Our Waitress, Rita who is amazing, had to make our drink order because the 1-Bartender was backed up. Staffing issues are hurting this place! It makes the experience bad for customers. The staff who are here have to work twice as hard, and still not enough to make the experience worth coming back! And at the end of our dinner, we tried to pay using the little computer that sits on every table. This machine would not accept our payment due to technical issues. The waitress even tried, and the people behind us and across from us had the same issue. The waitress went to get the acting Manager (female with dark hair) who upon having to come out to each table to get our credit cards, huffed and puffed, rolled her eyes, and yanked our credit cards from our hands and headed to the back area to run all payments. She came back and set all bills on each table, rather than hand them to all of us, with no apology, turned and walked away. I can honestly say she does not belong in a people business! Wow is all I can say! Will never be back!!!!!",

Tried Han Dynasty last night partly because it was recommended by the hotel as well as a couple that was in the elevator.\n\nInteresting that there were three noodle shops with 2 or 3 city blocks.  I really enjoyed the appetizers (dumplings in chili oil) and the entree (garlic chicken).  I know, I know, I was looking for noodles and ended up without.  I think this was mostly because as I was looking at the menu, plates kept going by me, steaming of fresh, Chinese wok flavors. I couldn't resist but to try a little of this and a little of that.\n\nMeal was hot, fresh, flavorful and an excellent recommendation.\n\nOn a down side, as I have noticed on this trip, the customer service, servers, waiters don't seem too excited to be working.

There were 3 of us and we all were so excited since it's our first time here. I ordered the Sweet Potato Pancakes with a side of hash brown. One of my friends ordered the Rash Berry Pancakes , which he complained was way too sweet. The other ordered Pig in the Blanket (pancake wrapped around a sausage), which she ended up eating the sausages only. The pancakes were very average and plain, definitely not as good as what people said it to be. Hash-browns were average also. Personally, I prefer hash-browns at Bongo Java. The portions are huge and I recommend sharing it with someone. \n\nFor that amount of waiting time and mediocre food, I wouldn't come back unless I'm around the area.

Like one other reviewer said I do stop at Trader Joe's  when I go do a major shopping trip because of their somewhat different produce selections and their wonderful whole wheat bread offerings.  \n\nI use a lot of nuts to try to stay healthy and I love the bulk department for those because I can buy them in large or small quantities at a low price. I also use many other products from this department: whole wheat pasta, dry beans and veggies, chips and the wonderful no sugar chocolates.\n\nIt was interesting when the store recently opened a fresh sushi bar. I, like many others, was very happy to see it. \n\nI dinged them one star because of the fact that if you are there at a busy evening you might find little kids running up and down the isles and playing Nerf football in the open areas.  Parents from this part of town who are doing their shopping should keep their children with them and under control.\n\nI actually prefer shopping at WinCo South as that problem does not seem to exist there.",

  "text": "Aside from the staff being super friendly, the food is quite tasty and the environment is super chill yet a little hectic at the same time but it somehow works. \n\nWhat I appreciated the most about Milktooth, is you can really tell the food is made with good quality ingredients. I definitely had my heart set on the Sweet Tea Chicken Fried Biscuit and was a little bummed to hear they were sold out. However, the little bear plate was simple, yet delicious and paired nicely with a side of savory whey grits. Also, the slow drip coffee is on point .\n\nOverall, Milktooth is a great addition to the Fletcher Place/Fountain Square area. I'm looking forward to spending many weekends at this place.",

Living in Seattle, we eat plenty of crab and seafood, so I immediately went for things we can't  get in the Pacific Northwest, which included 4 pints of Yuengling's, crab fries (fries with a wicked cheese/crab sauce), a cheesesteak, and lots of sports (witness the Sonics move to Oklahoma).  OK, this doesn't have quite the neighborhood charms of some of the classic Philly joints, but it sure is spacious, clean, efficient, and tasty.",

And the \"regular\" size is quite generous.  Don't come here if you'd prefer to pay a fortune for a coffee drink with a name you can't pronounce, and then sit at a table to drink it from a paper cup. This place makes you feel welcome to sit and take your time at a table looking out through the large glass front, at the crepe myrtle tree lined sidewalk and little globe lights on the front patio.  It's simply my favorite place in New Orleans to get my coffee zen on. (Oh, and they do great breakfast and lunch panini)",

In December, emails about fraud, theft, employees leaving started coming.  My husband and I had purchased, but didn't get to use yet, 10 classes each for $85.  The new owners wouldn't recognize the 10 classes, but we can each have $85 credit. I was told we had till the end of Feb to covert the credit to classes but the owner said I may want to wait, as she offers specials in February. \nI email this week about a deal they have for 5 classes for $47. I get an email back that I can't use the credits for special deals.  What???\nI just want to use my credits, and walk away. It doesn't seem to me that this place is fixed at all.\nThere are plenty of places in Philadelphia where I can work out and not have to worry about all this drama.\nThe workout is a 4-5 star.

You guys are lucky that I was starving and it was at least another 2 hours before my plane would even start boarding so one slice and drink set me back about 12 bucks.\n\nThe slice that I got was a combo which had sausage, onions, green peppers, and olives. They throw it in the oven for about a minute or two to heat it up. Not the best pizza but i have also had worse. The end crust was pretty thick almost to the point that it was a breadstick. I asked if I could get some pizza sauce on the side to dip it in and was ready to pay because hay, its the airport where they gouge you on pretty much everything. To my surprise, they didnt charge me. I guess nice workers do exist at airports. Unfortunately, this was the only positive highlight. \n\nOverall, I dont think I will eat at this place again any time soon. I can more than afford to lose a few pounds or 20. Put something with actual garlic on the menu and maybe we can talk about dining here.\n\nYelp 2016 Review #12 \"Vampires dont worry about this place. There's no garlic here\"\n585 overall",

  "text": "Met friends there for brunch on a Sunday. Boer fact day to chill on their expansive patio with some refreshing margaritas.  Staff was friendly and professional.  The atmosphere has a nice cool vibe to it.  Definitely a great addition to the Tampa food scene for an upscale Mexican restaurant.   Table side guacamole was well prepared, and came paired up with gluten free tortilla chips.  The added hot sauce was HOT.  I eat a lot of spice but this definitely brings the kick.   Food was generally good. Not outstanding but tasty and fresh. I had the carne Asada  tacos.  Definitely would revisit",

Briny, meaty, crispy and all of the qualities you look for in a good piece of fried chicken. \nLike many of NOLA's best restaurants, the interior is nothing special and the exterior is unassuming, but don't be put off.

The breakfast could be a bit better.  One morning they ran out of spoons.   The bacon looked funny... almost like it wasn't real bacon.   They were constantly running around trying to replenish something it was eggs or sausage or milk.  It just seemed a bit disorganized.   We would choose another place to stay if we visit again.   I can't be really negative, but I can't highly recommend this place either.  This is a very conflicted review.",

  "text": "I actually think the beignet here were better than Cafe Du Monde.  They were lighter and fluffier.  However, they were also WAAAAY bigger.  I'm fairly certain that one person should never eat three beignet at a sitting anyway, but the idea of eating three of these gives me sugar shock.  We split an order, and I still couldn't finish.\n\nThat's not really a complaint, though.  Just be aware that, if you're going for beignet, you should bring an appetite - and two friends.  Anyway, we stumbled across this little gem while we were wandering around the French Quarter, trying to figure out what we wanted to eat.  The atmosphere is wonderful - the Cafe sits at the back of an open courtyard, with tables (some under a patio), and on Friday night, there were musicians playing jazz.  The music carried well, without being so loud we couldn't carry on a conversation.  I believe if you went up the stairs, there was a bar up there (although, probably another establishment).  I'm tempted to give this place five stars for the atmosphere alone, but a restaurant is more than atmosphere.  It was a wonderful way to spend a Friday evening.\n\nOther than the beignet, the food was fine.  It was nothing spectacular, but I got a pretty good club, and my fiance got a pretty good roast beef po'boy.  My bread was a little stale - it happens.  It seemed like we had to wait an awfully long time for the beignet to come out.  I know they're fried fresh, but I've also made them before, and I know it doesn't take 15 minutes.  Overall, I had a great evening, and I would go back.",

  "text": "The low rating for this review is based on the women at the front desk, NOT my waxer Michelle. Michelle herself was great. She was friendly, fast and made getting a brazilian wax as pleasant as it could possibly be. She deserves 5 stars. \n\nNow the receptionists at this location are a whole other story. This was my first time at European Wax, so I was able to get my first wax for half off. I then bought a student package for $141 (buy 3 waxes, get 1 \"free\"). With the package each wax comes out to about $35. I paid for my services and left. After walking down the block, I looked at my receipt and saw that it was under another woman's name (Jessica). Essentially, instead of adding the package under my name, the receptionist had added it under the name of the woman who had paid right before me. I quickly returned to get this sorted out because I obviously didn't want to pay for a package for someone else. \n\nWhen I returned to fix this, the woman who had rung me up (I believe her name was Jhana Wilson) was rude and unapologetic. Instead of trying to rectify her error, she said they were really busy (there were 2 girls behind me in line) and wouldn't be able to handle this and I should return later. I told her that this was her mistake, and I would like it sorted out regardless of how busy they were. There was also another woman sitting at the front desk to help with other guests. I said I wasn't comfortable leaving with a receipt that was issued under someone else's name and no proof of payment for packages under my name. Jhana was visibly frustrated by my persistence and didn't seem to care to resolve the issue at all  - even though it was the result of her carelessness. Jhana also said the manager was unavailable to speak with me to resolve the issue and I should return in a few hours, or wait 24-48 hours to get a call from someone. \n\nBy chance, the manager (Alyssa) came out about 2 minutes later (so she wasn't unavailable after all?), and I was able to speak with her. Alyssa looked into the system and saw that Jessica's package (12 waxes) had been added to my account, and my package (4 waxes) had been added to Jessica's. She said she would need to file a form with corporate to swap our packages and it would take some time. I left the store with the issue unresolved. Thankfully within an hour I received a call from Alyssa saying she was able to resolve the issue and transfer my packages under my name. I appreciated that she had actually looked into the issue. That said, I was so turned off by the receptionist that I had to write this review. If I had not been persistent about getting this fixed, it would have gone unnoticed until either myself or Jessica came in for our next wax and realized our packages were all messed up. At that point, there would have been no way of knowing who our actual package had been issued to. \n\nI completely understand that mistakes happen, but giving customers attitude after a mistake should be unacceptable.",

  "text": "If you saw my pre Jazz Fest review, it was a 5 star.  This is my 2nd time staying here during Jazz Fest and this will absolutely be my last. \n\nI was extremely disappointed for several reasons this stay. \n\nFirst - the house keeping.  Words can't explain how lacking it was each day. They didn't replace soap or shampoo, they would leave the garbage, they wouldn't leave cream and sugar for the coffee even tho I left a note twice to please do so. I even asked for it when I saw one of the housekeepers and she said she would. \n\nBut the icing on the cake is when the sheets were soiled and I pulled all of them off to note they needed to be replaced.  We didn't arrive back until very late that night so exhausted I pull the cover back and they put the same dirty sheets back on.  In what world is this normal??  I stripped them for a purpose and it was obviously they needed replacing. I had to sleep on towels,  I was so upset with this. \n\nOur friends travelling with us on the same floor down the hall also mentioned their housekeeping was below subpar unfortunately. \n\nThe front desk was super unfriendly and the housekeeping just put the nail in the coffin for me. \n\nI will book elsewhere for Jazz Fest next time. \n\nPros:  I did request a room off Bourbon because last time was very loud late at night.  We were on the top floor in room 60 and it was very quiet back there. No elevator and no steps and no drunk people. \n\nLocation is very central. \n\nLounge is decent but I will review that separately.",

This thing is traditionally made from mixing rose syrup, vermicelli, sweet basil (sabza/takmaria) seeds, and pieces of jelly with milk, often topped off with a scoop of ice cream.\n\nSounds bizarre.

I walked in and was bouncing around from one dessert to another deciding if I should make a purchase. The employee offered me a sample of the banana puddings - definitely try some! And you know how sometimes when they give you so small of a sample to taste, you can't really make a proper judgment because there isn't enough to judge from? Not the case here!\n\nI got the salted caramel banana, the strawberry banana pudding and the upside pineapple cake.\n\nThoughts: OMG!! I never crave banana pudding and never really thought anything of the dessert. But man after this, I wanted to go home and make my own banana pudding (Although I highly doubt that I could make it half as good)! Their desserts are crafted perfect - three/four layers depending on what you get. The bottom layer the the pudding, second layer is the nilla wafers or they might even use some sort of pound cake(whatever it was - it was AMAZING), third layer, the strawberry and then the top layer is pudding with a nice whipped creme and topping. The creme has so much flavor and the texture is so smooth. Everything just comes together so nicely! \n\nThe upside pineapple cake was BOMB. the cake wasn't too fluffy but was dense to the perfect amount to Taste like what it's suppose to. The pineapple flavor isn't overwhelming but just right. My only problem was that the pineapple bottom got a little too carameliZed with brown sugar and was a bit hard to chew.\n\nDefinitely go to this place! I was so sad that there was no option to leave them a tip. (They use an iPad to ring you up). The service/help was so great and I would have left a tip but I had no cash. Any ways, highly recommend this place for desserts!!",

So I convinced my husband to do so. Here's how this 2nd chance went:: Absolutely wonderful. Chris asked that we let him know when we wanted to give the restaurant a second chance, but we decided not to. We didn't want any special attention. We wanted real unreviewed service.

  "text": "oh Millers, how i wanted to like you.  You are close to my house, have ample parking, and large spacious tables.  you even have a fireplace in the back for a little ambiance. \n\nfriends and i tried to come here 2 or 3 times for a quick/inexpensive* bite to eat and every time there was a 30-60 minute wait. we thought this must mean they are really good.  perhaps it just means that people in Springfield are willing to settle for a less than average dining experience.  *side note- this place is not inexpensive. \n\nhubby and i ordered apps- he got zinger boneless wings, and i got the guacamole. portion size was ENORMOUS on the guac - it could have served 8 people, seriously.  flavor was meh. apparently the wingz were good.  hard to tell what hubby enjoyed more, the wingz or the scantily dressed hostesses. \n\nour server was great, attentive and pleasant.  When something went wrong she did her best to fix it. That was much appreciated.   Side salad came out wilted and gross. management offered to take it off the check, would have rather had a decent salad in the first place but i digress.  Dinner was not very flavorful - at all - and portion sizes were okay. i got the quesadilla appetizer (which was plenty for an entree) but it was very sloppily put together and had no seasoning at all.  I have had food that is presented better and tastes better at fast food restaurants, where i am happy to pay $5 for a meal.  \n\nAt the end of the meal, i badly wanted dessert but didnt want to risk another poorly flavored dish.  Not to mention, all the dishes were like lunch tray plastic, and i felt that a $50-60 dinner for two was at least worth a nicer presentation. who knows, it may have even made up for the bland flavors. \n\nperhaps i was let down by the fact that there always seemed to be a wait and i had over hyped it in my head.  Never have i wanted to send back everything i ordered at a restaurant before this night.  i will never be back.  my husband says he will order the wings, but takeout only. no more dining in at this place.",

  "text": "After hearing about this place from a fellow Yelp Elite, my SO and I decided to try this place! We were warned of possible waiting times so came here on a Saturday around 10:45, and a line was already forming! \n\nFor apps, we ordered the takoyaki and fried octopus. The takoyaki are delicious-an order comes with 5 balls that were perfectly cooked and topped with sauces. Takoyaki are little circular doughs with squid in the middle, topped with sauces and squid flakes (?). I definitely recommend this app. As for the fried octopus, it was just fried without sauces on top and came with mayo on the side, but it didn't come with enough mayo to dip the octopus in.\n\nFor ramen, I got the red spicy tonkotsu ramen and my SO got the black garlic tonkotsu ramen. For both ramen, the thin noodles were mushy/overcooked and just didn't quite fit with the ramen. That was the flaw with the dishes, and it tasted like the noodles were overcooked in a pot of flour-y water so it wasn't as clean (which explains the mushy feeling). They should use more bouncy noodles for this.\n\nNow let's talk about the broth. The broth is flavorful, but the red chili broth was a bit too spicy for me and covered up the depth of the broth. I prefer the black garlic tonkotsu broth for that reason.\n\nOverall, delicious food and pricing is reasonable. The decor is very nice as well, but screaming kids that were running around didn't make our meal pleasant.",

Perhaps too hip for many over 35 but if you can tolerate the boisterous and extremely casually attired youth--I haven't worn a suit in 20 years either but even 20 year olds should have something besides skinny jeans and T-shirts with borderline obscene slogans in their closets--the food is worth it and the staff copes well.   \n\nI had a 6:00 reservation (obtained the day before) but the sky seemed threatening a downpour so I came early to avoid it and was seated 20 minutes or so before the appointed time.  I often don't even make reservations and have no trouble getting seated at popular places by being there when they open or, for those open all day, coming before the popular dinner hour, but that didn't work the day before at Lüke.  Even at 4:30 the place was packed so I did make one for the following day.\n\nMy meal started with the crispy Brussel Sprouts.  Even if you hate Brussels sprouts (I like them), don't be afraid to try this dish--if no one told you you might not know what you were eating.  They are in some sort of sweet/sour sauce/dressing and fried both slightly blackened and crispy as advertised . . . tossed with almond slices, small bits of jalapeño and sprinkled with shavings of cheese on top.\n\nThen I had pork schnitzel and \"pommes frites\" (that's shoestring fries to the Galliphobes).  It came with whitish gravy in a pitcher, I suppose to make it \"Southern\".  The gravy was good but I skipped eating it, doing that the usual way with a squeeze of lemon.  It was excellent and the fries were fine too.\n\nI finished with some excellent decaf and a glass of Kahlua--I had had iced tea with the meal so some alcohol was not an excess.\n\nA lady who was some sort of hostess dropped by my table while I was eating to make sure everything was OK and when told I needed ketchup (for the fries), went and got me some (in a dainty little single-serve Heinz bottle).  My waiter also checked several times but didn't hover.\n\nI am giving it 4 stars.  The 5th star is withheld because of the crowded dining room and noise level . . . nothing to do with the food which I greatly enjoyed.",

Honestly, there's not much going on up there and it was a bit warm, but we decided to stick it out. Everything on the menu looked great and I decided to get the Catfish Acadian, which is catfish topped with crawfish and sauce with a side of vegetables. My dad got the pork chop.\n\nMy dish was great! I have no idea what was in the sauce but it was delicious and it was a perfect pairing with the fish. The vegetables were also really good; they were nicely cooked and fresh. My dad wasn't overly blown away by his pork chop, so if you find yourself here you might want to stick to the seafood.\n\nBria was our waitress and she was wonderful! She was attentive, kept the fresh iced tea coming and she was extremely personable. She was probably the highlight of the visit.\n\nI'm not sure if I would go back.

Going through all sorts of life challenges can be painful and frightening when you know you're assumed to be a certain way.  Here, there are no assumptions.  They know who they're working with, and they are sensitive without the need to pry for information.  If you're in need of gynecology and you're not a woman, for example, they know exactly how to handle your needs while prioritizing respect for your identity.\n\nMy biggest concern is the physical space in which the Mazzoni Center clinic exists.  I feel sort of exposed in the waiting room.  I hope that they someday have the funds to upgrade to a larger, more private space.\n\nIf you visit during youth drop-in hours rather than making an appointment, you will probably wait a very long time to see someone.  This is completely understandable, in my opinion.  They'll advise you regarding what time you should show up if you call.\n\nOccasionally, I've noticed lapses in communication; I have been kept waiting in the exam room before with no one around and no idea how much longer I would have to wait.

  "text": "Just in Philadelphia for a couple of hours on a Saturday afternoon -- our first visit.  Wanted outdoor seating and chose RR because the tables seated 3.  Big mistake.  We were seated at about 1pm.  Drinks came pretty quickly and the server was very nice.  We ordered a Cheese Steak, Hot Roast Pork and a Rueben all with fries.  After an hour we started asking about our lunches; at one point the servers said that our order was about 1/2 prepared.  Wait. What?  An hour+ for three sandwiches?  They said they were slammed.  We could see three open tables outside and two other tables seated after us had already received food.  Lots of \"I'm sorries\" from the wait staff.  We insisted on a complimentary round of drinks (which they did agree to).\n\nWhen the food finally came, the Roast Pork sandwich and fries were completely cold (guess that was the half that was done on time).  The pork was fine, but the roll just average and the gravy was awful.  Fries, meh.  Cheese Steak filling looked like ground beef and was a miniscule portion in a large grinder roll.  The Rueben looked OK.\n\nWe should have checked reviews before sitting down, but it was getting late and we just wanted to catch a beer and a sandwich.",

It's a small location so there is an occasional wait, but the staff is great at turning tables and only accepting food orders as space becomes available for seating. I usually take visitors here when they want something casual but delicious. Definitely a good spot that locals frequent!",

You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  I love the cowboy burger, but my favorite is to share the seafood platter with my wife and child.  I one thing they don't have is soft shell crab.  Don't worry about dessert, you can have all the soft serve ice cream you want.   The fry is seasoned just right the potato wedges are heavenly done.

All of the appetizers were tempting, but my girlfriend and I decided to start with a plate of mushrooms and a 24 hour roasted squash. The chef later told us that the mushrooms had been recently gathered by forager in rural Pennsylvania who had to sleep out in his car for two nights. The effort was worth it, we really enjoyed.\n\nWe shared a middle course of slow cooked tuna and then moved onto a steak and a chicken for our main course. Overall, the food was probably the best I have ever had in Philadelphia.\n\nThe restaurant is small, but manages to feel cozy rather than cramped.

MexiCali has a number of great options.\n\nMany options here can be made vegan by holding the cheese. I absolutely adore the marinated tofu burrito. The tofu has a wonderfully chewy texture, and along with the black beans, the meal packs a protein-filled punch that will leave you full well past dinner-time, should you choose to finish it.  The sweet potato and plantain burrito is purportedly dairy-free, and it's another delicious, filling vegan option. The veggie tacos come with a spicier version of the sweet potato, the marinated tofu and some cabbage on doubled corn tortillas. The tacos are not as filling as the burritos, but they're a delicious lighter option. Finally, a fourth option for vegans: the guacamole burrito. They homemade guac is to-die-for delicious. \n\nI end up at MexiCali about once a week. I've been going since they were just a lunch truck 8 years back. There's often a line at the restaurant, but this place has been around for years and they have a great system to get you your burrito in a very timely manner.",

The best part I have to say was the dessert. We got cafe au lait panna cotta with mini glazed donuts, which reminded us of beignets at cafe du monde.

We purchased a LOT since we aren't able to make it up to Carmel much. We purchased a loaf of white bread, a cereal bar, peanut butter brownie, and nutter butter cookie sandwich.

They were there temporarily  but moved next to Fred Meyers for a more permanent placement .\n\nI really do admire Boise and the way its growing ethnically. :) Yay! Diversity in food in such a plus!\n\nOnce I herd about them opening a place like this, I was so excited because I LOOOOVE Vietnamese sandwiches back in San Diego.  I couldn't wait to try it here in, my new home. \n\nThey just opened 4 days ago and I highly do recommend giving this place a try if you want something new or different... The customer service is awesome and the lady that works there is very welcoming! She puts a smile on my face .  \n\nThey have sandwiches that are 12'  -- you can order just the sandwich or a combo that includes a fountain drink and a side of chips.\n\n[ Breakdown ]\nCombos (depending what you get): $4.95-$6.65\nSingle 12' sandwich: $3.00 - $4.95\nThey also sell variates of  spring rolls ( YUM )and have a section for Asian baked goods, smoothies, mocha freezes, and boba drinks!! \n\nMy order:\n- Grilled Beef Sandwich\n- Thai Tea w/ Boba\n- Spring Rolls \n= Deliciousness !!!! \n\n:] Hope you guys enjoy!",

  "text": "This was my second visit here, and it was much worse than the first. This restaurant is extremely small, and if there aren't any seats, you are welcome to stand in the back by the bar without seating, in the way of all the commotion. We stood by the bar for about ten minutes before we were asked if we needed something. We wanted to eat, but not standing up. We saw multiple tables open up, and had to ask if we could sit there, even though we were the only people waiting. We finally sat, and a young,brunette waitress came and took our order. We wanted two orders of the Short Rib fries appetizer, since we would be having it as our dinner opposed to sharing it, and she looked at us like we asked her to bring the whole cow to our table. She asked us if we were sure that we wanted two, and we confirmed that we did. The first order came out in about 5 minutes which was amazing. 10 minutes went by, then 15, and our server didn't even come over to see how our first dish was, just stood in the corner chatting. We got another servers attention after 20 minutes of waiting and let him know we were still waiting on our order. We also advised him that if it wasn't ready, to forget about it and we would share the first one. He came back and told us that it would be out any second. Another ten minutes went by, still no dish, still nothing from our original server. We let the young man know that we were no longer interested in the dish that was 25 minutes late, and then our original server finally decided to come over! Could you believe the first thing she said was \"so im hearing that you never got the second batch of fries?\". As if it was some kind of rumor. Then had the nerve to ask if we still wanted it. She took it off the bill but I was extremely disappointed with the service, and will certainly not return the next time I am in town. Especially since I got sick in the middle of the night from it. Village Whiskey, please train your staff how to serve properly, and give them some lessons on customer service.",

In doing so,  we knew the wait would be long, which it was (an hour and a half), though i hear there's always a wait. \n\nThe place is buzzing with servers and busboys. The tables around the edges of the room are a bit close to one another,  so seating is tight.  The service was though, considering how busy it was.  I ordered the famed cornmeal pancakes with a side of hash browns and a fried egg.  My girlfriend ordered the banana pancakes with a side of bacon.  Everything was amazing.  The pancakes were hearty but fluffy... The side of bacon only comes with three pieces which is disappointing,  but it was cooked to her liking.  The cornmeal pancakes had just the right amount of everything... Bacon,  peppers... Salsa, sour cream,  syrup... Yes,  all of that.  If you're looking for good coffee,  this is not the place, which was surprising. \n\nThe only question is do you go with the homemade syrup or the maple.... Or both",

It's warm, inviting atmosphere is so comfortable you'll want to take a nap in front of the fire after a glass of wine. There's a fireplace in the corner with a cozy set-up, you'll swear you're in a living room of a snug b&b. Also, a bar where you can sit and speak with one of the knowledgable and friendly members of their staff about what kind of wine you'd like to try.\n\nGreat place for a date, girls night or if you want to have a wine tasting experience in a great atmosphere. They offer several different tasting flights of wine (and beer) for a really reasonable price. If you're a regular, look into getting a membership. I spent hours here with a friend sipping wine and relaxing. A must see spot if you like great wine and conversation.\n\nFavorites: \nDiamond Flight\nGold Flight\nThe cozy fireplace :)",

  "text": "We visited the Ihop on Canal Street after a day of traveling and were seated by a friendly waitress. In our group, there were two adults and four children, ages 14, 13, 5 and 3. The waitress brought our drinks and took our order quite efficiently. When the food arrived, one five-stack of buttermilk pancakes were missing. My daughter had to sit and watch everyone eat for some time, while the waitress made promises each trip past our table. Knowing she was starving, I finally gave her one f my three pancakes so she had something in front of her while she waited.\n\nFinally, her order arrived and she began eating. The waitress left my bill on the table - $54. I had ordered the Colorado Omelette which was quite good but when I finished most of it and started on my pancakes, I got a nasty nasty surprise. With the second bite of my pancakes, something felt wrong in my mouth. I reached in and found a hair. I started pulling it out of my mouth and it kept coming and coming, like a fishing line!!! UGH MY GAWD. The thing took both hands and turned out to be a curly reddish hair. It was not mine nor the waitresses as it had obviously been cooked into the pancake. This made me sick to my stomach, of course.\n\nI called the waitress over and showed her. She quickly told me the hair did not match anyone on duty (WHO CARES ABOUT THAT? THE DAMN THING WAS IN MY FOOD!) She asked me if I wanted to speak to the manager and I said no, please just take this food away from the table. She did not ask me if I wanted a replacement (even though I would have said no, it would have been nice if she had offered). She came back to the table a few minutes later and picked up the $54 check, leaving another in its place. I thought maybe she had took my meal off of the bill but NO - now my total was $63.89. Listed as a service charge was $7.73 - she had included her own gratuity after the hair was found. \n\nIHOP used to be my ultimate favorite restaurant but now it just makes my stomach churn and brings back a memory I cannot erase. I will never, ever return to this restaurant and unless something changes in the future, I will never eat at another IHOP err... IHAIR again!!!  \n\nAnd since when did IHOP start adding gratuity into their checks?????????????????",

Decor is simple, white wall with 7 frames of challenge winners and 2 laggy TVs.  The service is fine, not as personal, but nothing really to complain.  The food was the biggest difference between the places.  The pho was plain, no complexity, almost like it came from a dry seasoning pack.  They also recommended the chicken vermicelli as one of their best -- it wasn't.  First off, they call it vermicelli but they used pho noodle instead?  What!!?? It was thick, heavy, and full the stomach quick --- everything a vermicelli not suppose to be.  Anyway, we left unsatisfied.",

  "text": "My husband son and I went in for dinner last Friday night. Upon entering we were greeted by a friendly hostess. As we stood there waiting for her to grab the menus I couldn't help but to notice a strong dirty mop water stench. Thankfully when we left the entry way it didn't carry into the dining room. The remodel is impressive looking. We were sat at a booth. Looking over the menu I was surprised at how limited it was. As long as you make what you offer well no biggie. I ordered the mushroom swiss burger and a beer. My husband ordered the \"knuckle sandwich\", ( tri-tip sandwich served French dip style). My son ordered the chicken strips and we all got French fries as our side. Jesse, our server was nice enough but in the loud dining room you couldn't hear a word he said. I was more annoyed that he didn't take the initiative to speak up than about the noise. The beer came out, although tasty it wasn't cold enough at all. The food came out within a reasonable amount of time. My husband's \"Knuckle Sandwich\" was delicious! That is what the two stars are for. My burger was shockingly small and probably the blandest burger I have ever eaten. My son's chicken strips tasted like they floured them...and that was it... also, no hint of seasoning. The fries are your run of the mill freezer to fryer. I hope they step it up and are successful.",

  "text": "I had a delicious breakfast at Tuttini a few months ago.  I went back for lunch recently and was excited by their sandwich offerings, however, I was not served.  It was 1:45 PM, and their sign states that they serve lunch until 2:30 PM.  I waited in line for 7 or 8 minutes before a woman came out to tell me that the kitchen was closing.  Closing over 30 minutes early!  She said she might be able to make something to go.  So, if you can make something to go, doesn't that mean the kitchen is not yet closed?  Besides, I wanted to have a few minutes to relax in the cozy restaurant and enjoy my sandwich, not gulf it down on the street, so I left.  I got a sandwich at North Star Coffee around the corner and gave them my $10 instead.",

  "text": "When with some local friends for dinner and drinks and it was a cool place, definitely very trendy with the old warehouse feel and wood and industrial vibe. They brew there own beers as the name suggests, I had the copperhead pale ale which was very good. I had the Reuben and it was great, lots of meat piled high, also had the beer battered fried and they were awesome...highly recommend the fries. Others had bacon cheeseburgers and they enjoyed them. Good place to meet friends for food and drinks.",

  "text": "Caveat to this review - this is still their \"soft\" opening.\n\nWe decided at the last minute to walk over for dinner and check out the menu before the crowds start coming in.\n\nThey are off to a good start. We were seated at a high-top by the bar, not my favorite spot, but it will do. The interior has not changed at all so it looks cool and urban and hip and classy-casual as usual. \n\nOur meals were very good and the food was all fresh and hot and very nicely presented. I had the Chicken Picatta and the portion was generous. The sauce was pleasantly lemony with capers all placed over a very nice menage of fresh corn and other veggies. There were mashed potatoes on the side. It was flavorful and nicely cooked. The chicken breast was tender and juicy.\n\nThe service was a bit uneven. We were given menus and he took our drink order after pouring the water. There was a bit of a wait getting our drinks. I am not sure what the hold up was, it was not that busy. We asked to have some time to enjoy our drink and look through the menu. Our waiter returned in due time - about 10 - 15 minutes and we said we were ready to order. My husband ordered another wine - and it never came. So we reorder when he came by to ask if we wanted another drink. I am not sure whether he forgot to put in our drink order, of there was a tie-up at the bar.\n\nWe are looking forward to coming back again and trying some of their other dishes and giving a try to their appetizers.",

  "text": "My first time and the band soul bus was nice. Why they call themselves soul bus I don't have a clue. They weren't playing soul music but they were playing the blues with some jazzy undertones. Nothing worst than a bunch of white boys in jeans that look like they slept in them. It's like an after thought..they just rolled in hit a few licks after laying on the couch all day look.  They knew they had a show! when is dirty looking tees and jeans part of the act? One cat had on a nice shirt  no stage presence at all. \n   I was told is was a classy place..NOT more of a old gentleman's club feel and outdated looking. Had the sushi..gag me. I have had better wont order that again if I return to Daddy Jacks. My guy Aaron at Kroger 79th and fall creek makes it better! it's yummy! He's from Thailand if that helps he is a sushi master.\n  I also tried the buffalo shrimp. Okay I'm thinking these may be what I'm familiar with from my Ann Arbor Michigan experience ..YUCK!  not even close. No batter not even a dusting just 12.50 cent worth of shrimp  thrown in hot sauce. It's beyond laughable..where is the skill in that?  The Corona is always tasty can't mess that up.One thing for certain folks..fool me once that's all you get outta me, I don't fall for it twice when my money is involved.",

  "text": "This Vietnamese restaurant was our last stop before heading home.  We picked up a few sandwiches (banh mi) for $3.50 each.  By the way, it's buy 5 get 1 free.  To our pleasant surprise, this place also serves some popular dishes, such as bun Bo hue (spicy noodle soup), pho, beef stew (bo kho), etc.  We ordered these dishes and they were authentic Vietnamese.   The place was spic and span, including the bathroom.  Since we were there around 11AM and probably were their first customers of the day, we don't know how well the placed is kept clean later during the day.  As for banh mi, we asked for the condiments to kept separate from the sandwiches, as they were not going to be consumed right away.  The folks behind the counter separated each ingredient in its own bag so as to make it easy for us to prepare our sandwiches when we're ready to eat.  Nice touch!!!  The meats for the sandwiches at Seasons Cafe and Bakery were in good quantity, which puts the banh mi shops in Northern VA to shame.  The workers wore gloves when handling foods, and their sanitation practices seem to be better than most typical Vietnamese restaurants we've visited. Wish this restaurant was near us at home in Northern VA.",

But felt remorse for I had just finished coming from the gym but the sesame roll was undeniable. Josiah is awesome and we talked seafood for we were both fanatics and he hooked me up with a fresh complementary piece of fish which I promptly seasoned and baked as soon as I got home!

  "text": "We have been on many cruises on other lines but, we wanted to take our Grandson on a nice trip and figured the Carnival Dream would be a good choice because of the Teen Club they offer. Booking the cruise was fairly easy. The embarkation and disembarkation went fairly well also. The cruise turned out fine for our Grandson but, there were a few things we didn't like. We knew this was going to be a younger crowd and the activities would be geared to that age group but, we were disappointed that there was not a little more available to the older folks as we noticed there were many families traveling with what looked to be older parents and grandparents. The food in the main dining rooms was fine and so was the Lido. The problem in the Lido was that they made you stand in line for everything and the lines were long and slow. The two pools were also very small for that size ship. So small that one could barely find a space to even stand in the water. The stateroom was very nice. It was a good size with a comfortable bed and a step in shower. The three ports were well chosen and there were more than adequate excursions to choose from. Overall, it was what we expected and our Grandson had a very good time which is what really matters.",

  "text": "I've only eaten here twice and my experience has been great overall. The first time I went, they had just opened. There were some kinks but not anything I would complain about. After all, our group had 8 people so it was understandable. Second time was probably a month later and I noticed they figured out some of the kinks. Their servers are nice and I genuinely felt like they wanted to make my experience great. I know this because every time I made a request the waiter would literally run to get it. I've never seen a server so dedicated, kudos! Honestly most of the stars I'm giving them is because of their genuine service. Added bonus, they were playing Star Trek, hunger games, and iron man. Nice movie selections haha.\n\nThe seafood was ok. It's not their fault; it's Tucson so you know you really can't get fresh seafood. That's why I took off a star. They have 1 type of sauce with mild, medium, hot spiciness. It's similar to angry crab's \"trifecta\" or boiling crab's, \"the whole shabang\" but with an Asian twist. It was good in my opinion.\n\nLastly, if anyone has ever gone to angry crab, hot n juicy, boiling crab, should know that the price range is similar. Heck, if anyone has ever bought raw seafood at the store should know that it is on the expensive side. Expensive? Yes. Overpriced? No. I have been to many seafood places similar to this and it's a decent price for what you get. My advice for the Dungeness crab, since it did happen to me at other places and I saw a review on it here, is to share it or get their other selections that they can measure out. The dungeness crab is a full crab so finding a 1 lb dungeness crab is not common. \n\nWould recommend and go again.",
