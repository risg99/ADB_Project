  "text": "I really want to love this place, but they make it so hard. The past three times in a row I've been there, there has been some sort of ridiculous customer service issue that left me and whoever I was with super annoyed.\n\nStarting with the good: the coffee is delicious. The assortment of baked goods is great...quiche is yummy, etc. I've always loved the space...good mixture of comfy couches and real seating where people can sit and work on laptops. Plenty of outdoor seating on nice days.\n\nThe prices are...steep. BUT I always feel good about supporting a local small business, so whatever. My real problem is the 'tude and just general lack of professionalism that I've seen from the baristas. They clearly know their coffee, and that's great, but here are some of the more ridiculous things that have happened to me there in the past month:\n\n--purchased coffee with my mom and went to add our cream and sugar. My mom realized the half and half container was empty and gave the guy behind the counter a head's up. His answer: \"Yeah, we're actually out of half and half.\" Everyone stared blankly at him, including the other people in line. Now mind you, it was before noon, not five minutes before they closed. No apology, no \"I'm so sorry, we sent someone down the street to the 7-11 (literally down the street) to pick some up, they should be back any minute.\" That was it. The guy behind us asked, \"is anyone going to get some more?\" and the kid literally shrugged his shoulders and turned his back to us. Ummmmmm. As my mom said, when you charge people $8 for two coffees (one of which was just a drip coffee), I don't think it's too much to ask that you provide HALF AND HALF AT YOUR COFFEE SHOP. \n\n--another time I was there, a friend asked for her coffee extra hot, and then when it arrived just warm, she asked if they could nuke it in the microwave for a minute. She was very nice about it. The girl behind the counter, on the other hand, felt it necessary to explain in a condescending tone for five minutes that they \"actually can't put the coffee cups in the microwave\" for some reason I now forget, and then reluctantly offered to add some hot water. Uhhhh. Homegirl. Could you maybe just take the coffee and solve the problem? Put it in a to go cup and microwave it? This doesn't seem like THAT hard of a problem to solve, nor can I imagine it's the first time someone has asked for their coffee extra hot. Again, everyone in line sort of looked at each other helplessly as this happened. \n\n--this is a small thing, but they have multiple sizes for every drink on their board, but then half of them apparently only come in one size? I know it's a small issue, but you'd think it would occur to someone to change the menu so they don't have to keep telling people (last time I was there it happened to both me and the woman behind me). \n\nJersey Java owners, please give your baristas some basic lessons in customer service. Again, they know their coffee, and they're generally nice until there's ANY sort of minor hiccup, and then all basic common sense goes right out the window. Your coffee is too expensive for me to have some ordeal every time I go there. Oh, and buy more half and half.",

  "text": "There are restaurants with views and then there are views with restaurants. This belongs to the latter group. Had I known there was a view involved I would not have booked a table as the food is so often an afterthought and overpriced; this was no exception. The cooking was erratic, ranging from superb to amateurish. Fennel appetizer was sensational. Short ribs were dry and stringy and served tepid. The skate was perfect but the fettuccine lackluster. The light over our table was burned out so we ate in partial darkness which only served to highlight the short comings of the dishes. Loved the bread selection at the start and the shortbread cookies and jellies at the end were great! It's a good place for drinks and bar snacks and it feels special. If you care about the food, go elsewhere.",

Our server was friendly and informative with the standard \"it takes 45 mins for a deep dish pizza\" warning. \n\nWe ordered 312s and an order of mozzarella sticks to start. The beer was a little warmer than I like, but the mozzarella sticks were perfection. Crispy and hot with melty, gooey cheese. Yum. \n\nOur pizza was well worth the wait. The deep dish \"Stockyard Patty\" came with a buttery crust, slightly sweet sauce, and a perfect disc of sausage. Our pizza was piping hot and drool-worthy. Definitely reminiscent of Lou Malnati's or Gino's East deep dish pies in Chicago. We will be back for sure!",

  "text": "This place is amazing. Everything is sooo good and I have defiantly been here enough to say I have tried almost everything on the menu. All the workers are friendly and work so hard to keep the line that is usually out the door under control. I have never been in a place that is so busy and still get customers served in a timely fashion. Some of these reviews say this place is in a bad area... Are yall serious? It's right off the interstate and if you go in there over night there is always a police officer.(I think the police officer is there because of the amount of customers in there at one time). Let's just start with the donuts. They r amazing. They have the best donuts around. I love donuts so I have been to just about every donut shop in the Nola area. And these r the best!!!  The donuts are usually hot and they can usually make any special order u want. All U have to do is ask. Whenever I want special orders I call early in the morning and they can usually have it done by noon. The apple fritters here are so good as well!!!  Red velvet cake and Reese peanut butter are my favorites oh wait the Oreo donut is just as good!  Next let's move on to kastleburgers... These kastleburgers are a New Orleans original and no one can top them. These people have to entire process of cooking kastleburgers down to a science. ( or so it appears). I have seen the crystal across the street but any one that is local knows tastee's kastleburgers are so Much better. Does anyone even go to crystal?  Also just like the donuts you can Special order the kastleburgers. They are always made  fresh. The breakfast is so good as well. They use real products. It is defiantly made to order and not typical fast food breakfast. U can order anything u can imagine for breakfast. I have seen people eating hot sausage egg and cheese sandwiches and I have seen all different types of breakfast platters served. They also have a huge selections of po boys and sandwiches that u can order 24/7. Now the hot plates they serve here are so good. They have everything and it's all home cooked u can taste it. It reminds me of when I was little and my grandma fixed me red beans and rice. They also have this pasta defiantly homemade it is so good it has crawfish and shrimp in it.  The gumbo is good as well. All I can say is pass up all other donut shops and come her for the full New Orleans style donut experience. This is an old time genuinely good donut shop the donuts taste the same as they did when I was a child it's so nice to have a restaurant/ donut shop that doesnt take the easy way out cut corners and produce a not so good product. This place is the best donut shop around.",

Let's try closer to 98 degrees. Once you add in all those hyperactive kids with their insanely high metabolisms packed into the small space, the heat problem gets really out of control. They do offer alcohol for the adult crowd, but I don't see how anyone could get through a drink without upchucking.\n\nEven in the winter this place is always crowded. I wouldn't really suggest going in winter, and not just because swimming doesn't sound appealing in the winter. When the outdoor section is closed off, indoors it's slim pickings for attractions. This really is quite a small water park. As far as cleanliness is concerned, it certainly could be worse. However, I feel like the water is always a bit dingy here. You will need a shower ASAP after leaving.\n\nIf you're really hard up for entertainment, then you could always come here with small kids and they'll have a blast. That being said, there's far better water parks out there to choose from.",

Menu here:\n\nhttps://universityclub.iupui.edu/Reservations/Weekly-Menu\n\nExcellent service; my sponsor took me and other staff visiting the school this summer, for a buffet lunch.  The waitstaff were prompt in filling our waters and inquiring about more plates, and also served us whenever we requested (we asked that 2 portions of the red velvet cake be split 3 ways, and the result was prompt and precise, with extra small plates).  She was cheery and interacted with us professionally, even if this wasn't (I don't think) a private sector job driven by Yelp reviews and employee performance surveys.\n\nThe menu itself feels as if it's trying to demonstrate global culinary awareness on a very limited budget.  A couple of salad-y items including cornbread salad, a lively green (spinach) salad, and 2 other choices, plus various dressings that did not come out of a generic commercial bottle.  A couple of starches then proteins including a savory-sweet tofu entry--it was like the spicy peanut butter tofu I make at home, but more breaded and gunky and thus less spicy; a \"kalbi\" meat thing which was sweet and savory, soy sauce style, and kinda clumpy, but tried to hit the Korean flavor profile; and a couple of other animal meat options (uh, fish?).  Some inventiveness for trying to do something for foodies in this very countrified and simultaneously urban environment, I guess.  Culinary diversity efforts are always appreciated, even if the textures were not excellent.\n\nMy guess is they're operating with limited funding and staff, but there's some smart guy or gal doing the menu design, trying to figure how to make this stuff onthe line in a way that doesn't taste mass produced, but that also doesn't violate their financial dictates.  The food was tasty, not old, and satisfying without being too sweet, oily, or salty.\n\nPretty good job, all said.",

There is just enough kick to it without being overpowering. We tried a bit of everything. The poblano grits were a favorite as well as the roffignac cocktail made with sparkling rosé- a perfect blend between the raspberry and lemon. \n\nRandall, our server was super patient. He realized we were there to take our time, and we did not feel rushed. He did his best to answer questions and cater to allergies. Many of the menu items contain shrimp, but they are well aware this is a problem for many people and can make accommodations. \n\nGive them a try for a southern experience close to home!",

There was no price on the chocolate bar or the display, but the total for these two things came out to around $12.  Whatever the breakdown was, at least one of these items was vastly overpriced.  They were good, though, so that earns the place an extra star.  One of the other reviews mentioned that high-schoolers hang out here.  They must have some good part-time jobs.",

A brunch place that I don't need to go into the city for or a global chain restaurant.\n\nI have been here for breakfast & lunch (Marlton & Cherry Hill)  and both times I have been here the food has been spot on!! Everyone at our table enjoyed their food!!  The food is fresh, unique & not greasy like some diner food in the area. I recommend the Marsala Eggs Benedict very good & different and the Benedict sauce was tasty just wish the sauce was a little warmer. I like my poached eggs juicy 1 of the eggs was over cooked for me. I would recommend telling them how you like your eggs cooked. Overall a great place for sunday brunch!! Also don't forget the champange for mamosas!!   \n\nThe wait staff is also great!! Very accommodating without the hidden charges!!  They asked if we would like any of our drinks in a to-go cup.\n\nTurning Point I recommend that you serve the Marsala Benedict in the big spoon serving dish like the others benedict dishes that is a great way of keeping the sauce from the potatoes & everything all on one plate",

I had the Doner Berlin with chicken and added Chickpeas and lettuce to it (along with the cabbage, tomatoes, onions, cilantro, feta & cucumbers that come on the doner already)...IT WAS INCREDIBLE!!! They call this a \"sandwich\" but this is like a gigantic pita only it has a more bread like yet crispy texture. The spicy tzatziki sauce it comes with was so good I had to get more on the side! \n\nI can't wait to come back and try something else!",

  "text": "Vanilla bean lemonade was interesting, but I probably would not do that again. Cheese and cracker plate as an appetizer was very good.   Mac and cheese appetizer had some interesting flavors but seriously needed more moisture.  Lemon artichoke soup was cooked to the point it lost a lot of identity and tasted like a vegetable soup. Those that like a great lemon Greek style soup, this isn't it. Chunky avacado salad was light and excellent. My favorite thing I ate. Crab cake had good lump crab, but a bit too much breading. Chicken salad was good without being remarkable. The live jazz was a nice touch. Overall, pretty good.  Flavors were pretty deep and developed everywhere except in the soup. I'll try something here again.",

I've had the grits, bacon, eggs, biscuits, fruit salad with whipped cream, cornbread........and it is all delicious.  This is one of the best brunch places in the city.\n\nIn addition to great food the service is also very good.  They are attentive without being intrusive.  The only con is that the location is small, which makes for long waits on the weekend for brunch.  Here's a tip - If you arrive after 1:30/2pm on Sunday....you will be seated right away.\n\nEnjoy!",

  "text": "Wow. We came here to end our family vacation, knowing it was going to be pricey. I'd urge everyone to look into the costs up front, so you don't have any surprises on check out. We checked in on a Sunday afternoon, and it was really quick. The rep was knowledgeable and friendly and gave instructions on how to find our room. The room was the cheapest they had, but still really nice, and very clean. We dropped our stuff off and explored. There is so much to see and so much to do. Some of the activies are free, like the fountain show in the evenings, but most aren't, such as the riverboat ride or the spa services. \nDinner our first night was at the Cantina. Prices are decent, and the service was good. Our second night we ate at Piaso (pizza). The pizza was good, for the price. Generous servings for $4. Friendly service and a decent selection of wines. There are at least three coffee houses that I counted, and all serve Starbucks coffee. \nThere are three pools - one indoor and two outdoor. The Cascades Outdoor Pool has already 1.5' small pool that was perfect for our three year old, and the larger pool went up to 4'6\" which was great for our 8 year old. There is a great locker room by the Cascades Indoor Pool that has showers, a hair dryer, and restrooms. \nOverall my family and I had a great time, and I don't regret the money we spent for the two nights we were here (which was a lot). Just do your research, and take the time to see the scenery. It is breathtaking!",

I've been here a few times with them and have never been impressed, but after today felt the need to write about it.\n\nUsually when I order a 7-9 dollar cheesesteak I save half for another time so I don't feel like I'm over-eating. When my chicken cheesesteak was put in front of me today I had to ask the waiter if the cook accidentally used only half the normal portion of meat. I've never seen such an empty steak sandwich in my life and easily housed the whole thing, plus the measly pickle spear and miniature bag of chips. \n\nAfter confronting the waiter he asked me if I wanted another and I told him \"no, not if this is the normal portion size. Do they always look so empty?\" I won't quote the waiter exactly but his reply was along the lines of that's the normal portion size but the chef doesn't know what he's doing and that's why it looks small. \n\nThis was a disgrace of a cheesesteak, and thus worthy of a 2 star review considering all the times I've eaten here in the past have been a solid \"Meh\".",

I thought the buffet had good choices (although I didn't try everything and I realize that everyone's favorites might not be there).  I just had bacon, scrambled eggs, hash browns and a cinnamon roll.  Everything was at least satisfactory except the cinnamon roll, which was excellent.  It was the only roll I've found that is comparable to Cinnabon's.  Maybe the roll was a little soft, but that was more than made up for by the flavor.  I knew it would be bad, but I had to go back for seconds.  It took a lot of willpower not to just stay and eat roll after roll, especially since by that point they were effectively free.  I don't know how lunch and supper buffets are, which is why this os only four stars, but the cinnamon rolls are five stars in my book.  And the service was also very good.",

The owners greet the customers and it is a quick grab and go. Today we tried the cookies, They had four different kinds in the case, and after I got my order and man walked in and asked for the cookies that they were famous for, just my luck they were coming out of the oven. They are a triple(yes triple) chocolate cookie. I selected the Blueberry Almond cookie, it was chocked full of blueberries, I almost did not feel guilty eating it because it had two super foods (blueberry and almonds). We also got the chocolate chip, this was a little crusty, I am sure it would be a good dunking cookie, but I only dunk basketballs not cookies. Finally we got the oatmeal raisin. It was a nice cookie, but I think my recipe is better. The place lives up to its name... Bonus, they do sell coffee to go...No almond milk though.",

We did our research, discussed various concepts and then worked with Doug Auer and Michael Moran for the implementation.

It was busy during the lunch hour but wait times were minimal. We asked to sit outside but the bugs were so bad we decided to move to the inside seating. The staff was accommodating and very helpful. The food was delicious and we got a lot for a good price. We loved it so much we went back a second night! Will recommend this place and if in the area again will go back.",

I stopped by early one evening had a sesame ball, which was filled with bean paste. The glutinous rice of the ball was nicely flavored, similar to Bai Tang Gao. Definitely as place worth stopping at if you are in the area.",

I wanted to get acrylics and since they did plain ole acrylics (unlike the 2 other salons I previously went to), I sat down and let the lady go to work. Halfway through she informed me that they would be $60 plus $5 for a french tip, so I might as well just get the gel for $70. For $70, these acrylic nails should be able to give me magical powers. Instead, they are uneven, transparent enough that my nail bed shines through, and cracking 2 days later. It took an hour and a half, they switched girls in the middle of the process and the quality is appalling. I highly suggest going to another nail salon in the area.",

Something didn't taste right with that (it's curry).\nPad Thai was soggy and didn't taste like regular Pad Thai.\nLastly the mango with black sticky rice. Sticky rice was too sweet - they had incorporated the condensed milk into it so there's no way to adjust the sweetness. Then the mango itself was sour - not ripe enough.",

I had the eggs benedict, which is really not a 'go to' for me, but I was feeling adventurous. The eggs benedict was good as was the 4th St. Corn. The service was good.

You will also see 5 + huge flat screens on the wall, along with vending machines filled with laundry necessities and snacks/drinks.  The machines: various sizes of commercial grade washers & dryers.  Washers range from $3-$6.50 and dryers are $.25 or $.50 for 7-8 minutes (depends on size).  \nThere are always staff around and they're nice and helpful.  I think they also offer washing/folding services - ask the front desk.  \nParking is not usually an issue unless it's peak after work hours.  Walk to Starbucks while you wait - or sit at one of their tables or chairs and enjoy their free wifi.  Forget the quarters- this place uses laundry cards you can refill on your Visa/MasterCard.\nThis place puts my old laundromat to shame, and it's closer to home, cleaner, nicer and all around better (no more quarters!!!!!!)\nLast wash at 9:30pm.",

We made it work but my back really would've been better off on an actual bed versus a springy outdated couch. Besides the sleeping situation we really enjoyed our stay. The Mall is right next door so we took advantage of the beautiful weather and walked over. There are a ton of great restaurants right near the hotel as well as the IMAX movie theater.

The man did the nails (which were fine/good except for some acrylic on the sides which he fixed later) and then she painted them. The polish job was sloppy. I had bare spots on the edges, lumps (old polish?) and overspill onto the sides and cuticles. She did not follow up with polish remover to clean them up - instead, as she painted, she ran her nail along the edges to remove it. Not quality. \n\nI happen to like nail art once in a while - not every time - but sometimes I splurge. There does not seem to be anyone who does nail art well. There are many designs you can choose from on the hand models/boards but they are not recreated well. I chose one design for my big toes and it looked nothing like what I picked out. On an earlier visit, I had a picture of a design on my phone and was told point blank they couldn't do it - it was not complicated or too fancy. ??? I have witnessed other customers being disappointed in the nail art feature as well. \n\nOverall, I think this place may be understaffed to meet demand and is struggling with consistent quality. They need another person who can do nails really well like the man does and they need to take their time/provide thorough service.",

Came and refilled out chips once, cleared plates in good time as we were done, and just overall really nice. Again, didn't feel rushed at all which was prefect because we were watching the phillies game so stayed awhile after our meal. One dissapointing part though.. the smore bread pudding i was so excited for, completely not what i was expecting. It was basically two less dense chocolate brownies with a graham cracker sitting on top and marshmallow ice cream. Of course it tasted good but I wouldn've thought it would be a bread pudding with a graham cracker crust or something, not just a graham cracker thrown on top. So that's my only negative part about this place. \n\nFried pickle chips, delicious! Make sure you let them cool, they taste so much better when they're not burning hot.",

  "text": "I have been to this location twice and the first time it was much better than last night. Simply, the beer is just ok. I love good beer but I will drink it whether I think it is amazing or awful. I got 4 of their current seasonal beers in a sampler (batch 100, winter warmer, undead black IPA and paramount). They were decent, nothing to write home about or come back the next day for. The reason they lose points from last night was because of the food, not the beer.  Got a black and blue burger. It had just too much blue cheese on the burger and the meat was just alright and they also skimped on the fries. The price is steep for their higher end food but I think their entrees are very good and will stick with those for next time.\n\nP.S. For anyone looking to avoid big parties, babies and young kids (1-12 years old) I have always seen a big group of people who decide to bring their children with them. Kids never bother me but they are kids so they make noise and run around the restaurant. Not much you can do about it besides sitting at the bar.",

Stopped by after working up an appetite running errands in town and we happened to show up during happy hour - two for one drinks (possibly also applies to alcoholic drinks, but we both got boba teas instead)\n\nThe scallion pancakes were a perfect appetizer. They came out hot, crispy, and a little oily, delicious.\n\nThe tonkatsu chicken and fried tofu bao were both delicious. All the condiments on their bao make for a sort of savory, sort of sweet flavor combo (cilantro, sweet sauce, and a few other things I don't remember off the top of my head)\n\nThe popcorn chicken was also excellent. Tiny, very crispy bits of chicken served with rice and a potato salad. I didn't try the potato salad, but heard it was more of a macaroni salad. \n\nI highly recommend Taiwan 101.

The menu was confusing as they have fresh fish on the menu but if it does not have a checkmark beside it they do not currently have it. I wanted halibut but there was no checkmark. So I asked the waitress for a recommendation. She recommended the snapper dish. So I ordered that. Then the server came back to tell me the snapper was still frozen solid. The chef recommended I get the red fish but I did not want that. So I got the swordfish.  It was good but I was disappointed.  The waitress was friendly and took good care of us. I said well get me a discount since you didn't have what I wanted. No discount and no manager came out to apologize for not having dishes ready to go for a Friday lunch. We will probably come back but are disappointed in this trip to one of our favorite restaurants. You would think they would have better customer service and have all menu items prepped for the weekend!",

So much potential but really fell short...here is The Good The Bad and The Ugly.\n\nThe Good- as mention the interior is amazing, makes you want to back and relax all night long. Fish and chips was solid.\n\nThe Bad- Soooo... I have never had to eat a burger with a knife and fork... why did I have to do that you may ask? (See pic) the bun was so dry it crumbled into dust as I held it and took a bite. It was brioche bun that was way dry and appeared to have an egg wash on it which just made matters worse. I will say the burger meat, with bacon and English cheddar if eaten all at the same time was great, though burger meat by itself needed season.  \n\nThe Ugly- the coleslaw straight up had turned, it smelled like rotting vegetables in fishy water and tasted the same. I literally spit it out it was that bad.\n\nI am sadly seeing a food quality issue here, borderline need health inspectors to visit on that coleslaw.\n\nAlso side note if they had more local craft beers other then 2-3 on draft, an extensive bourbon list this would make a killer spot for drinks and drinks only until food quality is resolved. Wishful thinking as well but would be great if this was a cigar bar as the atmosphere is prime for that.\n\nPS- other people bitched about pricing but we felt it was very inexpensive. $51 for 2 meals, 3 drinks.\n\nI really hope they make some of these suggested changes sooo much potential for go to spot.",

The atmosphere is great, service is great, and the food is amazing. Not only are their donuts tasty as heck, but their sliders are to die for as well. If you are a donut fan or just a sweet-tooth, you got to try this place. NOTE: The food truck that you might see around town, IMO, does not have the same quality. Go to the location on Magazine St.",

Food was ordered for a couple of girls in our office and when dealing with Ashley the young lady from our office got into a long drawn out convo with her and they had words. \nI was not the one on the phone call, so I did not think I was going to be treated poorly, but I was.  I don\\'t understand why Ashley would not give us her first name unless she was concerned about something. By her doing so, it made myself and a co worker that came in with me feel as if something was probably done to our food. The guys in the kitchen were watching us curiously, trying to hold back from laughing as if maybe they spit in the food. \nI called the owner David to discuss all of this and he did not take the call or call me back",

The bread for the sub is made onsite, high quality meats, veggies, and their own yummy coleslaw red pepper condiment.  The subs are only $5.00  Eating a sub without Mayo or mustard is really refreshing.  Eat one here (BTW, I really doubt you will be able to eat the whole thing in one sitting), and you will never go to Subway again unless someone else pays.  You will be surprised about the weight of the sub that is packed with yummy things.\n\nIf not having lunch, there is a bakery with all of the goodies, inexpensive coffee bar, cheese and wine room, fresh pasta, deli, olives, etc.  It's a St Pete landmark for a reason.   \n\nVisit on a non-Saturday, if you like elbow room.",

There is beer and wine.  I usually come here for a big bowl of pazole for breakfast, but before I do that you must order some tomales.  Get here early for the tamales because the line gets long.

Our chef, Tanaka, was great...and the tofu was AMAZING. We also had miso soup, noodles, vegetables, and fried rice. Everything was great except the vegetables, which were pretty bland. We also got a side of mushrooms, which was a waste...not flavorful at all. Portions were big. Service was great!",

I went in for lunch earlier this week to try out the vegetarian hoagie... i had the veg special. It was delicious. The roll very crispy and fresh, the flavors very strong- jalepeno, cilantro, sauteed veggies, tofu, and some sort of yellow mayo that I always think is a dessert (mango pudding?) when I see it in the case.  Anyway the sandwich is delicious, and although prices are now $4 for a sandwich (up from $1.50) its still a steal for a quick lunch.  I also tried the rice and mung beans with coconut milk for dessert- delicious, an excellent way to add a little protein to a yummy dessert. Next time you're in the neighborhood I'd recommend stopping in to support this local business.",

Our guide was very good and threw in some jokes from time to time which mainly was focused on the Chicago Cubs.  \n\nAs for the reviewer mentioning about not bring babies or toddlers, my 3 year old daughter loved the tour, so much was going on around her that she was distracted.

Located in the heart of South City on Morganford, The Haven is all you can imagine in your quintessential neighborhood bar.  The inside is like a shrine to St Louis traditions. Walls glittered with plaques of the arch and Cardinals greats. Neon beer signs illuminate the hard wood walls; and make you feel like you're at your uncle's basement all over again. Here is a place to get to know the real locals, the real St Louisians who have lived here their whole lives. As I sat here, I observed how everyone knew each other, chiming in here and there about how so and so's daughter is doing, and etc, etc. The wait staff was warm and welcoming, and the bar is a place where you can sit back and be yourself.  I'm happy I discovered this gem, and the visit still sticks with me, because of how it brought me closer to know the city better.  I highly recommend anyone not from here to check this place out.",

Indian food is delicious but I am horrible at remembering what I ordered before. Unfortunately this review is another victim of my not being able to remember the names of what we ordered. One dish was mostly spinach (a total hit), another was some red chicken dish (perfectly cooked but looked like it was dyed red), and naan which is everyone's favorite. If you know your Indian dishes you won't be disappointed. Kids are always welcome there. Be sure to enjoy downtown while you're there.",

Ghini's is a popular place with a solid reputation---and the bakery next door is a favorite too. I'm awarding the cafe four stars instead of five because the place does get a little chaotic during the peak times (again, just like the Cup) and I can see how a first-time visitor might find that off-putting.

  "text": "Meh. The promise of a well-made cocktail somehow was not fulfilled on a busy Saturday night. Pity, because we were so looking forward to this place. Made me feel so much better about our cocktail bar back home, which has a consistency that Loa seemed to be lacking. Though I had to practically beg for a cocktail menu, at least the bartenders were nice and willing to accommodate after all.\n\nNeither of our cocktails were balanced - mine, too sweet; my companion's, too sour. The strong piped-in artificial floral... citrus... whatever aroma in the hotel lobby, where we were forced to sit due to the large and noisy crowd in the tiny bar, also did not help me enjoy my cocktail one bit. My companion was more of a fan of the minimalist atmosphere, but I'll take comfort over style any day.",

I had veggie enchiladas w green sauce and it was flavorful and complex and not watery like most other Mexican veggie  dishes around town.   Im so impressed and happy to find this gem. My partner had  chicken enchiladas with red sauce and refried beans.  The red sauce reminded me of the sauce an immigrant woman I worked with used to make for potlucks.  I know I am shamelessly gushing but if you read my other reviews then you will know that it's not typical. The bartender Iris is very helpful and was a great server. Also one more thing, I want to mention the spicy margarita. It is now my new favorite drink in town. It has cilantro jalapeño and (I believe) cucumber and it is amazing.",

I popped in shortly before the place was going to close for the day, but that didn't matter - the employees were beyond friendly and helpful.  After some discussion, I decided to go with some pork chops, which had to be cut.  No problem, the staff was willing to cut the chops to the thickness of my liking.  And man, were they some of the best pork chops we've ever had.\n\nI had such a great experience that I went back 2 days later, this time with my husband, a lover of all things meaty.  We were again greeted and helped by the exceptional staff.  The experience you will have at Cappuccio's is worth the trip alone, but their meats are also exceptional.  I think we've found our local butcher shop.",

I've been twice and there was so much grit  and unevenness on the floor from cracks that I was afraid of rolling my ankle and doing serious damage to myself. In a sport like racquetball you really need at least a level court that you won't slip and slide on. I also noticed a lot of trash in them too, like a pregnancy test. For such a nice park as Francis is, I expected better.\n\nIf you live on the Hill or South Hampton area, go to Tilles Park first for Racquetball, that's my number two spot for RB behind Forest Park.",

The salon was beautiful and well kept, and the owner or manager desk person was a total delight and I would go back for lashes or just a pedi bc the pedi there was honestly incredible the tech had me in heaven. Also the prices were reasonable.\n\nBut the mani is just meh. I didn't really inspect my nails when I left bc I was in a hurry. It's just frustrating I can do my own nails better and paint all the way to the sides without leaving a gap. But toying with an at-home LED lamp is a pain.\n\nSo the nitty gritty: There are little bumps and bubbles. I had to pick clear and colored gel off my skin later and trim where it had pooled in cuticles with nail scissors. Several nails were filed slightly assymetrically. Also they do something called wrapping their tips with a extra layer so it's sealed under and looks kind bulbous on the nail, like thicker visibly and to the touch at the tips. \n\nThat being said the tech was super sweet and genuinely nice. But if I went again I would just stick to a pedi or request someone else for a mani.",

My food was bland, the spring rolls were fishy, the soda chanh was intensely sugared and I left feeling, \"eh.\" We went last Friday and I ate pesce while there. I went with the tofu lemongrass and I seriously wish there was more sauce. It barely covered my tofu which left me eating unsauced noodles. I tried adding a ton of add-ons to try and get some flavor out of the sauce but no dice. The peanut sauce for the shrimp rolls was super watery and again the shrimp tasted old. The soda chanh was crazy sweet. I still enjoyed it but between that and the food I wavered between over-sugared and over-salted. My manpanion had the pho and he gave it an \"eh\" as well. I will say the prices were pretty awesome but I'm not sure we'll be back. There are other Vietnamese restaurants that I would rather frequent, e.g. Far East. FYI - they are now run by the owners of Miss Saigon and I had that very same dish there. It was sauced well and had much more flavor.",

Both places are quite similar, but FC had an air of pretentiousness that Boilermaker didn't.  FC was also considerably more expensive for smaller portions whereas Boilermaker's beers and food were reasonably-priced.\n\nTheir beer week offerings featured over a dozen from their brewery, Cabinet Artisinal Brewhouse which are mainly sour and/or really interesting beers.  I absolutely loved everything I tried.  One of the two bartenders was very knowledgeable and all were helpful.  We ordered their hot dog plate which was 2 bacon-wrapped hot dogs with a mountain of fries for $9 which is a pretty good deal IMO.\n\nUnfortunately, I just read that the headbrewer is leaving Cabinet Artisinal Brewhouse.  Hopefully they can get another highly skilled brewer to continue pumping out unique brews (especially my beloved sours) as their beers were a big reason I'd go back to this place.",

  "text": "I hesitated to give 5 stars only because it is more of a take out place for me, but for what it is it deserves 5 stars.  This is not the sit down with a date kind of place (although their dining area is clean and well kept).  I think it is 5 star worthy for the quality of food you get for the price.\nI make crab rangoon and because of that I usually don't like restaurant's crab rangoon, but theirs is excellent.  Their dishes are also very fresh and flavorful.  My favorite is the Roast Pork in Garlic sauce which they modify for me to not be hot.\nI've never had a problem with the service, they are always very friendly and fast.\nHighly recommend!!",

Match this with a cafe from Old City coffee and you are in for a treat these two left me full and ready for the day. Thankfully it's was a very active day and it helped me avoid the sugar crash. This was also because these items were not over sweet and rich in flavour. I can not enjoy something that is too sweet and lacking in flavour. I will return to try the lemonciello pecan diamonds and pasticcios. \nCheck this place out in the Reading market you'll like it.",

There were only 3 other tables there when we came in but it filled up throughout the hour & a half we were there. I would suggest making a reservation as there are only about 12 tables total - & it's BYO so bring your own wine. \n\nI forget the actual name of the appetizer we got but it was basically fried risotto with mozzarella & marinara. It came out as 3 decent sized fried balls. They were delicious. I got the filet - which I asked to be cooked medium... it came out more on the medium-well side but it was fine. It's an Italian place... I should have known better :) BUT, the sauce & jumbo lump crab meat & mushrooms on top of the filet was amazing. It was served with sliced potatoes & green beans. My bf got the gnocchi & it was served in a butternut squash sauce... so good. I almost wish I would have gotten the gnocchi because they were pillowy & delicious. I'd definitely come back for those alone. We also got a side of homemade pasta with marinara sauce. It was good but I've had better homemade pasta at some other places. \n\nI have to admit, I expected to be there awhile since all the food is made to order but we were in and out within an hour & a half. We'll definitely be back.",

Not only were we an apparent nuisance to the baristas reviewing Halloween costumes with their (boy)friends, but also were treated with, as one other customer said, much shade.\n\nI brought my own cup in which to have my coffee. However, when I asked if she could put the drink in my cup, I received elevator eyes, a smirk, and a clear, \"No\". Ok, I thought, sometimes sizes are difficult to estimate in a different cup.\n\nThen, as we were sitting down enjoying our coffees, I turned around to look at the counter for WiFi info. I received a stern look from the barista, who then exclaimed \"Can I hep you with something?\", to which I responded, \"oh, I was just looking if you had WiFi.\" The barista responded, \"We have a sign, for you,\" again with a plethora of shade.\n\nWill never return, thanks for trying.",

When we first got there I was so tired and hungry and put out by the lack of parking but by the time we left I had completely forgotten! \n   The waitstaff is top notch! We decided to try and have a seat at the bar area while we waited for a table to open up. While we were standing there, a man (who I believe is the owner) offered to let us sit there! We received excellent service (and conversation!) from there on out.\n     My boyfriend and I started out with mimosas and Bloody Mary to start out with. Their Bloody Mary is made to your liking with sake instead of vodka, which gives it a wonderful flavor! The spice level was perfect. I later tried a pineapple mimosa and ordered an apple cider mimosa. Both were delicious. I ordered the meat lover's omelet, and it was great, but my boyfriend ordered the steak and eggs. The steak was one of the best steaks I've ever eaten!!!! The sauce that came with it was out of this world. I also had the bananas foster pancakes, which tasted just like they came from one of my favorite New Orleans brunch spots. \n    On a personal note, I work a lot. I'm away from home a lot too so the time I get to spend with my loved ones is sacred. I will always remember this brunch because everything about it was percent- our table, the waiters, the owner's attention to us-it all came together to create a lovely experience.

  "text": "HUGE disappointment!  I am from Seattle and came down to Santa Barbara for New Year's Eve.  My girlfriends and I wanted to have a nice meal to bring in 2010. I thought I did my research--read reviews, got a recommendation from a local, and thought the online menu looked good.\n\nWhen I called to make a reservation I had a lovely conversation with the owner--another confirmation that I had made the right choice.  Well, I couldn't have been more wrong.\n\nMy girlfriends and I got dressed up, made our way to the restaurant, and the second we walked in, I knew it was a mistake.  It was too cold to sit outside (which was beautiful), and so we went into the brightly lit indoor part of the restaurant, surveyed the scene and realized that we were the youngest people there by at least 40 years (and we are in our 30s).  The \"Latin jazz\" band was little more than forgettable background music, which did absolutely nothing to help the vibe.  There was no vibe.  The restaurant lacked energy, the wait staff were professional, but not personable, and the food was incredibly disappointing.\n\nWe knew we would be paying a lot (total 100.00 each) for a price fixe New Year's Eve dinner--and I have no problem spending that if the food is amazing, and the experience is unforgettable. As soon as we sat down we started to be served, the wait staff, highly attentive, perhaps because all of the food was already prepared in the back, not many people were there, and they wished they didn't have to work on New Year's Eve.  It was too much.  We got our drinks (mediocre mojitos) and immediately were served our appetizers, which made it hard to enjoy our drinks.  We could not languish over any of our dishes, but perhaps this was better, because the food was absolutely terrible.\n\nI can only speak to what I ordered--it was the New Year's Eve price fixe, and apparently there was a guest chef that night, but I couldn't eat the majority of it.  The empanadas were OK; the soup was fine; I had a salad that had some kind of tangy dressing that I couldn't bear to put in my mouth.  The main dish I ordered was fish and it was served in tin foil.  I understand if it was cooked this way, but to serve it on a plate, with sides on the outside of the tin foil, made no sense to me.  In the end, it didn't even matter because the fish had absolutely no taste.\n\nWe ended up leaving before the clock struck 12:00--none on us wanted to start 2010 in a place that was bland, vibe-less, and forgettable.  I understand that this night may have been different from other nights, but it literally left a bad taste in my mouth and I will not return there nor recommend it to others.",

  "text": "Although I lack the gene that allows a person to get excited about sports, I still love seeing games at this stadium. It is so well designed, there is hardly a bad seat in the house. Even the ones in the pavilion take my breath away. And I love, love, love how the city is framed in the outfield. \n\nThe stadium is located in South Philly, wayyyy down there, away from downtown. It is nice because people can tailgate, which is like a great anthropological discovery for someone from a city whose stadium is right downtown. You can come early? And cook burgers? And drink beer? And you don't have do it at a bar? Fascinating! \n\nI was pleasantly surprised to discover the games feel shorter when you watch them at the stadium. I think this has a lot to do with the fact that the fans are kept entertained, even in the lull between innings. Plus the Phanatic has an effing hot dog bazooka! Come the hell on! But seriously, even if you don't know a thing about baseball, you will not be bored.\n\nThe tickets are relatively cheap for a professional sporting event, although they have become more difficult to obtain since the Phillies won the world series. Prior to this season, I used to be able to get decent seats the same week of the game without using a reseller. This is just what happens when your team kicks some serious ass, I suppose.\n\nThank god they have decent beer here. Seriously. Brewerytown carries Victory on tap and Dogfish Head in bottles. Since Prima Pils is my favorite pilsner, that makes me first a happy lady... then a drunk lady, despite the $7 price tag.\n\nIn addition to real beer, there is real food! There are even vegetarian options other than fries and pretzels. At my last game, I tried a cheesesteak from Tony Luke's. It was bready, but certainly nowhere near the worst I've ever had. Someone caught a ball about 10 seats down from me and THANK GOD the camera did not pull out enough to catch me scarfing that thing down. My dignity is still intact for the moment. \n\nFinally, I have read a few reviews that say Phillies fans are violent assholes, but I have to disagree. Passionate? Definitely. Are there a few bad seeds? Of course, there always are. Believe me, I come from drunken, violent, asshole fan MECCA. If there is anything I am an expert in, it is perhaps this topic. If you have an issue, there are ushers all over the place and it is made clear that they take complaints seriously.",

I don't really enjoy hookah so it's not there for me and prices and happy hour don't draw me in! As far as I'm concerned I only follow friends in, not go by myself! Not to mention o.o it's proximity to other clubs puts it in the \"eh\" category! I don't want to totally trash the place so I do want to praise the couches and staff! The employees I've had the pleasure of meeting are spectacular and for that I give them the 3 stars!

The host was not friendly and gave the feeling of us being a burden to them. Once pointed to self seating and having a seat, the waitress brought waters but we were left without menus.  I went to the front to inquire about menus but the waitress has jumped in front of me after over hearing my wife ask me about the menus.  I apologized and told her we didn't know if we were suppose to get our own menus or if they would be brought to us.  She just stared not indicating anything.  I just walked back to our seats with her where she handed us the manus and then walked away again not saying anything.  After sitting for a few minutes my wife and I didn't know if we were suppose to order at the bar or with the waitress and at this point I was annoyed with the service and decided we should just leave.  I will never go here again!",

  "text": "Spot has been on my burger list to try for sometime. Spot burger consistently shows up on numerous best of Philly burger lists. When they opened up shop in Brewery town, I quickly bookmarked Spot and waited for a burger craving to hit me to give it a try.\n\nSpot is on West Girard Ave and I was able to find parking easily and close by on a Sunday night. The space is clean and bright with tables in the front, and back. There is also counter seating. There was some nice use of wood on the walls which gave Spot a cool urban vibe design.\n\nThe people that work at Spot were very friendly and helpful. They explained the specials and helped us with suggestions. I was surprised that Spot has other items such as Fish & Chips and Muscles in addition to burgers, sloppy Joe's, pulled pork and cheese steaks. Mental notes for my next visit.\n\nI went with the Spot burger; which had hickory smoked bacon, cheddar, pickles, coleslaw and Spot sauce. This was a great burger. The bun was excellent, fresh and toasted just right.  The burger was moist and juicy. The bacon was great and the slaw and sauce really made this one darn tasty burger. My daughter had the Santa Fe with Avocado, pepper jack cheese, jalapeño, red onion, sun dried tomatoes and a slightly spicy sauce. This was also a really good tasting burger! Spot really shines with their use unique toppings and sauces. \n\nWe ordered the plain fries too and these were crispy and not greasy. They were very good fries but Sketch still has my favorite fries. We had a couple of Fanta sodas too, which was pretty cool. All of our food came out surprisingly fast.\n\nSpot is very high up on my burger list and very close to Sketch. Spot lived up to the hype and is really cool little place in an up and coming section of the city. I will be back and probably soon. 4 plus Yelps.",

  "text": "First - Dear YELP admins, how could the word \"hoagie\" fail your spell checker? C'Mon already!\n\nEveryone has a favorite steak shop or two and they can be as different as night and day. White House, Tony Luke's, Geno's, Pudge's - like comparing apples and pigs, or Wilt to Magic, or Kung Fu to Karate, you just can't compare iconic examples different styles.\n\nLarry's is like that. I've been coming for 30 years. Once or twice, I even stepped up to the Houseway Belly Filler. I think this was the first place I ever had a meat topping on a steak sandwich (pepperoni), but it wasn't the last. \n\nWhat makes Larry's Larry's? First, the guy is cooking in the window. Next, the steaks are chopped. Not shredded, fluffed, laid out or shingled. Even the toppings on our chicken cheese steak hoagie were chopped - a devout nod to every-bite-the-same sandwich science. A lot of work goes into every steak. Finally, the fresh Amoroso-style roll is just a little toasted, not enough to be a grinder, but certainly not steamed on the grill like an AC sub. \n\nWhen on Hawk Hill and hungry go to Larry's. Is it the best steak ever? Nah, but it is an institution and true to itself. As you take your first bite, envision yourself bustin curfew on the way home from seeing Neil Young at the Spectrum, or watching the Sixers take the NBA crown, or sweating whether Y2k will crash your Palm II. If you twist my arm, Larry's doesn't crack my top 5, but tradition is tradition, and Larry's has stood the test of time for good reason.",

  "text": "You get what you see--chicken fingers. They also serve wings and other overpriced items like mac and cheese (mediocre) and pastries (meh). \n\nThe sauces are unique and probably the best part about this place as you won't be able to find sauces like this elsewhere. Be watchful of how full the sauce is because some of the containers are not completely full and you get jipped. Sadly you can't sample the sauces without having to buy them. My favorite is bar b q sauce. It has a slight acidic vinegar kick, but isn't bittersweet. Maybe they cut back on the sugar? The chipotle lime mayo is great. It isn't too creamy and oily. The chipotle is subtle, almost dull and a little bit more would make it better and bold. I found myself having to double dunk the chicken in this sauce to really taste it. You always finish it wishing you had a little more. I've tried almost all of them and none of them are too memorable that I can recall anything great or bad about the rest of the sauces.\n\nThe breading is thin and crisp, which I appreciate. With one bite you taste the breading and chicken, and not just breading on heavily breaded chicken that other places might serve. The breading can be over salty and seasoned too much. Don't mistake this for rich and intense. It is salty. I end up drinking a lot of water with this meal partially due to this. What makes the breading suck is that it is not always fresh. Who knows how long the chicken has been sitting out.\n\nThe meat can be hit or miss; the chicken can be a little parched. This is disappointing when you have a whole pound of chicken to consume that will leave your mouth dry and leave you bloated after you drink a lot to quench your thirst and high sodium intake. More often then not, I always get the dried, salty chicken instead of the juicy, tender chicken that I once got at my very first visit. Perhaps I am unlucky and get the left over stale pieces that have been sitting out long. I can only recall once when my chicken was tender and juicy when they first opened.I try to avoid wasting money here because I have not had the same type of meal since my first. However, out of desperation to try something different than the usual univ city food, I have eaten here a few times to make this review justified.\n\nWhat my friends and I would like to do is split up and someone get french fries from Greek Lady and the others get chicken from Wishbone. We would satisfy our elementary palates by eating chicken fingers and french fries. If you are willing to walk a few more blocks, Allegros has really good curly fries but portions are a lot bigger when you eat at the place.\n\nI would have given this place 1.5 stars for the food, but they once cancelled a chicken wing eating contest on my friends and me just hours prior to the event with poor explanation so I knock it down to 0.5 stars, but yelp doesn't have 0.5 increments.",

Or can it?????\n\nI called and made an appointment and was told my first visit would be 2 hours long. Upon arrival, I filled out various forms and answered lots of health questions before meeting my student acupuncturist. Soon Steve and Lori (Lori was very new and observing) took me to a separate room across the courtyard where the room was divided in two by Japanese type screens. I sat down with Steve as he went over my health profile and he asked very, very in-depth questions. After  spending considerable time doing this, I was asked to get up on the table. Steve felt pulses in various spots on my body and had Lori do the same. It's very interesting...they also look at your tongue several times! \n\nFinally, they decided on a treatment plan and left me to relax while they went to speak to the supervisor (I assume a licensed acupuncturist) to review the suggested treatment. Ten minutes later they came back and explained everything they'd do doing. Steve was very gentle and managed to hit all the right spots. Once all the needles were inserted, I was left to relax and listen to soothing sounds for about 15 minutes. They came back and took everything out and spent a few more minutes talking.\n\nI've since gone back a few more times and on my last visit, Steve added acupressure seeds to my ear. He asked one of the students studying Oriental Medicine to do a consultation and a particular Chinese herb was suggested.\n\nSo going back to my opening, let me tell you this - it doesn't hurt! Acupuncture can be very beneficial for so many things - not just pain. Give it a try!",

  "text": "My hubby and I ate here (on our second visit) last Friday night before checking out Anthony Bourdain at the Fox.  We both ordered salads which arrived quickly, were nicely proportioned, and were pretty darn tasty.  We split a funghi pizza which was decent - a nice change of pace from the deep dish at Pi and the crappy delivered stuff - but I wouldn't call it great.  The service was good, but again not great, as it was on our first visit.  \n\nFor me, the draw of this place is the laid-back atmosphere.  We sat outside, had a couple of brewskis, and enjoyed a nice meal at a reasonable price.  I wouldn't choose this place to impress guests from out of town, but I will certainly return for a fun and low-key start to an evening out.",

The first time it came within the stated time frame and was ok, so we continued to order.  The last three times I've ordered Reginelli's they always say that delivery will be about 45 minutes (thats ok) but when the hour mark occurs I usually give them a call to ask as to the status of my order.  They always say, \"We're sorry, we suddenly got really busy, its on its way.\"  (This wasn't on a weekend, holiday or Mardi Gras, so go figure about the sudden rush)\n\n...\n\nMy pizza finally arrived somewhere around the 2 hr mark and was stone cold (all three times).  The first time I called them back to complain and the lady on the phone basically said, \"We're sorry, we'll replace it but it will be at least hour and a half before we get it to you.\"   The last two times, I didn't even bother to call.  \n\nIf a pizza delivery comes late once, thats understandable, it does happen, but when it happens three times with the same company then its time to call someone else.",

We showed up as recommended 45min before they opened the doors and were about 10th in line, sat in the first row of benches and proceeded to have the best time over the next three sets.  Having read that they don't serve food, drink, or have bathrooms I packed a little bag with some of Zapp's and a beer.  \n\nThis is the only venue in New Orleans where music wasn't blasted at us from speakers...there are no amps, mics, or ringing in the ears, just pure and simple jazz.  \n\nMy only regret is not having come here every night of our stay.",

  "text": "MMMM breakfast. I love it. I love everything about it. And Ghini's (for the most part) didn't disappoint. \n\nThis morning I had a sort of \"create your own combo\". I did two scrambled eggs with chopped up basil folded in, hash-browns, and biscuits with apricot jam. The eggs were incredible! Fluffy yet firm, but not overcooked. The basil was a perfect addition to fill out the flavor of otherwise bland eggs. The biscuits were pretty much out of this world. I'm going to say they were the best biscuits I've ever had. And the jam?! Oh the jam. Don't even get me started! The hash-browns on the other hand feel short. Not much flavor, soft, and sort of cold. I asked for them well done, but that didn't really happen, and that bummed me out a little. \n\nService was a little off too. It was busy- CRAZY busy, so I imagine they were strapped to get people seated and get food in their mouths timely, but I had to wait a little longer for a server to come over. Once he took my order though everything moved along like clock work. And so I'll hit em up again, it was breakfast well done. And next time I'll make sure the hash-browns are well done too!",

I have practiced with some of the top instructors in the world and taken yoga at the top yoga studios in New York and Los Angeles as well as doing three yoga teacher trainings with top studios like Yoga Works. This studio definitely meets my needs and reminds me of the large studios I use to practice with in L.A. It is such a wonderful vibe, amazing front desk staff who are very helpful, classes for every level, intelligent sequenceing ( which is important to avoid injury) and lovely teachers. I love Marley she has such  great energy and a caring heart. There are two showers and amenities when you come out after a hot sweaty workout. I took my boyfriend to a special workshop Roni was hosting and he walked out drenched and completely ZENed out! They have lots of workshops, a book club and a teacher training! They are even taking people to India for a retreat, which would be a dream to go to, next time! \n\nAll in all an amazing studio, I don't miss my big city studios when going here, a great place to practice!",

  "text": "I took my kiddos to incredible pizza today.  We haven't been here in years and thought we would give it a try.  It has definitely changed since the last time we were here.  For the worse.  The buffet was not good at all even compared to other buffets.  I think the reason I felt that way immediately was I got 3 buffets and a 25 dollar game card that ended up costing over 50 dollars.  Doesn't sound too bad to get 3 buffets and some games but once you get in and see the buffet and the prices of the games it isn't worth it.  The buffet was only half open and the pizza wasn't hot.  The kids didn't seem to care because they were excited to play games.  Once we finished eating we went to the game area and things got worse.  5 frames of bowling for two kids  = $7!!!  Terrible.  Two go cart rides that was less than 3 minutes = $8.  2 roller coaster rides = $13!!!!!!!!  15 minutes and 25 bucks was gone!  I will say the employees were friendly and smiled.  However, we won't be back simply because for that price there are way better things to do.",

  "text": "Bob Diehl is one of the best mechanics I've ever dealt with. I had a Mercedes Benz that I'd owned for years and only drove in the Summer months. It always started right up after being in storage for the Winter one year it was somewhat hard starting. I took it to the M-B dealer who kept it for three days and had the mechanic come and talk to me when I picked it up. The mechanic tried to convince me that there was nothing wrong and that was the way it should be, I asked around and learned about Bob. I brought the car to him, he fixed the problem and informed me that the car had three cold start systems and two weren't working right. Minor repairs set them right and the car stared as it always had. Bob charged me little or nothing for the work and I then became a loyal client. I eventually sold the car and was upset that Bob didn't work on any other marques. I understand that he may, now. \n\nI'd buy a used M-B if for no other reason than I'd know I'd have a great mechanic who could work on it. He is extremely knowledgeable, highly competent, and his prices are very reasonable.",

  "text": "Eh....Let's just say I'm glad this was not my only Jose Garces stop for the weekend.\n\nThe best thing about this place is the music. Absolutely awesome rock from the 60s, 70s and 80s. Tunes you know, tunes that sound like the hot sisters of tunes you know, tunes that take you back to when you played doctor with a Fisher Price stethoscope--yeah, music like that. I definitely did my fair share of Shazaaming and \"I gotta go back and listen to that album\"-ing.\n\nThe food itself was pretty mediocre. The boy and I did a weekend-long food tour of Philly and this was stop #65 or so, so we weren't extremely hungry coming in.\n\nWe came for the duckfat fries. But, well, they looked and tasted like normal fat fries except possibly on the drier side. The cheddar sauce helped a lot but I love french fries and believe good fries taste good without condiments of any kind, so the cheddar sauce wasn't too comforting to my fry-loving soul. We then split the chicken-fried steak. Holy oversalted batter, Batman! Waayyyy too much salty batter, about 0.23g of actual chicken. The gravy was okay but nothing remarkable and the biscuits were tender but too dense.\n\nI did love my cocktail, though. Got the Philadelphia Fish House Punch and it was a good, strong, sweet cocktail. Between that and the frat boy/bachelor party table next to us, I had a pretty good time here but definitely won't be coming back next time I'm in the city of brotherly love.",

Seriously smoky and delicious meats, especially the ribs and the brisket.  \n\nWe go here every now and then for the darn cheap brisket and pulled pork sandwiches and bring back a bunch for the office as well.  That always gets us some brownie points... :-)\n\nI hate to admit it, but I've never gotten any sides here before.  I don't even know if they HAVE sides their meats are so good.  And after all, isn't the point of BBQ the smoked meat?  \n\nI know this is a BBQ truck BUT it's a heck of a lot cheaper than Hungry Harry's (also GREAT bbq) but is of similar or slightly better flavor and quality.  \n\nIf you want to sit down to eat your bbq, just bring it back to your car and take a lean on the hood as you enjoy your brisket with the traffic whirring by.",

If Adam and Barbara Maitland from the movie \"Beetlejuice\" decided to open up a ghost version of a store post-becoming ghosts, this is what it might look like: everything's a little old and a little weird. I LOVE IT!!!\n\nDo you need an old portrait of a relative you've never had? What about a an old portrait of a relative you've never had with a preserved tarantula mounted on the print? Or one of dozens of found photos from varying eras of time? Or a taxidermy bear that's been mounted in the attack position? Yes? Then Anastacia's is the place for you! \n\nThis isn't the kind of place you go looking for something...it finds you. And I'm not exactly sure how many of these items are found \"as is\" or how many are helped along by the owners (for instance, was that ancient print of a scoliosis spine already in that super-ornate wooden frame that's probably an antique all on it's own and did it previously hang in some creepy doctor's office for a century, or did they decide to frame it, giving it a treasured and fancy presence behind the glass?), but every item is something special. I love the way they've curated so many bizarre items together without making the shopping experience overwhelming or fun-house-y. Everything here looks creep-ily treasured, as it should be.",

I'm young enough that this usually wouldn't be a problem, but I could definitely feel the metal for a few hours after the movie was over. The smell of the theater was definitely not the best either; something between stale popcorn and sweat.

By the way, I do realize McGwire took steroids but who didn't back then? It was the thing to do in the 90s! As was the Macarena. What a time to be alive!\n\nI met my brother here for a \"cheat day\" meal. I couldn't think of a better place to ruin all my hard work in the gym and in the kitchen than at this new southern cuisine hot spot in the Grove.\n\nIn order to get a taste of a few things we split a half hot chicken and half rack of BBQ pork ribs.  Our four sides: cornbread, Mac and cheese, fried potatoes, and greens.\n\nReview:\nHot chicken: unlike Lewis' other hot chicken place, Southern, this place only has one heat level. It's certainly spicy but not too spicy. As expected, the chicken was big, juicy, and crispy. It got my nose running and eyes watering. Loved it! It's pretty much what you'd get at Southern from what I could tell. That's good!  \n\nBBQ Ribs: Not overly meaty but plenty filling and topped with an excellent, sweet glaze. More than likely I'll be going for the hot chicken over the ribs from now on but that's 100% because the hot chicken is the Mayor of Flavor Town.\n\nFried potatoes: ours were fresh out of the oven. Very crispy, thick, and good seasoning.\n\nMac and cheese: not bad. Could have been more cheesy(everything in the world could be more cheesy, though, in my opinion). The crumble on top added a nice flavor.\n\nCornbread: Tasty. Not too sweet. More bread than corn...whatever that means...wink wink.\n\nGreens: I'm not a greens guy but my brother liked it.\n\nConclusion paragraph:\nI had high expectations going in. Especially since I've limited my carbs and calories for the last two weeks. A bad cheat meal would have = a sad Scott. However, I was very pleased with everything and highly recommend this to anyone looking to get some belt busting southern food!",

I realized why that is the case. There are better snowballs in New Orleans.\n\nThat's not to say this place is horrible. I've had better and I've had worse. That earns three stars from me.\n\nI got the jumbo size as I always do. They didn't quite put enough syrup in it, I saw a chunk of white ice where they missed a spot. I prefer a lot of syrup.\n\nThe other thing that turned me off was their setup. They have bars on their windows and they keep them shut except for when taking your order and giving you your snowball. The window that they hand you your snowball is completely covered with newspaper articles so you can't watch your snowball made. Then there's a sign saying, \"Please don't knock on the window.\" So it's like you can't check on your order if it's taking too long.\n\nMaybe they've been robbed there before or something but when I'm there I feel like I'm in a bank in a high crime area.",

  "text": "Dropped by for lunch after church because we were craving burgers.  Love the atmosphere and we got there before the rush.  Rustic wood and metal made the dining room feel warm and contemporary.  Music was hip and a few beards could be seen.  The bull horns over the bar and the abstract cow scene paintings felt like a ranch house.  We ordered the Black and Blue burger medium and the Salmon burger medium.  The salmon burger was visually and texturally perfect and a moist and tender medium but under seasoned.  The quality of the salmon was good and flavor was clean.  The Black and Blue burger was cooked perfectly and seasoned.  I like the buns, brioche style buttered and grilled so they are soft and crispy.  On a side note they served home made ketchup and Heinz so the kids have something familiar.  The home cut fries were great as usual and with the truffle oil made them perfect we also tried the special side which was a roasted red potato and grilled okra salad.  It had a mayonnaise base with seasoned salt sprinkled on top which was good but not my favorite.  I liked that the okra was left whole but may be better with the mayo seasoned with the seasoned salt.  \n\nOver all I like Burger Up they are consistently good but wish they would season as they cook.  The staff are friendly and the restaurant including the restrooms are clean.  Jeremy was our server, he was there when we needed him and close by when we didn't a perfect balance that allowed us to enjoy our family lunch.",

I show up at 3 pm for my scheduled appointment. I'm told that it will be an extra 15 minutes because they need to make a special order for my oil filter. I overhear one employee say to another, \"I was about to order that yesterday, but you know, people tend to not show up for their appointments, so I didn't order it.\" She then apologized. To the other employee. Not to me. One hour later (not 15 minutes later), a guy walks in and announces he has the oil filter. Now they can start doing the oil change, rather than an hour ago at the actual time of my appointment. Thank you for wasting the last hour of my life, Sears.",

There is no way I, or anyone for that matter, would have found this place if it weren't for someone just like you doing a review. Thanks guys!\n\nTucked away in a strip shopping center, albeit a cute shopping center, is this little non descript  restaurant. Since it was early in the day, we really weren't worried about a reservation although I did call as a just in case measure.\n\nWe wanted to sit outside since the back looks so pretty but were told it was closed but were led instead to an enclosed patio. Still nice. \n\nNicer still was when our server brought us bread, olive oil and a plate of marinated cannelloni beans with yellow and green squash. Wow! The squash were just a tad bland and needed salt but the beans were really flavorful.\n\nMy husband ordered the squash blossoms stuffed with ricotta and mozzarella cheese and I the beef carpaccio. Although I did miss capers on the beef and there was too much salad, both the dishes were really good.\n\nNow, our server gave us the list of specials and mentioned that two of them were served with langostines. I had seen these on one of the cooking shows but didn't know exactly what they were. My husband ordered the Carbonarra and I got the Langostines with a blush sauce served with lump crab and fresh tomato.\n\nMy dish was pricey, yes it was but incredibly worth it. Imagine a cross between a lobster, a shrimp and butter. Really. The langostines simply melt in your mouth leaving happiness behind. The carbonarra with panchetta instead of bacon my husband ordered is the best I've ever ordered or even tried to make. \n\nAs I've said, we were really early so we got to watch the prep of the restaurant between the the lunch and the dinner service. It was truly a privilege. These servers went through the place with precision, dusting, wiping, washing and primping every aspect of the restaurant. \n\nIf you go, and you should, bring a nice bottle of wine, order the langostines and the tiramisu. Enjoy!",

We arrived and chose where we wanted to sit. We were leisurely given menus and a long list of what they DIDN'T have on the menu. \n\nOur orders and our living social voucher were taken. Then there was apparently a problem with our voucher and a lot of back and forth w the waitress. Finally we were told it was ok but the waitress asked us for our order again bc she never put it in once there was a problem w the voucher! \n\nEventually the food came and it was just ok. I got the curry goat. It was mostly bones (large and small) and fat sadly, though the flavor was decent. It came with fried plantains which I love but these tasted like they had been reheated or microwaved or something. My husband got the jerk chicken which was full of little splinter bones. He had to be careful w every bite. He said the flavor was good but very spicy. \n\nI thought the prices seemed high considering the quality of the food and you get served water in disposable plastic cups (yet cloth napkins...). Also, you have to go outside to get to the bathroom which is pretty inconvient when it's raining out. Must be really annoying in the winter!\n\nAnother negative... No street parking in that area. Had to pay for a parking lot next door.\n\nI'm glad I went just to say I have been but I would definitely not go back.",

It was not busy, not another table was seated in our room. No music and our server took forever for everything, menus-15 minutes, drinks-20 minutes, food-30 more minutes, no refills, and it took forever for the check. We left cash because we were afraid to give a cc because it would have taken another 30 minutes to get it back. Skip this place!!",

  "text": "I usually do not eat at \"fast food places\" however this is an exception to my rule. Unlike other fast food chains that use selections of one or more, from the following categories: frozen; prepackaged foods; processed foods; meats that have added [artificially] growth hormones; products that contain pesticides; and artificial flavored and colored food products. The Panda Express uses fresh vegetables and the cooks make everything in woks as the orders are taken. The food is delicious and freshly made.\nAccording to the website: businessfranchise.com, The Panda Express is a franchised business.\nWikipedia documents, as of June, 2015, there are 1,746 locations in the USA and Puerto Rico.\nAndrew Cherng and his parents are from Jiangsu, a province in China. In 1973, Andrew and his father, Chef Ming Tsai Cherng opened their first restaurant in Pasadena, CA. Andrew dreamed of sharing his father's authentic recipes, for delicious Chinese cuisine, with the American people. Andrew also wanted to offer a choice of delicious entrées at inexpensive prices. As destiny intervened in Andrew's life, it just so happened that Andrew met Terry Donahue, the head football coach at UCLA and Dan Donahue who was Terry's brother, just so happened to have a Realtor company [Donahue Schriber Real Estate] that managed the Glendale Galleria, an upscale shopping center. Don offered Andrew the opportunity of a lifetime, to develop a fast-food version of his restaurant's entrées and his father's delicious recipes.\nAs fate would have it, this was just the beginning of Panda Express.",

It was cooked just how I asked (medium), but there wasn't a whole lot of guac on it, so I asked for a side, so I was happy! The garlic Parmesan  fries were not as good as I had expected. Not a lot of garlic or parm throughout the fries. Upon our second go-around of fries, the garlic and parm seemed more generous. I think I can do better if I try something on my own at home! I did enjoy some sweet potato fries and whatever it is that they serve it with, I need to find me some for home. It was a spicy type of ketchup dip,but ran more on the jelly/jam side.\n\nService was decent. At first our waitress was very present, but then when we needed drink refills (and more fries), she was nowhere to be seen. Otherwise she was pleasant and thought to bring us more napkins before we had asked. \n\nThe wait was about 25 minutes, but there were 5 of us and we asked for a table. Loud place, but not bothersome. I think I'll stick to Five Guys for my burger fix (but I would still come back here, though!)",

I wasn't sure what I'd find at Hendricks but I was pleasantly surprised as I was driving through the neighborhood. I liked the small town feel. Since I was by myself, I had planned on taking it to go and eating at the hotel but after walking inside, I had to stay to enjoy the decor. Light bulbs in mason jars, flat screen TV's and an amazing lighted patio. Although the view is just a parking lot, it's too bad it wasn't closer to the river behind it or had something else to look at. \n\nI ordered pork steak (which I've never heard of before) and it was really good. It looked like a T-bone but was tender enough to be cut with a fork. For my sides, I chose collard greens and cole slaw. The cole slaw was awesome. I have a weird ritual where I always order the cole slaw at different places to see how they make it. This one is definitely in my top 5. The slaw was finely chopped and had ground pepper in it, which I love. I usually put black pepper in my slaw anyways but this one was perfect. Cold and with a kick. Collard greens with a bit of bacon in it was good too. If I had more time or with a group of friends, I'd definitely come back because everything looked comfortably country.",

We were there within 20 minutes of ordering and it was ready. But the dining room was empty. For a Sat night that should have been a big clue. The rest of the places in the neighborhood were busy.\nThe steamed dumplings could have been great. The tasted homemade and the filling was good. However, they were so doughy with a really thick wrapper too thick that it detracted from the good filling. Everything else went downhill from there. \nThe beef and broccoli was inedible. The beef had an awful weird texture. Like it was boiled and was gelatinous.  The sauce on it had off flavors. We literally scraped it off our plates and threw the whole thing out.  The meat in both the general Tao's chicken and the orange beef also had weird textures. It was mushy and the coating was thick on those as well. The flavors in the sauces would have been fine, but they were gloopy.  The fried rice was fair but nothing memorable.\nWe won't be going back.",

  "text": "After reading a lot of positive reviews, we were really excited to try this place. We were extremely disappointed in the food. I'm going to give the place the benefit of the doubt that it is not always like this as we came in at 10 PM, but if you cannot offer quality food at that hour then don't have your kitchen open. \nAll of our food came out within 5 to 10 minutes of ordering which leads me to believe it was not made fresh. The Caesar salad was room temperature and overdressed. The hush puppies were flavorless, and the chicken wings (3 full wings is a serving) were undercooked and barely warm. The only redeeming food item was the chicken and biscuits, which had a nice flavor profile- the biscuit was again, cold in spots. \n\nOn the positive side the place has a nice hip atmosphere and the service is friendly. \n\nUnfortunately, the food was so sub par we would not consider dining here again.",

The only thing that the owners and bartenders care about are the gamblers that get over-served and gamble there daily.   I'm definitely gonna stay away from that part of town after 4ish as that's when the \"heavy hitters\" come in to support the greasy, dirty, place that really only cares about their gamblers.  The kitchen has some kinda mold issues that literally smells like a sewer plant.  The 2 gals that have made a career outta this dump rely on the drunkards to tip them \"big\" if they win on the slots.  This is a very sad version of any kinda chicken joint or sports bar.  The greed that the owners share is obvious as flat screens are cheap these days and these guys can't even loosen their hands on the \"gambling profit\" to invest in to this dump.   Is sad as the original owners did a great job and these new guys don't care about anything except the profit from the slot machines, including the nasty food they serve.  The bartenders are high-strung and anything but friendly, unless of course, you are gambling big and they have a chance at a big tip.  \nYour better off going to the fast food chicken joint across the stree t\"El Pollo Loco\" and guessing the kitchen is cleaner and the staff is friendlier and you won't be subjected to the daily drunks that drive to and from this place daily.

The minute I met the owner, I knew she was not only very well informed about how to brew a great cup of coffee, but also knows how to make the toughest of customer a repeat patron. This coffee is so good that I buy 5#s at a time from Brigitte. It is always fresh and she has even delivered coffee to me while she is under construction of her new place. Personally, I cannot wait until she opens her new location. I never did care much for the Hollander Hotel and I often felt that she was being stifled by the cramped space she worked in. Also, the hotel has a funky smell (sort of like old socks) so I will be glad when she is at her new location and I can sit and enjoy a good cup of coffee without trying to filter out the bad smell from the hotel. I know it will be a long line at the new location but it will be worth the wait.... Thanks Brigitte for showing St. Petersburg what real coffee tastes and smells like!",

The entrees were good, the prices were spot on, and the breadsticks were delicious.\n\nAhh, the breadsticks. This is where the attitude part kicks in. These things are advertised as \"as much as you want for free.\" However, my buddy heads up to the front counter to request enough for our table of three only to be given a hard time from the manager that we're eating more breadsticks than what we ordered. Give me a break. Don't advertise what you don't want to deliver.\n\nEven ordering was a chore. It seemed as if they had a new hire manning the register during the lunch hour rush. She was placing orders as to-go for people looking to dine-in and had to have the manager place orders for her. Not a good idea for a Friday lunch rush.\n\nIf this Fazoli's location can improve upon these things minor inconveniences, it'd be a great place to grab a quick bite.",

It's a very cool, very like-minded crowd.\n\nFood wise you can't go wrong with duck fat french fries. I feel like I don't even need to say that, because come on... duck. fat. french. fries. We also go for the cheese puffs on their late night menu as well: a hot pan of ping-pong ball sized bread balls coated in cheese and broiled and delicious and... oh boy now I'm, hungry.\n\nAnd if the other reviews aren't clear enough... their burgers will have you singing hymns of praise to the meat gods.",

My son and I had something called the wildflower triple that had scrambled eggs, bacon, and a waffle.  The waffles were very yummy were tender with the perfect golden crisp to them.  The bacon was a great balance of crispy without being over cooked.  \n\nPrices seemed reasonable to me, most items in the $5-8 range if I remember correctly.  Mine was $7.75 I think.\n\nOne last note is that they had good portion sizes.  The portion sizes are filling, without being super sized.  I was afraid when I order something called a triple it would be WAY too much food (even though the price was inline with other items on the menu).  It was two eggs, two pieces of bacon, and a deep pocket waffle the size of a coaster.  If you like huge portions of food look elsewhere.",

The wings are fried, and then soaked in sauce. To me, I wouldn't even call it sauce on most of them. It was more like oil, grease or the like. They didn't taste too bad. The parmesan wings didn't taste as good as they looked, but it was so-so for me. On my three visits there, I had the ten wings combo (with fries and drink). The supposedly hot wings weren't as spicy (sorry guys I've had better...). The crinkle cut fries were alright as well. I did use them to dip into the leftover wing sauce on the plate. Which brings me to a point: this is probably the first wing place that I visited that doesn't offer dipping sauce (like ranch and blue-cheese). But I got by. Plus I had the blasting Top 40 music to keep me less bored. All in all, it was A-OK.",

  "text": "The food here was good, but nowhere near competes with other restaurants in the French Quarter. We wandered in because we couldn't find anywhere else. \n\nIt's unclear how you're supposed to find a table, but customers are just supposed to grab a table. There's a sort-of line that forms by the bar, but no one working there organizes it at all.\n\nWe sat down quickly, but I think it was just lucky timing because for the rest of our meal people were waiting to sit. Also, there's only one bathroom and it took FOREVER to use it. They seriously need to have more than just one bathroom.\n\nI ordered the crab cakes florentine, which were really good. The potatoes needed more spice (aka hot sauce) but the meal was really flavorful. The chef cooked the eggs perfectly, but there was nothing to scoop up the runny egg with since there was no bread. My friend ordered the french toast and it was not impressive. Just a few slices of bread with cinnamon and some egg on top. Not filling or visually stunning. \n\nOur waitress was not particularly nice and seemed angry with us when we didn't want to order drinks. Many people did seem to have their food and then get a drink to-go as they walked around Jackson Square. \n\nI'd say you should go here if you're really hungry and can't find anywhere else. But otherwise, skip it and do the research for a better place.",

  "text": "This is a great late brunch option during the weekends when the big morning rush dies down after 1 pm. Usually there is no wait or 5 minute wait at this time. One big complaint is that they don't have an organized system for seating guests. The servers don't always greet incoming patrons (which should be required Waffle House-style) and they sometimes tell you to seat yourself (which can lead to one or two people taking up tables for 4) or they'll seat you (whenever they get around to talking to you). \n\nI've ordered a several different dishes at this point and they have varies from ok to awesome. The chicken wings and onion rings are just ok. The wings are either lightly dredged in flour or not at and then fried whole. They aren't really seasoned so the wings are pretty bland. The \"onion rings\" made of formed, chopped onions that are breaded. The chicken fingers were a bit over battered and dry. The smashwich (or whatever it's called) was pretty good: your choice of breakfast meat with hash browns and eggs in a hoagie roll, but unspectacular. The club sandwich is classic diner fare that is very well executed. The egg and omelette platters are a very good deal and dang tasty. The best thing on the menu is definitely the waffle. It's gently sweet, very crispy and covered in butter. So good!\n\nThe service is generally pretty attentive (once you're seated), the restaurant and bathrooms are very clean, the food is a good, tasty value",

  "text": "This is the biggest and best location for HMV in the city. The prices aren't any different from other stores but they do have a larger selection of gifting (figurines,mugs,blankets etc) as well as the largest collection of titles that don't fit into what is new and hot at the moment. Anything that they don't carry can actually be ordered in for you but I have to say staff here are not always the best at phoning customers to let them know when their titles are in so one should definitely keep their number by the phone to check in with them after a week or so.\n\nThe biggest selling point for me here besides the selection has to be the staff at the tills. It can get a little busy here but lines are always dealt with quickly and I appreciate that they don't push as hard as other locations to try and sign you up for a pure card. F.Y.I to anybody considering the pure rewards program the redemption items are not that great. It took me about a year of collecting just to accumulate enough points for a true blood key chain and when I got it it was placed in a bubble mailer and not even in it's original packaging. Needless to say when it came time to renew the card I opted out.\n\nAnyways to sum it all up I will say for selection and speedy service these guys get five stars but the prices as well as the sometimes slow ordering process drop it down to a 3. Still worth checking out though if you have been on the hunt at smaller stores for a particular movie or cd.",

  "text": "Sbraga: good, but not great. I dined here on a Saturday evening and ordered the four course tasting menu with some friends. We were seated promptly and the service was great. I ordered the fried green tomatoes with smoked shortbreads and cumin aioli, sea bream with rustic bread salad and hummus, meatloaf with bacon marmalade and the chocolate mousse taste with pistachio ice cream. My first two courses were excellent. It was my first time eating shortbreads, and I was pleasantly surprised. The sea bream dish was light and very tasty. However, I felt things fell short with the meat course and the dessert. The texture of the meatloaf was too crumbly, and I think I prefer my meatloaf to be a little more solid. It also seems that they included olives in their bacon marmalade and the taste of the marmalade was just too vinegary for me. And as for the dessert, it was just ok. I was able to taste the other desserts my friends ordered, and I was not really impressed by them, either. Also of note, almost every dish that came out was liberally garnished with dill-not that I mind dill, but after the third course, that was a lot of dill. Overall, it was a good meal. But for $49 dollars, I don't know if I would necessarily come back.",

Went to Target, bought a coat but ended up taking it bath. Was not my dream coat. Next stop Ross. The only coat in my size was a beautiful Bomber style jacket made of pleather. Bought it right before Christmas. Now it's a few days after Christmas and my husband Guy points out to me that the coat is really wrinkled. I go on line and look up every possible hack to get wrinkles out of pleather. They all fail miserably. I just went back to Ross with that coat, no receipt, no tags and asked to speak to the manager. The manager is a young male with dark hair and black framed glasses. I tell him of my plight. He literally says go find what you need, no problem. WOW! You won't believe it, but there was my Camouflage coat, in my size, hanging there waiting for me. Oh the irony! They exchanged my coat and after all that I ended up with my Dream coat after all.

  "text": "Philadelphia, I love you.  Places like this remind me why.  We sat at the counter and watched the guys make the pizzas.  Our son hates cheese on a pizza and they had one already on the menu for him: The Marinara (oregano, crushed san marzano tomatoes, garlic, olive oil).  It was simple... but delicious. If you like real wood-fired pizzas that char the crust (a little blackened... in a good way), this is the place to go to.  Our other favorite pizza joints that rival this place are Lombardi's (NYC) and Grimaldi's (Brooklyn).  We all had a slice and were shocked at the lovely simplicity of it. Razor thin slices of garlic dotted the fresh tomato sauce.  My husband and I shared the Salsiccia (fennel sausage, roasted fennel, tomato sauce, mozzarella).  Roasted fennel on a pizza?  Brilliant. I cried a little.  No wait... I REALLY cried when we shared this cocktail: The Brooklyn (Dad's Hat rye, Luxardo cherry, white vermouth).  It says it serves one, but they brought it out in a cute little bottle and gave us each a glass...each with a hand- crafted giant square ice cube (hipster-cool) and Luxardo cherries.  Perfection.  We also shared a Rotolo (pizza dough, mortadella, ricotta, pistacchio pesto).  Those are crazy amazing.  I kept saying my husband could eat the rest... then freaking out and going back for another bite. He's lucky I didn't stab him in the hand with a fork to fight over the last bite (to be fair, he was the smart one who ordered it).  I could've eaten several of those and forgotten the pizza (although that was wonderful too!).  We finished with a little dessert... perfect little Italian cookies (\"Cookie Jar\" - pignoli, almond cookies, chocolate biscotti, pistacchio gnocchi) and I got an Affogato (fiordilatte soft serve with a shot of espresso).  The soft serve is Italian sweet cream... decadent and lovely... with rich espresso in a pretty little Italian mug.  I'm in Heaven here.  I know nothing about Vetri's other restaurants, but I'm checking them out next time I'm in Philadelphia!  By the way... service was great and friendly.  5 stars all around!",

Great supply of tackle an honestly some of the best prices I've seen. I used to buy a lot\nOf my tackle at Walmart ( yes I've regretted that ) or dicks. After learning the error of my ways, an seeing the really great prices I've been buying all of my tackle from this shop. You can't go wrong with this bait shop ! The only issue I have is there isn't more of them around town !!!",

  "text": "When giving friends from out of town a tour of the French Quarter, one can only expect they want some classic New Orleans dishes. I've been here a couple of times, but they were the ones that wanted to go, due to their lunch special. It's a nice, well know restaurant that offers a 17.00 lunch special that includes a soup or salad, entree, and the option for a 4.00 Bloody Mary or martini. I got the Bloody Mary and it was a great size for the price. It was spicy and hit the spot.\nThey text message you when your table is ready, so were able to walk around the quarter while we waited. Thank god a lot of restaurants are getting rid of the those buzzers that make you feel like you are under house arrest. \nWe sat down to a beautiful table right by the open shutters. The servers, were ok. They were busy, but forgot a couple of things we asked for. It was still a great experience though!\nI got the pork chop with red beans and the turtle soup. The turtle soup was one of the best I have had. The pork chop was cooked to perfection and the read beans were seasoned very well. It came with cornbread, but it was very dry. After this lunch at noon, I didn't find myself hungry till it was basically time for bed. It was a very generous portion and well worth the money.\n\nMuriel's is a great way to get a classic, good quality New Orleans meal at a decent price. The location is spectacular, and the history behind the restaurant made for great conversation at the table.\nDefinitely check it out if you are in the Quarter!",

  "text": "Gluten free pasta...I had to try. Plus, 1/2 price wine Mon-Thurs did not disappoint.  The selection was just right.\n\nWe found street parking as the lot was full, and at 7pm waited a bit for a table as they don't accept reservations for parties of less than 6.\n\nTo start, we ordered the Escargot, and it came from the kitchen screaming hot. So hot, the cheese had broken. I was looking forward to the crunchy brown bits to munch on but only had a couple of small bits that survived.  As a celiac, I couldn't dunk for the garlic butter, and they didn't bring any bits for my dining companion to dunk after I had finished.  Our server was MORE than helpful, we could have asked, but wondered if this was how it was usually served.\n\nNext I ordered the daily special - squid, mussels and shrimp with a garlic butter sauce and gluten free penne corn pasta.  I'm not usually a fan of a single ingredient gluten free pasta - corn tends to be a bit dry and fussy.  Tonight was not much of an exception.  \n\nTasty? Oh my YES. But again, without (gluten free) bread or bun to soak up that beautiful garlic butter sauce - a bit sad.  The seafood was cooked to perfection, and I don't get to say that very often.  The penne... well, stab it with a fork and some broke in half. A large spoon would have been a great addition to the dish for scooping.  I think I managed OK, because I ate almost all of it and forgot to take pictures!\n\nMy dining companions all finished their meals and had desserts which looked fantastic - tiramisu was beautiful and large! Some would share it, but for others, it's just right. \n\nBe prepared to leave by 9:30pm on a Thursday, as the cleaners apparently come soon after! (I've never heard that before, but...Ok.)\n\nNot every establishment can handle gluten free ingredients or diners, but they did well.  They weren't certain if the gelato was safe, and probably cross-contamination from others might be an issue, so good call by our waitress.  I'm looking forward to the single serving packages of buns from certain gluten free bakers (wink wink) that might make it easier for restaurants to thaw only one at a time (yes, you have to keep them frozen until serving - they get dried out, inedible and gross pre-thawed).\n\nI believe we will return to try more items on their menu.",

So I'm giving it a 4 star because these people have pushed it to the very point of being as Cajun/NOLA/Southern as they can with the demographic thats around. Anything more involving fried oysters, more crawfish, more fried anything, hard cajun spices, LSU and Saints decor, the locals wouldn't come. So I give them a thumps up for making it as close as Carmel-Indy will allow to stay in business.\n\nNow the food, its good. Not awesome, but I don't expect it to be. I had the pick three; Crawfish Casserole, Gumbo and Jambalaya. All fair sizes, all had a little kick. I would go again on my way through Carmel. More of a lunch place than dinner, but thats up to you.\n\nI hope they stay open and continue to grow.\n\nLaissez les bons temps rouler !",

You need books, you need a place to browse, talk with other book lovers, and listen to book readings. Indy Reads is that place. And it's more than that because all proceeds support a great cause, adult literacy. Most of the books are used so donate a book and pick up a new (used) one. You may be surprised at all the books they have that you didn't even know you wanted. They also have a small selection of new books. If they don't have what you're looking for, you can order it. The one thing I don't really like is that the $1 children's books can be jammed so tightly that it's hard to look through them. The kids books are also arranged by color, which makes it harder for me to distinguish between titles as I glance through. Prices are excellent throughout, and the space is really nice.

You were wonderfully accommodating, and  I promised I'd mention that server Dan P was especially attentive and accommodating of our crowd.\n\nI think the drinks came perfectly balanced, which is very nice. Sometimes you love when drinks come strong, but they're not necessarily delicious. Here, you get booze, but also scrumptiousness. You treated our group to kamikazes--- thanks, they were great!\n\nAlso, in addition to a plethora of drinks, we got the nachos and the \"awesome fries.\" These were fantastic, like over-the-top perfect for satisfying grease cravings while drinking... DELICIOUS. Even without happy hour specials, this was a great night for service, food, drinks, and the game- thanks for having both soccer and football on screens all over the freaking place. :)",

Our turtle sundae didn't have any caramel in it - you know -one of the main ingredients, my Christy had the worst iced brownie in it if ever tasted - total bargain basement, still frozen, so bad even a little Debbie brownie would have been a massive upgrade & the Smore was a pretty light on toppings, pretty sad excuse...

  "text": "A healthy and refreshing alternative to an unhealthy NOLA treat.  Beaucoup Juice offers a variety of snoballs, smoothies, and even sandwiches.  All their treats are made with freshly squeezed juices, so you don't have to worry about getting a major sugar rush.  I came here with my sister one afternoon looking for a healthy treat.  I ordered the pineapple mint snoball and she got the Mardi Gras Mango smoothie.  We both enjoyed our yummy treats!  The pineapple mint was so unique and refreshing.  I love when places mix mint with other fruits!\n\nIf you're looking for a traditional snoball, this is not the place for you!  You can find a delicious, sugar-filled snoball at Hansen's if you're looking for that.\n\nBeaucoup Juice is very cute and small.  I find it to be a sort of hipster/retro place with its bright colors and art.  I will definitely be back whenever I have a craving for snoballs.",

  "text": "I originally gave b.good a 4 star review and it was basically: If you're in the market for a burger, salad, or kale/quinoa bowl that's made with real & not-processed ingredients, go to b.good. I also gave them props for the fact that even their sodas and condiments didn't have HFCS or artificial ingredients. I was disappointed that the value of the meal seems a little lackluster, being quite pricey for what you get.\n\nI have to knock this original review from 4 stars to 3 stars though because b.good is consistently slow in getting your food ready for you and the friendliness of the service is typically iffy, depending on who's serving you though. And yes, I know you can do online ordering to help with the wait times but as far as I'm concerned, there's no reason why you should have to do online ordering for 'fast food'.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, b.good is trying to market themselves as real fast food. The food is real, but it's definitely not fast, and I don't know if it warrants the prices they're charging with the service they provide. That and considering how there are so many awesome/similar eateries in that shopping center already (like Zoes Kitchen, Chipotle, & Panera Bread), it's hard for me to keep b.good at a 4 star.",

I had an issue with a warrantied battery replacement, and it turned out that I owed a portion of the battery costs after they submitted the claim. They didn't call me and tell me that I owed them the money. They just noted it on my file until the next time I came in for service, which wasn't until months later--they didn't have to wait like that, but they did without me even asking.  The shop is super clean, the owners are super nice, and they always have Corvettes, Vipers, Lotus, Jaguars, classic cars, or some other expensive car that they are working on or selling.",

  "text": "If you're reading this review you're most likely one of the following: somewhat new to the Pinellas County area, a snowbird looking for Honda service, new to the world of Honda, or you broke up with Honda years ago and realized it's time to go back to the best car you've probably ever owned...\n\nWhatever the case, you're looking to avoid the trek into Tampa, right? This means you've got two options, AutoNation or Crown. Based upon personal experience (this happened to both my brother and husband), if you head to AutoNation first, you'll probably find yourself purchasing from Crown. Here's why. \n\nFrom Service to Sales, They're There to Help.\nIronically, I was helping Mom clean her three-year-old CRV interior. Her New York-dealership lease was up in two months (she moved here two years ago and needed to find a new trusted Honda dealership). Once the interior seats were clean, we were ready to hit the car wash. Boom. The three-year old battery died leaving us stuck in my driveway.\n\nHonda roadside assistance towed the car to the dealership - at no charge of course. Crown offered to replace the battery for free allowing her time to think about her next move. Regardless, I was confident we'd roll out in a new Honda, but didn't want her to worry. She's dealt with Michelle and Brooks in service several times and knows they're both awesome, so having had positive experiences with them helped.\n\nNo Real Pressure. No Real Up-Sell.\nKaren handled our lease deal with management assistance from Vinny. She listened and understood that Mom, a senior, is far from tech savvy - bells and whistles scare her. Mom no longer deals with ice and snow - no need for four-wheel drive and needs to feel comfortable on the road. Her previously-leased 2012 Civic was too tight and too low to the ground. With all of this in mind, they set her up with a standard-feature H-RV crossover vehicle to reach her price point, style and comfort requirements. \n\nJustin Simplifies the Finance Process\nYou've found your ideal car thanks to Sales, now it's time to pay up. Oy, the stress, right? No. Justin puts you at ease with humor, warmth, and banter knowing the stress involved in coughing up the cash. When we told tell him Mom obviously didn't need a top-of-the line coverage plan on a leased car, but only trusts the dealership for service, he worked with her...\n\nReady to Rock and Roll\nRegardless of the dealership closing in thirty minutes, Karen sat with us in Mom's new H-RV and walked her through each and every feature. From actually setting up and testing her iPhone speed dial numbers via bluetooth, to setting up her quick-find favorite soft rock radio stations - every question was answered. I've had this with Volkswagen, but Mom said she's never experienced that with Honda. \n\nOverall Positive Customer Experience \nWe left feeling great about the purchase. We liked getting to know the staffs' personal background - where they're from, details about their families, etc. Enjoyed complimentary cups of tea, coffee, cocoa, and bottled water - car shopping is serious business. We were there for four hours - keeping hydrated is key. Another reviewer said they make you feel like family and honestly, they did. \n\nSweet Sidenote\nCrown apparently loves animals. While out on the lot, we had the pleasure of meeting Oliver, a local orange and white outdoor-cat. Though his owner lives near the dealership, Oliver's made Crown his second home and the crew doesn't seem to mind sharing the outdoor space with him one bit. Loved this!",

They are the outer parts of a grilled chicken breast with no moisture and very few of them.\nHaving met the owner in the past and having his wife wait on me I knew something wasn't right.\nI explained to the waitress that this dish had changed and wasn't good! She politely offered something else. What to order...if they had modified a basic dish what was next?\nTo my surprise a male manager came out and \"informed\" me that this is exactly what they had been serving for 10 years and I must have either special ordered something or was mistaken.\nI said this is not what they had served me for the past 5 years and I never had requested a special order before. \nI also asked what they had done to the phenominal soft tacos? They were usually served in a soft warm flour tortilla and had moisture and flavor. Tonight they were stale and crisp and the filing was bland.  Again he informed me I was mistaken while he held my order that had been sent back to the kitchen in front of me.\nI apologized and said I didn't wish for anything else, thank you.\nAnother manager came out a few moments later apologizing and stated that they are unfamiliar with what I had ordered and would \"special order\" anything I wanted. I declined.\nApparently their cook walked out tonight and they were winging it.\nToo bad it was a good place to get a good mexican meal.\nTwo thumbs down on Poblano's.",

Our egg drop soup came out right away at a nice piping hot temperature and when the rest of our food came out it was practically room temperature. \n\nFeeling adventurous, I had ordered the Shrimp with Candied Walnuts entree with brown rice while he ordered the Sesame Chicken platter. I like the idea of sharing food, but my food was too busy all on its own without adding something else to the mix. The brown rice was cold and very bland while the shrimp was overly sweet and I didn't feel like the candied walnuts and melon balls were complementary flavors.\n\nThe chocolate cake we had for dessert was amazing though; 6 layers of chocolate on chocolate. It was so sweet and rich, we ended up sharing a slice.\n\nSo to sum up, service was great, dessert was great, but the food needs some work. Sorry PF Changs, I just am not impressed.\n\nOne thing I will note (that our server told us) is that they are very big on catering to food allergies (especially gluten).",

Kid portions are small, but I have kids on the older side of kid menu appropriateness. Adult pizzas were spectacular. I had the wild mushroom (with added bacon). Other adult was a different veggie Pizza, also very good. Kids described the pepperoni as just right in spiciness, with a nice crispiness.  All in all, we enjoyed it and will return.

I got jalepeno poppers which were by far the best i've ever had, although they were a little pricey.\n\nI also ordered a small plain pizza, and after I finished off the poppers I opened up the pizza and realized there were mushrooms on it.  I was alright with that, to me I just got lucky with a free topping, but if it had been some kind of meat I would have been pretty bummed (I'm a vegetarian).  The pizza was really tasty, Crust was a little softer then I prefer but it was real good. I will definitely order from here again, maybe not for a little while just cause it is more expensive then other places.\n\nAlso delivery was fast, and the guy called me right when he got to my house. A big problem I have with delivery places is when they call before they actually get to your house, cause I live pretty far out in the ghetto and I don't like standing around outside after they call... but these guys were right out front when they called me.",

  "text": "While there's better BBQ to be had in the Bay Area, this joint was nearby and is in a great location for people watching and walking around Main street in Safety Harbor. It works in a pinch if you're in the mood for pork! \n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered combos, both including pulled pork and spare ribs. While the ribs were smoked and tasty, they were a little tough compared to what we're normally used to. My boyfriend happened to like the pulled pork, but I felt that I could've made better at home. It was bland and seemed like it didn't have any seasoning at all. \n\nThe sides don't offer too much to chose from. There is a variety of \"dressing-\" covered starches, like potato and macaroni salads, but the only worthwhile side we tried was the cornbread pudding. I highly recommend it if you find yourself here. It's more of a bread than pudding and is at a sweetness level that can be enjoyed as a side instead of dessert. \n\nNow for the most important part, the sauces! One was a vinegar based spicy concoction that we mostly stayed away from and there was another \"mango\" flavored one that barely tasted like the fruit. The best is their sweet sauce, which is thick and similar to Sweet Baby Rays but with a little extra kick. It was great! \n\nThe service, location and pretty much everything else was pretty good, but unfortunately, we felt the BBQ could've been better and that there could've been more side selections like french fries or mac'n'cheese.",

The environment, the decor, the air inside is so much better to start. The food taste so much more fresher, like it was not frozen or reheated. No greasy/oily after taste. The service is very good,  always right there when you need something, staff is very friendly. My family and I love Mae's and what makes it better are the prices. We're large family and we can do really well with just $60. Lunch specials are awesome! I encourage you to try Mae's.",

I was impressed with all of the exhibits and information available. There were so many things for the kids to play with. Lots of family restrooms, which made it easy for our large family and free parking was definitely a plus.\n\nThe only con was the cafeteria. It is not set up to be very user friendly at all. I think it's needs to have a better lay out with better information to explain where to get all the different kinds of food or just make one area to get the food instead of having to wait in 5 different lines.",

The wings were on the small side. Aside from that they were not crispy and I didn't taste any honey in the sauce. I'd probably order them again but make sure you specify extra crispy. The pizza however, was awesome. I got the Parma. I made sure they added the arugula AFTER the pizza was cooked. It was so good that even though I'm stuffed I can't wait until I'm hungry again so I can enjoy my leftovers!  They also had a twisted pretzel beer that tasted like a pretzel!!!  It was so good and not heavy even though it was a dark beer. Make sure to go next door and get some gelato for dessert.",

I was stressed the whole time I was there,  as was my wife, it used to be fun, now it sucks.We eat at some of the restaurants weekly , but we are done. Now they want to re-do the lot and charge to park , what the hell is wrong with these greedy Indians or whoever is running this scam.Talk about driving people away, I know they don't care because its always packed house, the clientèle however has dropped to thugs and lowlifes. The parking garage is nasty like New Jersey...garbage all over,  stinks, gum on the ground, just shit. Now should I tell you what I really think??",

  "text": "As much as I like chicken wings and local restaurants here in Tucson, I don't know how many more times i can stand WOB. As for the wings they are great, always large and perfectly crispy, and totally drenched in sauce. I haven't tried anything else on the menu that I can vouch for. My issue with this place is the service, on the phone it always seems like an inconvenience that I am calling in an order and the call is always rushed. And in person when we are feeling daring enough, the staff always looks like they are in the weeds or behind on all their work. What has brought me to write this review is the mid 30 looking, tall server. Her attitude is unnecessary, her guest interaction screams lack of training and her aura if this counts for anything seems like a black cloud moving through the restaurant. I don't usually let service bother me as long as the food holds up but I just don't like her. And that's that. I'll finish up this dozen of hot, wipe my fingers and contemplate dining in again.",

Yes, some of the high end designer clothes are still pricy anyway you look at it, but still a super deal.  I tend to go into \"overload\" in discount places such as this with large inventories, but the critical difference between UAL and other places is the service that is received.  I was amazed when I walked in to have someone come immediately up to me, tell me about the place , where things are located and offer any assistance.  Melody, the owner was there today and she worked with me to assure that I found just what I was looking for, brought clothes to the dressing room and suggested that I try on things that I never would have chosen if I was on my own.  I walked out with a great summer dress for 39.00, some Velvet camisoles and great jewelry.  This place is a find!  I will be going back regularly to feed my new UAL addiction.",

However, the Piasa Bird is a part of local tradition and a must-see for anyone traveling on the Great River Road.

So after we corrected him and picked up or pizza, we got back and opened it up and it was ALL SAUSAGE. This is the second time in the past month i have had terrible service. The first time i got there for pickup and they had completely forgotten to put my order in. Terrible.",

  "text": "1  Fried Meat Dumplings  $ 5.25\n1  General Tso's Dinner Box  $ 7.75\n\nI gave this a four stars but let me clarify. It is what it is. It's greasy unhealthy American-Chinese food thats cheap and has way too much salt. You know they don't serve general tso's in China right? But for what it is it's a cheap and solid dinner. The General Tso's Dinner box is is a typical combo of egg roll rice and the chicken. It's pretty good but I'd only say it's an average 3 stars, nothing sticks out. The real reason I order from Golden Chopsticks quite often is their fried meat dumplings. These are the thick heavy doughy dumplings, not the thin potstickers you might be used to and you get 8 with an order for less than 6 bucks. It's a lot of food and make sure you sleep with water next to your bed because it's very salty, in a good way. So again for what they are aiming for, they do a pretty decent job. Don't skip on the dumplings!",

You literally walk in and no longer feel like you are in Indiana. Everything is sparkly and glittery, and the smells are divine. \n\nWe made the trek by uber to this neighborhood and really wanted to try this place! We arrived around 11 for an \"early lunch\" slash \"snack\". We ordered the quiche of the day which was quiche Lorraine and the famous Earls Court Chocolate Cake.\n\nThe quiche was quite delicious. The egg was so fluffy and savory while the crust was super flaky and had a great bacon flavor.  This was a perfect snack to split between 2 people and just hit the spot!\n\nIt was so hard to decide which cake to try. One gripe that I have about this place is the price of the cake slices. The slices are quite large and pricey. If you only come with 2 people it is hard to get a few things to share without either breaking the bank or stuffing your face with dessert. I asked if we could do 1/2 slices, but was politely denied. A suggestion I have would be to allow fractions of slices so people can try multiple different cakes.\n\nMy wife loves chocolate and I love all sweets so we opted for the famous chocolate cake. There was so much great chocolate flavor and for the most part, the cake was super moist. It seemed like the edges of the cake might have been a little over cooked/on the dryer side but the flavor was delightful!",

And there are better and better deals the more you show up, just like any other grocery store. I'd rather get some things here than anywhere else in town. AJ's is a place to explore more. And there are no homeless people or ghetto customers in line , which I love!\n\nI probably can't or won't shop here too often since, you know, I like to pay rent and bills and stuff.

There is a ton to choose from, even if you're vegetarian.  \nFormalities first--why can't there be some ambiance at Indian restaurants.  I know I'm painting with broad strokes here, but it seems like outside of NYC, no Indian restaurant in the US can get creative with their dining space.  Not sure why that is, but whatever.\nAn early arrival on a Sunday found the place quiet, with maybe 10 or so people dining.  No problem getting a table for 2.  We started the evening off with some garlic Naan.  Delicious, although I think next time I'll stick with regular, at almost half the cost.  We also got some Finger Paneer, little spiced fried cubes of cheese.  These were denser than typical Paneer.  The cheese was slightly bland, but the spices were good.  Overall, an enjoyable start to the meal.  I also had a lemonade, which may have been made fresh.  Regardless, it was tasty. \nEntrees included Paneer Bhurji and Lamb Shahi Korma.  We elected \"spicy\" as our seasoning level.  I'll admit, I have a pretty strong ability to deal with spiciness.  But this was some ultra-spicy food when it arrived!  We quickly ordered a mango lassi to help put out the fire.  Still, even through the spices, there were decent flavors coming through.  The nutiness of the Korma was especially nice, as was the blended creaminess.\nI'm intrigued enough to return for more offerings.  I am humbled however by their spiciness--something that has not happened to me in many many years.  Next time, I am going to stick with \"medium\" spiciness!",

They rotate their flavors regularly and if at first you don't see a topping you'd like be sure and ask if they have it because they keep some under the counter!\n\nThis place also busts out some pretty intense EDM music over their sound system, which is somewhat bizarre but wholly awesome!",

The goat with the sweet curry and gnocchi was very different and I loved it. I had a bite of the lime cheesecake and it was top notch, too. \n\nNo drinks, because it's 2 days after Mardi Gras and I'm still in recovery mode.

  "text": "I went here on a Wednesday night and, though it wasn't busy, there were no open tables without a reservation,  except the tall tables in the bar area. It still seemed to be a very quiet place anyway. \n\nThe location is not attractive, the street is dark and mostly empty at night, but the inside is stylish in a masculine, refined sort of way; dark wood, low light, maps on the walls and prints of watercolors depicting old Missouri scenes. It was a great place for a quiet, intimate dinner. They've got a couple of TVs up above the bar. \n\nThey seemed very well staffed, as if each table had its own server. \n\nThe menu is one page but very intriguing, I had so many questions for our server about \"what is this?\" and \"what is that?\" and he was totally nice and knowledgeable about the menu items. He seemed nervous and unsure at first, but he was friendly and made sure to check on us frequently. \n\nWe decided to split 3 small plates and a side dish between the two of us and, honestly, it was a little too much food for just two people. Perhaps we don't have hearty enough appetites.\n\nTheir menu is so varied and interesting, it's really all over the map in terms of seasonings and ethnic origins but the main focus seems to be rustic and warming - at least at this time of year. I have a feeling they may change it up from time to time. I'm sure you'll get things here you won't find anywhere else. The prices are very reasonable, considering the planning and good execution of the food. You'd certainly find more expensive, and less original places in Clayton and down town. \n\nWe ordered the smoked trout, the venison hot dogs, the mini monte cristo sandwiches, and the french fries. \n\nThe venison hot dogs and the smoked trout were fantastic and interesting. The french fries were very well made, and the dipping sauces delicious. I was so impressed with these that I was then a bit underwhelmed by the mini monte cristos. Since everything else there seemed to have a unique spin on it, I expected them to do something original here as well, but they were just like any monte cristo you might have. They were very tasty of course, but nothing new. \n\nWith the food plus two draft beers, our total was $52.05 before tip and we were stuffed and satisfied. I applaud them!",

The waitress we had was as good as ones we've had in previous locations: super cheerful, adorable, and prompt at checking on drinks and clearing away the plates.\n\nWe went today to check out Pliny the Younger, and while the ensuing scene was a little chaotic (maybe drink tickets would have been easier?) with two lines on either side of the store, they did the best they could, letting in 10 people at a time until the restaurant was filled. We were worried about our friend, who was running late and doesn't like beer, not being allowed in, but she had no problems after letting the host know we were waiting for her.\n\nThe food was also delicious. We all shared the Asturian Blue cheese which was nicely complimented by a blackberry sauce, I had the wild mushroom sandwich which had a lovely lemony flavor, my boyfriend had the three cheese sandwich (which I have ordered before and is quite good), and our friend had the truffled egg toast, which we have also tried before and is one of the standout starter items.\n\nAll in all, I have yet to be disappointed by an experience at a Tria in either location, even with these crazy extenuating circumstances!",

I've had it in the USA & Toronto and was soo happy to learn they just opened in Edmonton! \nWent on Friday of the May long weekend and waiting time was 30mins although I was told it was 45mins to 1 hr. Make sure to go early enough as they do not take reservations.\nSeafood super super fresh. I had shrimps, dungeonese crab, mussles and oysters and corn. Oysters needed a bit of salt. We ordered mussels with garlic butter sauce but next time I'd go with everythin captain boil. \nPrice was surprisingly not as expensive as I thought it'd be.\nI recommend getting the captain's boil house flavour every time! Service was excellent! Waiters kept refilling my pop, one of the best services I've encountered so far! Keep it up Captain's Boil!\nDefinitely recommend this place!",

Way, way garlic heavy and runny, runny sauce.  Hubby had an average burger.  We both remembered it being loud, but we thought maybe still worth a second trip.\n\nTrip #2 they first tried to seat us right in front of the guitar player.  Asked to move upstairs, and still way loud.  Ordered the same fried ravioli app - way overcooked and disappointing.  This time I ordered the Shepherd's Pie, marked as one of their specialties and they are all a pub after all.  Wrong.  Big mistake.  Horrible.  Their Shepherd's Pie is a base of browned meat with something red speckled in (maybe pimentos?), with a huge slab or potatoes that were not creamy, not hot, and not flavorful.  And a HUGE slab.  Beside that there was obviously microwaved broccoli still way chunky and microwaved baby carrots... both absolutely plain except for a brown canned gravy poured over everything.  Gross.  I ate like three bites and lost my appetite and shoved aside.  When the waitress asked if I wanted a box and I said no.... you'd think she'd inquire, right?  No, she did not.\n\nHubby had a burger that was good, but in his words Five Guys a few storefronts up is better.  His steak fries were also good.\n\nWe don't drink beer, and this is clearly a sports and beer lovers place.  We tried, twice, and are done.  No, thank you.",

After ordering you grab your cups and go get your drinks. Now your adventure begins, stroll out to the back of the property and you're greeted with an awesome ocean view. As others have said there is a great big sandbox with toys for kids to play but the best part is the great ocean view and atmosphere for the adults. We had the grilled fish & shrimp tacos. They were good - everything was very fresh.  Tacos come with a large side of fresh made tortilla chips & pico de gallo. Will definitely come back and try other items.",

  "text": "We wandered into Slate because the wait for brunch at Day by Day was longer than we were willing to wait. Unfortunately, getting seated immediately at Slate does not imply that you will get your food any faster. There were two other people in the restaurant when our party of six was seated but, despite the emptiness, our food somehow took 45 minutes to make. When we asked about the status of our meal we were told that they were doing their best but to keep in mind that \"we were a six-top without a reservation...\" Personally I think that having or not having a reservation seems rather irrelevant when your restaurant has plenty of open tables...\n\nIn conclusion, I've experienced better and faster service. \n\nIf you have the time, the brunch is good (I enjoyed the frittatas and home fries/chips - although that may have been my hunger talking).",

  "text": "Love this location!! \n\nI had two brochures that needed printing, and a bunch of different pages need to be printed. They were super nice and very sweet. I just wish I could remember all their names so I could give them all KUDOS. I wrote them down on my receipt and now can't find it or the names. The manager was there and she helped the person who was trying to figure out my total (because if you have a brochure and need 100 copies that means both sides need to be printed but it means you pay for 200 copies but only obtain 100 brochures). I was glad the manager was there to help. All of the four young women who were working that day were super sweet and friendly. \n\nThe store was clean and well organized. I got 4 ear bud  be (head phones) cause they were on sale 2 for $10. Plus I got them in four separate colors.\n\nIt was Friday before Labor Day weekend. Because of the 3 day weekend there were lots of print orders. It seemed like several were frazzled. So even if they were all frazzled they were able to be professional and super sweet. They wrote up my order and gave me my total and then I paid for it. I sure how that Office Depot reads this and finds out who was working Friday and gives them all KUDOS. So sorry ladies that I forgot your names.",

Our tour guide was a woman with a huge love for NOLA and that really shone through. She wore a big billowing cape and made us feel right at home in our costumes! \n\nAlthough the tour was a cemetery tour, she took us around NOLA a little bit first so we had some context and background of the city and its architecture. Upon reaching the cemetery we saw that there were tons of other tour groups there - our guide was great at ushering us around and through the maze of narrow passageways to give us the most personal experience possible. \n\nBestie and I had an amazing time doing this tour, both being totally crazy about tours like this!

Sometimes the wait is long but not on this visit. \n\nThe only consistent disappointment is the corn bread & biscuits. I've heard others rave about them but I think they are tasteless. Cracker Barrel has done a good job of adding lower calorie choices that are quite delicious and satisfying. \n\nThey should spend time improving the cornbread and biscuits. \n\nThis visit I ordered the BBQ chicken topped with diced apples. Yum! My son got buttermilk oven fried chicken and said it was as good as deep fried. My daughter, grilled chicken tenders, her favorite. My hubby ordered grilled chicken salad and said it was wonderful. \n\nWe ended our visit with a walk through the gift shop. Always great fun!

You'll find bagels, donuts, and (MmmMmm) you'll find coffee... I'll ignore the sandwiches for now.\n\nFOOD\nWith a word like \"bagel\" in the title, I expected the bagels to blow me away. With around 20 types of bagels-- they are DELICIOUS to eat without additions or toasting, but don't expect to substitute your New York plane tickets for these. I'm a donut fan and these are a hit or miss. If it has thick frosting, the frosting BREAKS APART from the donut in chunks! Noooo! But if the frosting has been glazed on, it was done so with love and partly melts into the donut dough which makes it delicious. \n\nAh coffee--although some types are served a bit small for the price--MmmMmmm. Awesome, many choices. It complements the dough-ness of the food and comes in many forms. A side area allows for self-service. \n\nSERVICE\nThe employees run the place like a corporate business: serious, brisk, unsmiling. The quick service is awesome as well as the acknowledgement upon entry... but it doesn't seem like these guys get buddy-buddy with anybody. I'm assuming they have cult fans--I've seen ALL types of people go here. ALLLLL freakin' types. (That's a good thing)\n\nLOCATION APPEARANCE\nThe store blends into the not-so-pretty plazas of St. Pete's 4th Street. Worn out signs outside, dusty parking lot... stark contrast from the comfiness that seems to radiate nuclear energy from inside. Cool-- at the side you can watch a baker creating the pastries for the store.",

  "text": "Dined on a busy saturday evening as a dinner before a concert.  As everyone else had commented before- the first courses- foie gras soup and pork belly dishes were excellent and full of flavor.  Second courses- octopus and sea bream also met expectations and were cooked to perfection.  One entree in particular, however was especially most disappointing after having had two preceding fabulous courses. \nThe majority of the ROAST PORK entree was not edible.  Had we not been in a hurry to get to a concert I most definitely would have sent it back.  It was one rectangular supposed piece of roast pork, but as you cut into it there was no pork to be found.  Instead it was white cubes of pork fat with less than 0.5 cm of discernable pork meat.  Had the dish stated pork belly I would have had some understand, but the menu clearly stated it was a roast pork dish.  Where's the meat?  I was in disbelief that they could even serve such a dish which was 80% inedible unless you enjoy pure fat, then that's your dish.  Sadly I cannot recommend such an establishment based on this last course.",

  "text": "On 3/5 (big snow day in Nashville) a couple of friends and I went to Local Taco in Sylvan Park for dinner.  When we arrived, the place was jam packed, and we knew there would be quite the wait.  I live right by Local Taco, and frequent the place.  Food is always delicious, along with the margaritas!  The Shrimp Taco is my favorite, along with the Local BBQ (try it out!)... \n\nMy friend got her food on a separate ticket, and awhile went by, and I still had not received mine.  It took a little longer than usual, but I figured it was because they were so slammed.  A few minutes later, the girl who took my order came out and saw my number was still on the table.  She asked if I had gotten my food yet, and I said no, and she apologized and said she'd be right back.  Then Bryan Haas (I'm guessing he was the manager at the time), came out with our food, apologizing.  Long story short - I received AWESOME customer service from the Local Taco staff, and Bryan Haas especially.  They comp'd our food for the delay, and gave a gift card to return as well.    I told him the gift card wasn't necessary, but he insisted. Bryan also slipped his business card in there, which I thought was very professional and sincere.\n\n  I just wanted to give a shout out to one of my favorite restaurants and the all-star staff that works there.  Going above and beyond for your customers is what makes everyone love Local Taco so much :)  Thanks!  And see y'all soon!",

Nope he just came to the table and said oh sorry and walked away!!!!  \n\nHis name is Amonte or something like that!!! \nI don't mind paying whatever for a good meal but this is ridiculous!!!! The waitress on the hand was awesome!!!",

I bought some personal lessons on a whim for really cheap as for something to do on off nights. At the time (building has since been torn down and rebuilt) the shop was an awesome little studio right downtown and open late in the evening to work around my busy schedule. I couldnt have been more impressed with Eric's level of knowledge and the actual art of teaching students how to play the guitar.  I even continued going to see Eric after the 5 sessions were used because he made guitar learning fun!  You can probably learn how to play a guitar online, I changed an car alternator from a video on youtube, but you'll be miserable without some personal guidance from the best guitarist in town.  Eric's an absolute stud, he loves what he does and it shows. Young or old, give him a look!",

Their food is overpriced compared to other \"Healthy food\" places. Even With the sales it is sometimes not even worth it. The produce also gets old quickly and I can find the same items they carry here at publix for the same or even less. I do browse the sale options and I come sometimes for that after I compare them to other stores. \n\nThe salad bar/ prepared meals are meh. Actually disappointing. I always end up driving to Whole Foods :-/ Every time I try to do my grocery shopping here I always end up having to go to other stores to find what I need for the week. I can't say that I have been able to come here and fully shop for the week and feel like I got the best deal. \n\nThe only time I come here is for specific items like the enlightened ice creams because they carry almost all of the flavors.

  "text": "Came here to grab a couple of beers on a Thursday night.  It was surprisingly busy, given that the place just opened.  Supposedly this is a side project from the folks at Farmer's Cabinet and you can tell based on the lighting (or lack thereof).  Thank god the hostess led us up the stairs because I couldn't see a damn thing!  But enough of my whining...let's get back to the important stuff.  \n\nThere are 24 taps downstairs and then they keep the 12 local taps at the upstairs bar.  I was pleased with the Engine 1892 Market Stout from Philadelphia Brewing Company, which was a recommendation from the bartender, Rocco.  He clearly knew his beers, but was also able to recommend/successfully make some cocktails for my friends.  He was also very personable.  The food menu looked really good, but it was under the \"coming soon\" section, so I was unsure if it was actually available last night.  I was intrigued by the turnip kimchi that apparently comes on their hot dogs.  I'll definitely be back to try that and will update my Yelp review accordingly.  \n\nTo summarize, a great place for beer aficionados.  And vampires.  I'm torn between giving 3 and 4 stars, but I figure I can always go up once I try their food!",

  "text": "I hadn't really planned on stopping at Edley's because we have some pretty okay BBQ in my city and it's just not really my jam. (Hot chicken over BBQ any day of the week for me) However, we wanted a \"snack\" so we stopped in around lunchtime right before the lunch rush. We got 2 brisket tacos and the daily feature, fried green tomatoes. The food took awhile to get to us, but when it did... holy crap. It was SO GOOD! The tacos were amazing, stuffed full of juicy shredded brisket, pico de gallo, beans, fried jalapenos... maybe more stuff but they were so flavorful and amazing I could barely stand it. And the fried green tomatoes were delicious as well! It ended up being way more food than we wanted for a small snack but we ate every single bite. Well worth it! It got super busy in there and it's definitely in one of the most touristy areas but they have another location you can check out.",

This restaurant has the best authentic Mexican/Spanish food in the greater New Orleans area.  The food is cooked fresh in an open kitchen that smells so good it will have your stomach growling.  The menu used to be written in Spanish however, they switched to pictures and an English menu which has only allowed me to explore Spanish cuisine further.  My husband and I are addicted to the horchata drinks.  He loves the fajitas, I love their enchiladas.  I chose a red sauce over my enchiladas instead of green which the hostess explained the green sauce was hotter but I found the red sauce to be spicy to perfection.

It was really great that they offer you a sample of the food if you are unsure.\n\nFood:  Overall very good.  I was hoping for a bit more spice and strong flavors, but it seems like it is made marketable for the general population.  Which worked out fine with me because there were seasonings available on the counter to bump up the flavor profile.  I got the etouffee and bread pudding.  The etouffee was good, but the flavor got a little muddled after eating it for a while.  It didn't have the depth of flavor that I was hoping for.  The bread pudding was super delicious!  I would recommend it to anyone needing a sweet fix.  My friend enjoyed her jambalaya.\n\nOverall:  I would certainly come back.

We also ordered the roast beef sandwich. The french toast was delicious! It almost reminded me of the bread pudding. The only problem... it wasn't big enough!!! If I wasn't being conservative I could have eaten that portion of french toast in 2 bites. Not joking. It was good but not sure if it was worth like $7. The roast beef sandwich however was AMAZING! Boar's head never gets old. There was also some kind of chutney in the sandwich which is what made it pretty tasty in my opinion. And the sandwich was only like $6 and came with fruit. \n\nSuch a cute brunch spot. I would absolutely return!",

  "text": "This hotel is located near the Tampa International airport.  I stayed here last week and have stayed here several times over the past 8 years.  This Embassy Suites is not like most Embassy Suites as it does not have the center atrium.  The hotel is a standard high rise building.  \n\nBad - Parking at this hotel is a challenge.  They have a small garage and the parking spots are very small with extremely tight turns.  If you want to prevent getting your doors dinged, don't park in the garage.  Also, there is no elevator in the multi-story parking garage.  So plan on dragging your luggage up and down several flights of stairs. \n\nGood - As with all Embassy Suites they put out a good breakfast spread with cooked-to-order eggs, omelettes and pancakes.  Also, the employees at this hotel are very friendly.\n\nIn summary, I find the parking situation to be unacceptable and I will choose a different hotel when returning to Tampa.",

Their lasagna is supposed to be one of their famous dishes as well, but it is on the heartier side. \n\nAtmosphere is nice. We sat on a chilly night in the room with a fireplace. It was cozy. Also, great location right on the Delaware River. It seems like a more middle aged clientele, it's not really a hot, new restaurant. More of a conservative, nice, laid back place.

Being a naturopath, he is familiar with both natural and allopathic methods of treatment.  Although his staff said he was familiar with the neurological issues I was asking about, he did little to discuss them with me.  He also did not ask if I wanted a more natural or allopathic approach.  He sent me out the door with an allopathic prescription for something he could have easily addressed with a natural approach.  When I called to cancel my follow up appointment, his staff was curt and dismissive and attempted to make me feel badly about cancelling.

Being that it was just across the street from campus, it was the easiest dinner one could find if they missed dinner in the dining hall.\n\nI think I gained much of the beginning of my \"freshman 15\" because of Larry's!  Popular among many SJU students, you will find a younger crowd usually occupying the tables chowing down or waiting for their order to be done.  The cheesesteaks are big for the price that they charge and they are always stuffed!\n\nYou can't find cheesesteaks like that anywhere but Philly!",

There was a party of 2 seated just before us who managed to eat and leave before our entree even arrived! \nThe house salad is large enough for three people! I had the fried mozzarella which was quite good...as were the onion rings. I had the cheesesteak and fries. Again, not bad at all! The bacon cheeseburger was also very good. Though, the bacon is so thick you could never bite into it on the burger. The bacon of the third person with us was as black as the ace of spades!\nSo, to wrap this up, I wouldn't make a special trip again for dinner because of the slowness.

I would guess the entire oval-shaped loop would be around 3/4 of a mile - it was a lovely slow 20 minute walk. \n\nIt appeared sparsely populated but I passed two families with strollers and a group of seniors. Big parking lot, off Campbell Road on the North side of the park. A hidden gem, but if you are around and up for a quiet walk through a beautiful garden, come by! Its free!",

Our entrees were the Steak and Frites and the Braised Lamb with Fresh Herbed Pasta.  The steak was perfectly cooked and well seasoned, the fries were limp and greasy.  The herbed pasta dish was interesting but there were only two tiny pieces of lamb, must have been less than 2 oz of meat in this dish.

I began looking around at other reviews for local salons and Salon L'Etoile had gotten rave reviews about their waxing and brow shaping services. I made an appointment and was lucky enough to get one for the same day, later that afternoon with Ashley. There were two women at the front desk who greeted me as I arrived. Both ladies were very pleasant and one escorted me up to the second floor waiting room. She spoke about the other services they provide. \n\nThe waiting room is dimly lit and their is soft music playing throughout. I think they accidentally double booked Ashley, as I waited 15-20 minutes, which wasn't that big a deal (in my opinion). Ashley met me and brought me into the treatment room, where she also had music playing. She asked me what I was looking for and walked me through the process. She got to work right away and even asked if the temperature of the wax was OK. She also filled my brows in with a pencil before letting me see the finished look. I am very happy with my brows. She listened when I said I didn't want them too thin and she didn't try to change my look. I will definitely be returning in 5 weeks and will recommend to friends in the area.",

  "text": "It kills me to give only three stars,  but it's really just my fondness of days gone by that keeps me from giving only two. \n\nUpside:  They have great bar food and the best beer selection around.  It's a friendly place and the crowd is always un-stuffy and everyone is having a good time.  They've got a fantastic outdoor area, and the staff is generally pretty pleasant. \n\nThe kickers:  This was my long-time local go-to.  I used to frequent at least a couple times a week hitting happy hour during the week,  and brunch or drinks over the weekend with friends, to the point this place has been known as my \"cheers\".  However,  I'm not sure if it's new management or what,  but over the past year or two,  the service has gone down hill. WAAAAY downhill.   You'll sometimes for for 20\"+ before anyone even approaches you for an order,  and even sitting or standing at the bar,  the bartenders have become pros at standing with their back to the bar and not paying attention or getting your order for at least 5-10\".  The food is still good,  but they used to NAIL IT every time on the burger however you ordered it.  The last several times,  everyone got WELL done,  regardless of order.  \n\nI still go here,  and keep hoping every time that the service quality will return,  but unfortunately the area has exploded so it's always busy,  and I think they just no longer give a rip since they pack the place no matter how crappy service and wait times and food consistency gets. \n\nLuckily,  with the area booming,  there are several other great places now rights across the street and down just a couple blocks. \n\nSummary:  If you're lucky enough to hit this place when it's dead,  don't miss it. If it's slammed,  you're better off across the street at Beer Pale if service matters to you.",

  "text": "I've never had to write a review based on horrendous service/hospitality alone, but I've also never felt so humiliated as I did when I visited Wings Over Broadway for the first time the other night.\n\nI was really looking forward to trying this place since people rave about how good the wings are and the great Tuesday night specials. I was coming from work so I arrived a few minutes after my party. The restaurant was half-empty when I arrived and there was no one waiting in line, so I went to my friends' table where their food had just arrived. That's when I was informed by the waitress that I couldn't sit down.\n\nThe manager came over and explained the policy of \"no add-ons\" to a table, and the waitress offered me one of the (many) empty tables, where I would be \"allowed\" to sit BY MYSELF, as if I was some kind of pariah. My friends were aghast and we explained that we'd never been to Wings before, and they would never have invited me if they'd known I wouldn't be allowed to join them.\n\nI said I understood the policy for busy nights, and in the future we'd certainly abide by it, but since there was no one waiting for a table it couldn't hurt for me to sit down.\n\nThen the owner came over and very rudely said, \"Fine, you can sit down. But you have to pay full price for wings, no special for you.\" He and the manager were glaring at me, totally unsympathetic. I've never felt so insulted, and never before experienced this sort of treatment from a restaurant. It pretty much ruined my day.\n\nTo the owner of Wings: I was the nicely-dressed young lady that you turned away, and I'll be telling everyone I know how you made me feel and to avoid your establishment in the future.",

I had the oven on so as to pop it in there if it was cool- and it was, but we tried it both out of the box, and after a min on a 500 degree pizza stone. Much better off the stone, but still- nothing special at all. The skinny sticks are just pizza crust, no sauce, with cheese.. and unfortunately they came all stuck together  in a jumble. Since the crust was no great shakes, the sticks weren't any better. Food taste alone- sadly the better frozen pies can surpass these guys. Maybe with some time they can tweak what they are doing- they have great ideas going- just need to get a much better product out the door. I really, really had high hopes that they'd be great (their website sells it so well), so it was a big letdown that they were sub-average.",

  "text": "My husband and I dined here for the first time last night to celebrate his birthday. Here's the breakdown!\nAtmosphere-\nThis restaurant seems to be disjointed. I really liked the ambiance and feel in the bar area and a small seating area connecting to the main dining area. For some reason, I wasn't feeling it in the main dining area (where we sat). I guess that's the idea and maybe we should have asked to sit in a different area. Part of it may have to do with the fact that we were the youngest people in the place by about 40 years. We could hear the commotion in the kitchen, which was weird because it didn't seem like we were that close to it. Next time I would request to be seated elsewhere.\nService-\nOur waitress was alright, she just seemed a little out of place. She broke a dish on the floor, and overall was a bit sloppy. She was nice enough though, and checked on us an adequate amount. \nFood- \nI loved the fact that there was the option to order petite serving, which upon arrival to our table seemed laughable. But once I started eating, it was the perfect amount of food! I ordered the Cedar Plank Salmon and my husband ordered the Crab Cakes. My salmon was delicious and crab cakes decent. However, our sides were just OK. Also my husband's salad seemed straight out of a bag. We were pleasantly surprised at the end of the meal when our server brought us 2 mini chocolate fudge cookies. Mmmmm! The perfect end to the meal!\n\nI might try this place again for drinks/appetizers or I could see a mother's day brunch here, but overall our dining experience wasn't that memorable. Maybe we will give it another try, because I really want to like this place!",

Just the right amount of spice and the Mole was not over powering as it can be when not prepared correctly! This was only their second day of being unofficially open, I was told the Grand Opening will be in a couple of weeks, and there were lots of people offering help and assistance. Things will calm down a bit later and I would rather have lots of people asking me if I need anything than people ignoring me.\nThe inside is like entering a Art Gallery of Latin Art and even the exterior is a work of art. Best décor I have ever seen outside of Mexico and rivals the top there too!\nIt is a wonderful addition to the downtown St. Pete neighborhood and I am thrilled to see it is moving \"cool\" St. Pete further south!\n I can't wait to try other items on the menu! 5 stars from me!",

Turns out to be a large room with huge king bed on the 18th floor with a corner view. Spectacular! Everything was clean, modern and lovely, and the sheets and comforters and pillows were incredibly comfortable. Room was very quiet we heard only the slightest noise from the binging of the elevator and the slamming of doors by our neighbors.\nParking was easy, if a bit pricey, but worth the convenience. Great service on check-in from valet parking to assistance with luggage to checkin to assistance with luggage to our room. Concierge was extremely helpful arranging for a dinner reservation at short notice. \nWe did not use the bar which looked great, particularly if you are a Bourbon lover. \nLobby area is stunning, with renovated marble and a safe from its former incarnation as a bank. \nPerfect location, a block from Reading Terminal Market and access to all the attractions of center city Philadelphia.",

I went a few years ago and each stop was a bar, so we really really enjoyed ourselves ha. My second time, 2 of the 4 stops were at the circle then the WWII monument. Not that it wasn't interesting, it seemed kind disrespectful drinking at the  war monument, and when we were there it was Memorial Day weekend so all the flags were up. I felt kind of uncomfortable. I like the fact we do get to bring our own drinks and peddle and drink, wish we stopped at more bars like we did my first go around. But it's still fun! Hopefully they rethink the WWII monument, but besides that it's reasonably priced a fun afternoon. Parking wise was also different than my first time. We met at a bar instead of where they launch the handlebars. Wish they were more specific on where to park or where you can park. Some of us paid for parking and others didn't. Kind of all over the place regarding parking. But once again, very fun and I suggest trying it out!",

Fresh salads, soups sandwiches and Mac and cheese! \n\nMy shrimp and avocado salad was huge and made with lemon basil vinaigrette. The salad was fresh and the shrimp was perfectly cooked. I had to get a take home container it was so big! \n\nThe Mac and cheese was impressive. I got the 5 cheese. The béchamel was a nice creamy, consistency. The top had a nice brown crust. I especially like that it wasn't topped with bread crumbs, but instead topped with a bit of cheddar. It may not be better than my homemade Mac and cheese, but it was good!\n\nI tried my son's tomato basil soup and it was delish! What a great presentation! I think there was a little creme fraiche on top for garnish.\n\nI can't wait to come back and try more of the menu!",

The only issue I had was the guy taking my order he needs to be retrained as I asked for my sandwich and for my French Onion soup after that he told me the total without even allow me to get a drink. After giving me my total I asked for a bottle water, he seemed bothered that he had add something else to my order. The guy just seemed like he didn't want to be there, he is someone who I would want to interact with my customers. I didn't get his name but I added a picture on here",

I was very wrong. The sushi burrito is perfection. It is the perfect lunch because it's fresh and light. The serving size is plentiful and the ingredients are very fresh. \n\nIt is set up like a chipotle and you pick what ingredients you would like. I would recommend adding a topping with some crunch like wonton crisps because it really adds to the overall texture. The tuna is definitely my favorite! Overall, it's an awesome lunch spot. Highly recommend.",

  "text": "It is sad but seemingly true that this place has survived for years on the overflow traffic from some of the other places at John's Pass. Tired of the wait at Bubba Gump? Not in the mood for pizza from Delosa's? Just realized that you paid for parking and that Walt'z has closed for the day - plus your feet hurt from a day at the beach ... stop for a while at Sculley's and take what they serve you. If you can find a server, that is. \n\nActually, the service isn't that bad ... the problem is with the layout of the place. The shops here want to have an eclectic air, as though they were built from driftwood and shipping crates held together with sail cloth and rope. This is fine in fantasy, but in reality does not make it easy for the wait staff to get around easily of remain within eye sight of their tables. \n\nThe food is passable, but unexceptional. Being a stone throw away from Gulf of Mexico means that a restaurant can lean towards basic tourist fare (they likely won't know how boring it is) and get away with it. Locals tend to shy away from such places, unless they are entertaining out-of-townees who believe boat drinks and breezes are more important than fine dining.",

I saw Baklava, and was told not to purchase them by the sales associate (and I appreciate her honesty) because they were hard as a rock..  I then purchased to cakes, a Pound cake, and a peanut butter mousse cake.  Everyone was looking forward to the peanut butter cake.  EVERYONE TOOK A BITE AND SPIT IT OUT!  IT WAS STALE.  The chocolate was ok, but the mousse has a horrible RANK taste, and SMELL as well.  It tasted and smelled  like spoiled cream cheese.  It wasn't one of those things that taste like something, IT WAS SPOILED.  Even the partial peanut butter cups on the top tasted stale!!!\n\nThe pound cake was ok, nothing special..  Needless to say, the experience of tasting spoiled food makes me never to return again!",

  "text": "I typically only write reviews for excellent service and like to say I try to see the best in people. However our experience at shelter compelled me to share my experience.\n\nWe reserved an hour for bowling to celebrate a birthday.  By the time the hour was up, we had 4 people yet to finish their 10th frame.  This was perfectly fine. I walked over and asked for a 5 minute extension even offering more money for the courteous extension to finish our round.  I was then directed to the bartender who said he would do this, great!  While we waited for our match to come back online, someone came over and told my me and my fiancee to get off our seats because another group was coming. Of course we don't mind moving and sharing space once the other group gets there but there was aggression in his tone.  I assumed this man was just a sour person from the next group, but I later discovered he was actually the owner rudely telling us to move our rear ends.\n\nAfter several minutes our scores disappeared, and I went to check in on the extra time still thinking this should be a simple fix and in good spirits.  I was told by the person I originally asked that he was too busy and that I should have talked to him when it first happened (this is the same person I initially talked to who redirected me to the bartended) because our scores are gone. He then redirected me to the owner who irritably said you're scores are gone, you can buy another hour if you want.  After I began to become upset, he backtracked and then offered 5 minutes but our scores  were still gone and his tone was still \"get out of my face, I don't care\"\n\nI understand mistakes happen and that's not the reason for my negative review.  Customer service was non existent. My entire party felt like a nuisance and not a customer.  The owner should be the pinnacle for customer service, but I have little doubt he is a reason that shelter has a limited lifespan.  It's a shame because it is a beautiful bar.",

Village Whiskey has high-quality meat, great preparation, and awesome sides -- it's my favorite burger place in downtown Philly. \n\nThe aioli and fries are delicious, too. Last time I tried truffled cauliflower; I'm not usually a huge fan of picked foods, but it was fantastic! The cauliflowers and carrots were crispy, and the juice had a light but very tasty flavor. I would definitely order it again. \n\nThe one catch: it is pretty expensive. Probably place you would go to for an especially fun or nice meal, but might not be able to afford each week. \n\nThe decor is cozy and up-scale, with small round tables surrounded by tall couches to sit on. You can hang up your coat when you enter the door, and the hostess stands behind a large wooden whiskey barrel. It's a small restaurant, so it's better for dinner with a few friends or a date than large groups. The waiters are very friendly and attentive, and service is quick.

They still have Winchester making ammunition their and Olin Brass cranking out precision copper and brass alloys. unfortunately, my reason to go  there was to decommission some research equipment at the olin Brass Metals research Lab.

I've come here for lunch about a dozen times and they always push the buffet, which I understand, but they are VISIBLY annoyed when you don't want it. It's so rude! Last time I came here it was with 8 people, and the hostess asked if we were getting the buffet. I told her I didn't think any of us would, so if we could please get menus. Her face immediately changed, she said \"oh...\", and handed me 3 menus...for 8 people. When the waiter came we apologetically asked if we could have some more, and he pretty much had the same reaction! He rolled his eyes while turning to get more, and just dumped them on the table.\n\nSomething similar to this has seriously happened almost every other time! I get that the buffet is easier for them, but come on! It's not asking for anything crazy, just MENUS! At least make an effort to hide it until you get into the kitchen...",

  "text": "What a fantabulous date night with my favorite hometown chica at Il Giardino :-)  I was stoked about trying out this Italian restaurant for a while now because I had not yet been completely satisfied with my meal at any of the other Italian restaurants (chain or not) I've been to...and Il Giardino seemed like the hidden gem of Springhouse as it is tucked away in one of many shopping centers on that side of Bethlehem Pike.\n\nLike Bacco, Il Giardino specializes in pizza (actually, I have yet to try Bacco's pizza, so stay tuned!), so it was time for the ultimate test:  how does its white pizza play out?  Was I setting myself up for utter disappointment, or was I going to be enlightened?  White pizza is not exactly the most complicated-looking pizza around, but I only know of one other place that makes a few versions of it spectacularly (Top Tomato in Philly!!!).  \n\nAs serendipity would have it,  I received two pizzas on this date night: one which I had ordered (prochuitto gourmet pizza) and the other that was free (Il Giardino white gourmet pizza) because the free one was apparently sent to my table by accident -- yay!!!  It was a wonderful surprise, because the pizza was fantastic.  The white pizza that eventually came out for me was also very delicious and is definitely in my top 3.  \n\nThe atmosphere, I must add, feels intimate not just because it was small (I would say that it's 1/10 the size of The Olive Garden) but because on this Thursday date night, there were people who were enjoying themselves around their respective dinner tables like families, even if they really weren't in the same family.",

  "text": "I've been staying at this hotel for about four weeks (on work assignment in Trenton) and it's definitely one of the most modern hotels I've stayed in. The rooms are nicely appointed and the bed is amazingly comfortable. \n\nIt's a really popular spot for business travelers and it's definitely seen a lot of hard use. That's why I can't give it five stars, because their facilities people don't seem to keep the rooms in fantastic condition nor do the housekeepers do a lot of the 'little things' (like dusting/cleaning the top of the enormous shower heads or making sure all the drawers are flushed and leveled) that set other places apart.\n\nThe breakfasts are okay, for what they are... it's not the Ritz Carlton or W.A., so anyone who gripes about the food needs to lower their expectations a little. The coffee is kind of horrible but that's okay b/c there's a Starbucks in the lobby of the Courtyard across the street or one exit up in Ewing. I knew what I was getting (having stayed in other extended-stay type hotels) when I booked my stays and I was not surprised.\n\nAll in all, it's the favorite hotel of my team and we'll continue staying here when we're on assignment in Trenton.\n\nTips:\n\n-East Sushi and Palermo's Pizza are two really good delivery places nearby and the front desk folks will give you menus.\n-Metro Grill is a fairly good sit-down place nearby.\n-Masa 8 is a very good sushi joint about two exits up.\n-Mikonos (Greek) is iffy, probably should avoid it.\n-Buy your beer and wine at the liquor store one exit up (it's in the same shopping center with the Starbucks, plus there's a supermarket there too)... $6/bottle for a Sam Adams is a little steep.\n-There's also a really good Italian place in that shopping center - Piccolo Trattoria.\n-They have a huge gas grill on the patio at this hotel... another team from my company has done a lot of grilling here, so if you're going to be at the element for a while with a team, it's a great way to hang out and have dinner together.\n-If the lobby music is making you crazy, ask them to turn it down or off... especially later on in the evening if you happen to be in the lobby.",

The dumpling dough is perfectly chewy and excellent as far as thickness.  The filling I thought was a little under seasoned, but when I rolled it around in the Chili Oil, it was quite tasty.\n\nI also had the burger, which I thought was an unusual item to have on the menu for a noodle bar, but thought it would be interesting to try.  The burger is on more of a denser bread than a typical bun, and the mustard greens and acidic sauces worked great together.  The burger had a lot of Eastern flavors, but was still a burger, a well cooked one, at that.  Enjoyed a quick tasty lunch for 12 bucks.  As the temperatures rise this summer, I'll probably try the cold noodles and I think the ramen is calling for me this winter.",

A few months before the trip I knew I just had to reserve a room at Castillo Inn because last time we were very happy with the room, amenities and location. \n\nThis time you were on point Castillo Inn! I reserved the same room as last time because it was very roomy and pretty. There were four of us. The tp and towels were stocked nicely and we didn't run out of either. The wifi was free and fast. The morning breakfast treats were great. My mom loved having her coffee, pastries and fruit. The beds were very comfy. Loved being so close to everything. We didn't have to drive much since everything is a short walk away, or you can ride the trolleys or the water taxi. Had so much fun! \n\nCastillo Inn, your level of service, and the quality of your rooms are to be commended. You are reasonably priced too! Another experience made memorable. Thank you again.",

  "text": "Famoso Neapolitan Pizzeria is one of the places I go to on a regular basis for a good pizza that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.  Why is pizza so expensive in Edmonton? Is it because cheese is expensive in Canada?  As far as pizzas, I have ordered the Margherita, Abruzzo, Vesuvio, Siciliana, and Moo Shu BBQ Duck.  The pizza that I order the most often is the Abruzzo and the pizza that I found the most disappointing was the Moo Shu BBQ Duck.  The time I ordered it, I found the flavor profile of the whole okay, but the execution was poor.  The duck was overly oily and the hoisin sauce overwhelming.  The one time that we ordered the Caprese Salad, the cheese texture was soggy and lacking flavor.  We found that this preparation of the salad was inedible.  The manager came to the table to explain the \"artisan\" cheese and how it is sometimes not created in a consistent quality.  He removed the salad from our bill and kindly offered us a complimentary dessert which we declined. We made sure to give a generous tip to staff since the service was great regardless of the salad.",

  "text": "Like most people, I generally don't like running errands, especially ones that involve government services. However, this location strays far from the stereotype of rude, disgruntled post office employees, as the people who work here have always been kind and friendly to me.\n\nThey also use a numbering system to keep track of who comes in first and who needs to be served first, which helps keep things running quickly and efficiently. Last time I went in, I grabbed a number, then picked out a bubble mailer, filled it, labeled it etc., and by the time I was done, my number was called. At my old post office, you would have to get in line after you finished labeling your envelopes and whatnot, so the way they do it here saved me a good bit of time. Every time I've been here, I've been in and out within 15 minutes. \n\nI have also never seen this place super crowded, despite the numerous times I have been in, including on a Friday afternoon. I think this is because people prefer to go to other post offices so they don't have to deal with the metered street parking (although the post office was lovely that one Friday afternoon, trying to find a spot to put my car was a headache and a half).\n\nAll in all, this place is quick and efficient, the employees are nice and answer questions well, and it's my go to post office now.",

  "text": "Yats is my favorite restaurant in Indianapolis. I've been known to eat there multiple times a day. Yes, it's that good. I'm not sure if it was when I was a little kid, when my parents were progressive enough to give us a dab of hot sauce when we said a bad word when the craving for spicy dishes began. It could have been eating ridiculous amounts of wings weekly in high school, or dating someone whose father grows sick nasty chiles where this inner beast of spicy came from. Yats completes me. \n\nMy all time favorite dishes at Yats are the Spinach-Mushroom Étouffée and the Chicken Creole. I try to try everything, because with a rotating menu, there are special dishes that are prepared only once in a blue moon, such as the Thai Curry Chicken Étouffée or Chili Cheese Étouffée with Chicken instead of the staple crawfish. \n\nEvery meal at Yats comes complete with two slice of French bread with a super special butter. There are many choices in hot sauces, so pick your poison wisely. I like the Louisiana Lightning Strike and Cajun Power sauce (in the squirt bottle) to drench my Yats in the almighty power of spice.  I recommend using a heaping sprinkle on your French bread, and then putting a spoonful of your entree on top. HEAVEN!\n\nA word to the wise, the College Ave location is cash only. The staff is very helpful to get around this problem. They'll give you an IOU, but they never forget. Make sure to remember this is cash only so you don't look dumb when you come back. \n\nJoe, the owner, is always at the College Ave location. Say hi to him, and thank him for bringing these flavors and such exciting food to a city that is known for being inside a circle and having cars drive 500 miles in a circle. (Indy loves Circles, I guess)\n\nI'll see you at Yats.",

  "text": "It's located somewhat incongruously in South Philly, which is more known for Italian, Mexican, and cheesesteaks.\n\nThe gun club is divided up into two floors. The main floor contains ammo, pistols, revolvers, rifles, and shotguns of varying calibers and gauges  for either rent and/or sale. In addition they also have gun related accessories, including laser scopes, loaders and such. \n\nThe back part of the main floor has a waiting room where you can hang out until your number comes up as displayed by a digital LED sign above the door. They have some vending machines for drinks and snacks, and a TV if you want to be entertained while you wait.\n\nThe range is upstairs.You can get ear protection and safety glasses if you haven't brought them. They have instructors who will instruct and help you learn how to shoot if its your first time. I was impressed by both instructors I saw. They were pretty thorough without using a lot of jargon and they were very personable. The older instructor that I saw was really nice and very encouraging to his students.\n\nThe range itself is very clean and well maintained. Any problems with the target marker was taken care of fast. And they have employees circulating around so if there is someone who isn't acting safe, they identify and correct bad habits before anything can happen. \n\nYou can buy targets and ammo for a fairly decent price, considering its a range. They do tend to stick to Federal ammo, which isn't the cheapest. But, it also doesn't tend to jam like some of the cheaper stuff. The rates for non-members isn't too bad, though it would probably pay to become a member if you are going to go more than one or two times.\n\nMy only gripe, and its a minor one is that it gets really jammed with people on the weekends. So the earlier you go, the better.\n\nThe people that run this really make it what it is, a fun place to enjoy yourself in a clean and safe environment.",

  "text": "THE GOOD: great food for a decent price.  We got the $65 oyster platter which came with 12 huge and succulent oysters, about a dozen each of clams and mussels, 10-12 tails of jumbo shrimp, about half of a huge king crab, 2 small sauce cups of ceviche, and 3 different sauces including a malt vinegar, cocktail sauce, and a spicy mayonnaise dipping sauce, as well as multiple wedges of lemon.  The platter was huge and probably could have fed 3-4 people, though I was able to eat most of it with some help from the fiancee.  The oysters were fresh and delicious and were the star of the platter, while the crab was the not seasoned and somewhat bland compared to the rest of the platter.  Of note, I liked the shrimp as they were steamed with a spicy cajun seasoning which was a nice Louisiana touch.\n\nWe also ordered the fried oyster, bacon, romaine lettuce, and avocado salad which was decent.  The fried oysters on the salad were perfectly prepared, though the bacon was thick cut and a bit on the tough/chewy side (i prefer bacon in a salad to be crispy).\n\nTHE BAD: Service was horrible.  I think we got the worst server in the restaurant; here's the breakdown: His appearance--his long hair made me think he should have been in an 80's hair metal band instead of serving in a moderately upscale seafood restaurant.  His service--inattentive: 1. he never introduced himself before taking our order, 2. he didn't allow us to finish our order as after we ordered our oyster platter he took our menus and walked away and I had to get another waiter/server to order a salad that we wanted to come with our oyster platter, 3.  He forgot our bread, and we didn't realize we were supposed to get bread until halfway through our meal when we saw other tables getting bread, 4. We asked him for lemon with our water and he forgot after multiple queries, and we actually asked 3 different waiter/waitresses/servers for lemon and they all forgot, though our main waiter eventually remembered and brought the lemon to us in the middle of our meal.  The final straw in this terrible haystack was his apathy and rude demeanor at the end of our meal--after taking my credit card and charging for the meal, he walked by our table and threw the credit card/receipt pad so that it plopped on our table and said \"here you go\" and continued walking away like he didn't care.  Overall, it seemed like he did not really care for his job and was there just going through the motions.  I was surprised that a restaurant of Luke's stature hired a waiter like this, as with an appropriate waiter and appropriate service, this meal would have been phenomenal.  Unfortuntely, the service left us in a sour mood despite the quality of the food.  If the service would have matched the food, Luke would have deserved a 4 or 5 stars in my mind, but because of the poor service we received, I gave the restaurant 2/5 stars.",

Amazing classic cocktails - we had a Sazerac, a Ramos gin fizz, milk punch, and he had some Absinthe (not my taste).  The other bar staff all agree that Paul is very exacting about his cocktails - the right preparation, glass, garnish, presentation.  We had the Oysters Rockefeller for a snack, really delicious - four perfectly fried oysters on a dish of spinach with cheese, served with fresh bread.

  "text": "Love the fact that you can access this place through the mall and it's garage. The interior looks more or less like an old library... takes us old folks back to our college days... nicely done... floating bookshelf over the bar... \n\nI wasn't overly impressed with the cocktail choices, I've been so spoiled lately from the vast collection of craft cocktails around town, so I just stuck to water. \n\nAs I generally do drag my meet-up group with me, we had a table of 14 and this poor kid had to take care of all of us by himself. He got a little help when the main dishes came out, but other than that he was on his own. They even seated another table in his section. They knew we were coming, so I would say understaffed. Our waiter tried his hardest and he ran all night, but service could have been better had he gotten a bit more help or at least not be seated more tables. \n\nAnyway, let's get to the food. We often share dishes, so I had quite a few samples and here is my verdict:\n\nBeer cheese tater tots: absolutely delicious, big portion, must have for any tater, cheese and/or bacon fan.. it hits all those areas.\n\nFried cauliflower: fantastic dish, also quite a portion, delicately breaded cauliflower fried to a crisp, tender but not mushy inside and served with an interesting ranch sauce.\n\nFried avocado: I was suspicious I must admit, but it turned out nice... not as big a portion as the other dishes, but nicely done. Coated avocados, deep fried, nice outer crunch, creamy middle, served with a grilled lime and a special ranch sauce... trickle some lime juice on the avocado and dip it in the ranch... omg good.\n\nShishito peppers: guess that's the new fad...basically roasted peppers... not as exciting as it may sound. The little sesame dip that came with it brought  most of the flavor for this dish. Lots of peppers though. \n\nChilaquilles: seemed to be a nacho type creation with lots of chicken and cheese. Not bad, but I wouldn't go out of my for this dish, somewhat bland. big portion though.\n\nFrench Fries: not worth it\n\nTater Tots: absolutely delicious\n\nOnion rings: meh\n\nCucumber tomato salad: wonderful, large portion, nice vinaigrette, not overpowering, wonderfully light fresh salad. highly recommend giving it a try. \n\nMac and cheese: good stuff\n\nDoctorate burger: overrated and deemed not worthy of the price tag.\n\nDouble Major: good, but in my opinion was overdone and a bit dry.\n\nFrench burger: a very drippy cheesy affair, nicely done though.\n\nOverall I would say it's an ok burger spot. On the pricey side, but good for an occasional outing. I probably would just eat all the apps and sides because they were well worth it.",

  "text": "The Blind Tiger is tucked in near some antique shops in Ybor City, unassuming to the eye walking by it save its awesome sign (of a blind tiger, of course) painted on the window. The interior is warm and inviting and the focus is on coffee, tea, and fresh baked goods with some clothing and homewares also for sale. What really impressed me however was that there is as much emphasis on the tea as the coffee: too often at coffeehouses tea is simply an afterthought and nothing more. Not here. There are about six selections of tea and they roughly cover the gamut of black, oolong, and green teas you'd hope to find. The coffee I had was very good and the baked goods include such favorites as banana bread, cakes, and cinnamon rolls--the latter apparently being what Blind Tiger is most known for locally. \n\nOverall it's a very neat little place and the interior is one which makes you feel no expense was spared to create a haven from the loudness and bustle of Ybor City, where it seems every other business is a bar or club. As much as I love bars, it's great to have a place that provides a degree of quiet and serenity.",

  "text": "A tour guide perfectly described the difference between Bourbon Street and Frenchman Street. Bourbon Street is for drunks, drag queens, and prostitutes. Frenchman Street is where the music is. I highly recommend Three Muses, which is a gastropub on the street. The food is incredible. The mac and cheese is amazing. The cheese it uses is great and the dish comes out sizzling hot. Once I started eating it, I could not stop till I finished it. I have the dish ranked as good as any mac and cheese I have tried. It is in a tie with Beechers (locations in New York and Seattle). The pork belly and \"Banh mi\" Gulf Fish Tacos are excellent. The lamb sliders and sweet potato gnocchi with Louisiana crab are very good too.\n\nOf course, Three Muses also has live jazz performances. The music is fantastic. I arrived at the gastropub ten minutes before it opened so I could get a seat at the bar immediately. It was a Sunday night and it still got busy for dinner in a hurry.\n\nIf you are visiting New Orleans and looking for recommendations, feel free to message me through Yelp and I can share my itinerary, which includes my Yelp reviews. The information for an electronic copy can also be found via my Yelp profile.",

Not sure if they are trying to save pennies or there was a change in management.",

Not very Greek, I know. But seriously, these are no McCain potato sticks. They're close to the best I've ever had. You can also get a mean fried calamari plate here. Who knew?! \n\nI don't think the one on Whyte even serves appies like that. This franchise is run by Francis, a super sweet lady who takes pride in keeping a very clean restaurant. It has more the feel of an intimate little restaurant than a fast food chain. When I feel like Opa! I head to WEM. Their pita bread is so yummy and fresh and their tzatziki is to die for.",

No problem. The place was not crowded when we arrived and we were promptly seated. When we left the place was full. I would suggest making reservations as I imagine on the weekend it is packed.\n\nOur waiter was very professional and helpful with recommendations. Our first wine selection couldn't be located but the recommended substitute was excellent.\n\nThe fresh, warm bread we started out with was very good. We shared the toasted raviolis and the mushrooms with polenta. Both were excellent. I would say these are some of the best toasted raviolis around.  It's very easy to tell they were never frozen. I ordered the \"Hay and Straw\" and loved it. I even had leftovers which is a rare event. The other two dining partners loved their meals as well.\n\nI will come back here again when looking for a great Italian meal in a classy setting.",

Service was awesome for a working lunch. We never went without but there weren't a ton of interruptions.\n\nI got one of their specials, the bacon turkey burger and fries. The burger was good sized for a lunch portion. After eating it, I was full but not stuffed. The burger itself was well seasoned. The turkey was light but hearty enough. The bacon was mostly good but part of it was not as crispy as I like it. It comes with all the fixings. I got fries as my side. They were perfectly cooked. Very crispy outside but not burnt. They were salty with a lot of flavor. I just wish there was a little more of them. \n\nIt was a great lunch all around.",

  "text": "Can I first confess that while I'm a Top Chef fan, I'm mistakenly thought Kevin Gillespie was Kevin Sbraga? Imagine my surprise when I sat down to my New Year's Eve meal and I saw a brown bear instead of a ginger bear.\n\nI've been excited to know a Top Chef winner has opened up a restaurant a few blocks down my place but I haven't gone for months because I felt somewhat intimidated. The price is of course a little higher and I've always had a distaste for restaurant that only offers taste and not fulfillment. So when it was a few days before X'mas and the few restaurant newsletter ever so \"gently\" reminded me that the New Year's Eve dinner is actually a big deal, I started soul searching for a restaurant that I always wanted to try but haven't had a chance to do so, my mind landed on Sbraga.\n\nThe place has the very same decor that the hipper restaurants in Philly and New York favors, walls lined with wood planks, the very urban wood cabin feel. Silver and black balloons filled up the ceiling for NYE, the place was packed with people. \n\nOn New Year's Eve, they offered a 4-course champagne menu. While it is nice, it's 3-times more expensive with no selection whatsoever and I'm a light-weight drinker, and it was early and I like to choose, so we opted for the regular four-course menu.\n\nI indulged in the rich and surprisingly sweet Foie Gras Soup. It's velvety, almost like a sabayon. For the second course, I had the Sea Bream which I recommend the dish wholeheartedly. The Sea Bream has a really crispy skin, the fish is well cooked. The same can be said about the piece of pork belly in the dish. I also love the squid ink sauce and the calamari \"noodles\". Love it. would eat it again, would even try to make it in my own kitchen. For the third course, I had the fettucine with the perfectly cooked 62 degrees egg. the egg is indeed perfectly cooked, but it's not much different from a pasta carbonara. Maybe even less, since the amount of pasta is little and the dish is recommended to be mixed up, the pasta to egg sauce ratio is a little out of whack. The whole dish is a little more \"decomposed\" than I like it to be. The churro/coffee creme brulee is a nice finish to the meal. \n\nI wish that the whole meal is more filling, but at the end it wasn't too bad. Me and my friend was debating whether we wanted a sandwich after the meal, but it was fine. Service was good, our server is charming even though he spilled some water. I had a Sbraga Punch which to me tasted very much like cough syrup and he had no problem switching it to the Bell Hop for me which was quite unique and pleasant. Being sat right next to the kitchen also has its perks, other than being right in Sbraga's face, occasionally you'll hear they yell \"Service!\" which it's almost like they're putting on a show for you before you hear it enough and you wonder whether they are having problems with their wait staff. The couple next to us were obviously not a Top Chef fan, since their waitress told them that she'll \"relay their compliments to Kevin\" and they were murmuring to themselves that they had no idea who Kevin was.\n\nWill I go back? I would probably, if a friend hasn't been and suggest to go. Personally, I still like to have a meal that fills me up, especially if I have to pay almost $100 per person.",

So to take advantage of free alcohol you generally have to show up pretty early. It's a cash only bar, but they do have an ATM in the back next to the photo-booth. Camel Girls frequent this place so if you're a smoker, look for them.\n\nThey have karaoke on Sundays, I've never been there when it's super crowded so if you like karaoke it's a good spot to be.\n\nNo complaints, always fun!",

  "text": "I've been here a handful of times, and bagels have always been delicious. I visited the shop on 5/19/18, and this will be my last visit. I went there because I was hungry and in need of food, but it seemed like I walked into the middle of classic P.T. Barnum show: clowns juggling while riding unicycles and elephants parading around on their hind legs. The first employee I interacted with, at the \"bulk\" bagel counter, didn't hesitate to let me know that I was attempting to order from the wrong location. Fair enough. They did have a sign on the counter, but it wasn't as conspicuous as an \"order here\" sign that dangles from the ceiling. Her tone made it clear to me that I had already committed one transgression. I then order from the attendant at the POS. I clarified my complicated order of a breakfast sandwich and two toasted everything bagels with a tomato and garlic cream cheese, three times. The first clarification was that I wanted everything bagels, not plain. The second  clarification was directed toward me because they actually have garlic and herb cream cheese, not garlic cream cheese. The third was my reiteration of the tomato and the quantity of the said bagels. At this point I had more confidence in a drunk ESL Uber driver getting me home safely than my order being prepared as per my request. After waiting for my extravagant order to be prepared to imperfection and gazing at the yellow ceiling grid with stalactites of black dust, my name was called and the first employee I interacted with hastily handed me my bagel bag. On the ride home I asked my partner in crime to ensure that there were 3 bagels in the bag because they probably \"F-ed\" the order up. He assured me that the quantity was correct. When I got home, I feverishly ripped open the wrapping on the two everything bagels, like a joyous child on Christmas Day, only to find     that the bagels had the tomatoes omitted and the cream cheese barely exceeded a skim coat. The breakfast sandwich was anemic at best with barely any protein on it. I am so glad that I expected disappointment. Honestly I'm not too upset because closer to my house there is a new bagel shop: Red House bagels, where the staff is courteous, the shop is cleaner, and the bagels a bit larger. Red House is my new bagel stop.  Sorry Newtown Bagel Co, you've been replaced. Although your actual bagels are slightly better tasting, it is not enough to reconcile the pain points associated with your operations. My words of advice, replace (don't clean) your ceiling tiles and clean the filth from the grid. Having almost 10 years of food and beverage experience, I would hate to see what your walk-in and floors behind the counter look like. Coach your employees on courteous service, or maybe treat them better and they might pass that on to your patrons. Oh and maybe write the orders down before entering them into the POS, because sometimes those machines aren't as navigable for some operators. I'd like to keep going on about this, but I am probably beating an already abused P.T. Barnum animal.",

  "text": "Back when this place opened about 20 years ago, it was a great place to eat and I have been going there for many, many years.  Back then, I would have rated it 5 stars.  I've dined there recently (was craving a steak and was too far out from going to my usual favorite steakhouse which is located in another county).  It was a Friday night about 8pm and I was expecting to have to wait to be seated.  We were seated right away.  The restaurant was busy, but should have been packed for a Friday. This shows how the place has gone somewhat downhill over the years and more people are going to places like the Texas Roadhouse and Long Horn Ranch or Outback.  I ordered the delmonico steak (my favorite cut).  I ordered it medium rare and it was cooked more like medium.  But I didn't complain.  At least it was still pink inside because I can not stand a steak that is too well done.  My meal came with two sides and all I really wanted was a baked sweet potato.  I declined the other side.  Our server was overly pushy about me ordering something else to go with it because \"I was going to have to pay for it anyway\".  I found her pushiness and comments to be a little rude but I let it slide.  My fiance ordered one of the specials, which included a filet mignon with a shrimp kabob.  The menu showed the picture featuring the kabob with chicken, shrimp and red peppers on the skewer.  When the order came, needless to say, it looked nothing like the mouth-watering picture featured on the menu.  There were five small shrimp (dried out looking) on the skewer and that was it.  When our server came by to ask how everything was, we gave the standard nod and then my fiance asked about the skewer of shrimp.  She stated \"Oh, well that's the way we make them here\"....and that was it.  That was the LAST time she came to check on us except when it was time to get the check.  And BEFORE she handed us the check, she was very pushy about us ordering dessert.  We explained we were too full and that we would just take the check.  She continued to push until we finally said \"no, we really have to leave now\".  \n\nMy theory is that getting customers in to eat at Lone Star is not to issue, evidently RETAINING them is.  I guess they have to try and sell you as much as possible while you're there because odds are you will not be back again when there are so many other (better) choices around.",

Apparently not!\n\nI've been coming here longer than any other liquor store in the area, believe it or not from the check ins! Prior to becoming nutty about the suds, I was in love with New Jersey wines. Wine Works was my standard spot for Valenzano, Heritage, Sharrott, etc.\n\nI stopped in yesterday afternoon since it was right on my way home from the shore area. All the usual vino suspects are still well-stocked on the shelves, but I headed straight for the beer.\n\nFirst off: Check the dates. Some of the beers are dusty, and that's a bit disconcerting depending on the style.\n\nSecond: Make your own six-pack. I do this whenever possible in general, and they do have a nice selection here. Much larger than Wegmans, smaller than Total Wine, and maybe on par with Canal's, depending on the location.\n\nAlso check out their large format bottles. I was surprised to find Transmitter Brewing in stock. Transmitter is a tiny brewery on Long Island City. Like, super tiny. Like, only a few people can comfortably fit in their tasting area at a time. Definitely try their stuff if you see it and like your beer on the funky side.\n\nCheck out is always efficient. Obviously be prepared to present your ID if you're anything like me and could pass for a 19-year-old.\n\nProbably the best part of Wine Works? Very reasonable prices. My 6-pack of pretty good stuff came out to $14...aka the price I've paid for one beer on draft on a few occasions.",

The waterfall that greets you as you walk into the courtyard is a nice touch. We cam back the next day, had some drinks (full bar there folks) and although they serve sandwiches and light snacks, we tried some beignets. They were excellent. Never had better. \nIt's a quaint little outdoor area that can't be missed. Either soaking up some sun during the day, or sitting back and relaxing while enjoying the live at night.",

Friendly service, large portions and speed of food service is consistent from when I was here a few years ago. We all enjoyed our meals and didn't feel rushed to leave our table.\n\nHowever the years seem to have caught up to the place. Floor is noticeably worn down where the chairs are sliding back and forth at the tables. Bathroom was tidy but nothing exceptional by any means. Definitely want to watch that slightly raised floor going out of the bathrooms or that could be a tripping hazard. Everything is decently clean within the restaurant but this would only be a casual lunch place for me in the future.",

It has to with the shady business practices of this establishment. We come to this restaurant on a regular basis. My issue is, lately every time we come here they try to price gouge us. Most times when I order a certain menu item, they charge me the lunch price because I order a smaller portion. Depending on the day and the server, the price changes every time. Most recently I ordered only a child's cheese quesadilla, nothing else. I was charged full price for an entire kids meal. I was told when I questioned it that the \"manager\" made him charge me that way. Also on a separate occasion we were way overcharged for margaritas. This issue is now happening so frequently, that I refuse to return. Great job management, trying to get a couple more bucks just lost you loyal customers that frequent your establishment and also recommended it to friends. No more!",

I emailed for an appointment and was called immediately the following morning by the receptionist.  She was very polite and addressed all my questions and  booked an appointment with the vet Dr. Justin Keaner. \n\nUpon entering the office had a very modern tranquil setting. Clean with a relaxing zen-type esthetic. Instantly felt comfortable and was greeted by the super friend staff/ client reps Rachel and Jessica. \n\nMy puppy and I were brought into one of the exam rooms and met with the vet tech named Stephanie. The room was immaculately clean and she was very informative and helpful recording my puppy's data. \n\nLastly, I the vet Dr. Justin Keaner met with us. He was very soft spoken and you could tell he loves animals. He evaluated my puppy and explained some of the virus/ diseases that I was unaware of in this locale. He showed me an option called a \"puppy plan\" whilst even thought my dog had her first series of shots they still saved me about $100. I didn't feel like I was being \"up sold\" because if they wanted to make more money would have a la carte the visit/ shots instead of offering the less expensive bundle. \n\nGreat experience!

Their new location at Camino Real marketplace is great too,  although the older one at Old Town was more classic.  \n\nThe reason I gave 3 stars instead of a 4.5 or 5 was because of a few ridiculous rules they have.  First,  they regularly email discount coupons but want them to be printed in order to avail the discounts.  I find this very silly.  The name of the restaurant is Natural Cafe and they have messages all over the place to protect the environment.  But it's strange that they need a paper printout and don't allow if we show them the email in the phone. \n\nSecond,  they are also very strict with timings.  If you come around the closing time (9 PM), they just keep showing at the table to get you out.  The older place at Old Town was more relaxed with the timings. \n\nI would have given a higher rating of not for these absurd rules.  The food here is still one of the best.",

  "text": "We stayed a night for a \"special occasion\" over the weekend. We were able to walk from our canal-side apt, mostly because we didn't want to pay the $28 garage fee. There are plenty of valets out front, someone to open the doors for you and any check in agents not busy at their station wait in front of the counter to greet you and bring you to their station.  Check in was easy and quick and the agent was very kind. After answering all my questions about check out times, restaurant hours, and fitness center and pool locations, she took me directly to the elevators. She proudly stated that there were 2 sets of elevators, with the high rise lifts being the \"fastest in the midwest\".  Between the concierge and elevators is the Lobby Lounge with a couple tall fire n ice type fireplaces and lots of comfy looking couches, tables, and bar tables. The lounge menu looks interesting and they even have a Soju cocktail! (that's a Korean rice liquor drink.) Specialty cocktails are $9.\nWe had requested a high level room and we got the 28th (out of 33) floor with a big picture window view over the end of the canal and the White River. We had a standard double bed with oh so comfy bed linens, a work desk with a cordless phone, flat screen Samsung TV and coffee maker. The shower had a large glass door and a rain type shower head as well as 2 smaller adjustable heads below it. Fun but you can't turn all the heads on at the same time.  We were very nicely greeted with a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries after we returned from dinner, which we finished off in our bathrobes.  There is an iPod docking stereo which we couldn't get to work, but we could hear directly from the iPhone pretty well anyway. \nThe hotel and rooms are clean with a Vegas like feel. We looked around the fitness center, which is quite large and has lots of machine and small semiprivate areas for yoga/pilates/bosu. The indoor pool looked pretty small. Our room came with free breakfast at Osteria Pronto which has a sizable buffet for only $16. It would be a very nice stay in Indy for out of towners and I'd return to the bar and restaurant as a local.  I actually like the look of the building and think it makes downtown look more modern. Great location close to museums, connected to the convention center, and close to the mall and canal.",

This particular Olive Garden is in a great location and is always busy.  However, even though it is always busy the service, and drinks are always on point.  My girls and I love to go there for their amazing sangrias.  The food is just like all the others... yummy and fast.",

  "text": "My first visit to Calypso a few weeks ago after hearing about it from a friend.  A co-worker and I decided to try the Friday buffet which is seafood centric.   We had the arroz con pollo and shredded brisket; they were both full of flavor.  The brisket is best when dipped in the Guasacaca (avocado based salsa) which lends a brightness to the rich brisket.   After, we tried the seafood paella which was full of seafood and sausage.    Everything was tasty, though the buffet suffers some due to the lack of traffic as the temperature on some dishes wasn't ideal.  This is anecdotal, but deserves mentioning.  \n\nWe did speak with the owner after eating and he shared his background.  He couldn't have been nicer, and did allow us to try a few items off the day's menu (the empandas are not to be missed).   Calypso is a great addition to River Ridge, but helps fill the hole of Latin cuisine in the entire metro area.  I can't wait to get back and try more of the menu!\n\nETA: I went back for lunch today and everything was hot and fresh.  I'm guessing my previous concern has been addressed.  Food was excellent again.",

  "text": "Meeting a friend's significant other for the first time can be a very traumitizing experience.  You want it to go perfectly.  You want them to love you and think you're funny and nice and will want to continue to have you around.  Especially when its your best friend from college, and its her husband of 8 months. \n\nNow before you all go thinking \"man Michelle's a bad friend!\"  I have met him twice... for a total of 5 minutes... once drunk at a tailgate and then in the recieving line at the wedding.  Its just that every time i came to visit them, he had other stuff going on so i never got to hang out.  But this time, I was hanging out with him and was determined to make a good impression.  \n\nThe only problem... my friend knows WAY too much about me :)  And knew that when she said, \"I'll get a drink if you have one\", i would get the sangria.  Which was delicious!   Different, but highly delicious...as was her mai tai.   Then was the pressure to order the \"Bloomin Onion\".  Which is awesome, but greasy and gross, but still amazing.  But not something i want this guy i've never met to see me chow down on!  \n\nAnd rather than ordering a steak, which i really was not in the mood for, i opted for the \"Bloomin Burger\".  MORE BLOOMIN ONIONS!   The burger was thick and juicy and perfectly cooked.  It was topped with cheese and bloomin onions!  Very good.   It came with fries, but i was so full i couldn't even finish them.  \n\nWe almost ordered the \"chocolate thunder from down under\" for desert, but i think my friends husband was concerned about his own chocolate thunder from down under!  \n\nThe food was good and we called ahead and got on the waiting list to be seated at 715, yet we were seated at 6:50, so that was nice.  I felt like i was going to explode when i left.   And while it may not have been the best first impression food, it was definitely an authentic Michelle meal.",

  "text": "Food is great, drinks are great, deals are great (Brunch with 2-4-1 drinks? Heck yeah!). The menu is extensive and interesting, with unique twists on classic dishes. The service is also great, but I am withholding a fifth star due to the management's seating policies.\n\nWe came for brunch on a Sunday expecting an hour plus wait, so when the hostess informed us it would be 1hr45m we weren't surprised. However, we became frustrated when we noticed there were 4 open tables on the patio that still hadn't been seated after an hour of waiting. It was a beautiful day so we asked the hostess about it and she said that the tables were reserved. When we asked again, she explained that the patio tables were not assigned to a specific server but were instead added on to a server's load inside, so they weren't seating them because they didn't want to overwhelm the servers. Totally understandable to not want to overwork your servers, but why not seat people with the caveat that service will be slower? Or better yet, why not specifically assign a server to the outdoor section so that wait times will be lower? Having worked in the service industry, our group was confused by this. We ended up just sitting at one of the empty patio tables until the hostess notified us that a table was ready. \n\nWe ordered the Cheddar Biscuit, the Wood Fire Double Yokes, and a Turkey Feta Omelette from the specials board and all were delicious. The biscuit comes in a trio and though it doesn't look like a lot of food they are VERY filling. Our server surprised us with a side of White Trash Hash on the house because our food was taking longer than expected (we didn't even notice the timing, so it was a very nice gesture). The White Trash Hash is a must, this stuff is addicting! Potatoes, rice, and gooey cheese- who could ask for more.\n\nOverall, great place for brunch in Nashville. Expect a long line but food worth the wait. Hopefully management can improve their seating policies to cut down on wait times in the future.",

  "text": "My wife and I came here for dessert on a busy Friday night. Frost has a really big selection of Gelato flavors - maybe 20 or so - and an assortment of sorbets. My wife settled on pistachio and amaretto. Both were really good, but I think the pistachio was a bit better. \n\nWhile the flavors of gelato were quite good, I have to agree with Brenner T.'s review that says that Allegro is a better quality product than Frost. If you compare the gelato here to the same flavor at Allegro, it will lose. But Frost's strength is the variety - many more flavors than Allegro. And the gelato here is still quite good - a solid 4 stars. But I wouldn't take an Italian here looking for authentic stracciatella gelato. \n\nFrost also benefits from its location - next door to two very popular restaurants - Sauce Pizza and Wine, and Wildflower. It's a great spot for some light dessert after a meal.",

  "text": "I came to Philly for a weekend trip with my bf, and remembered how great Marrakesh was from years ago with my parents.  It's still down a dark alley off of South Street and in a house (the owners' house) Things have slightly changed- Marrakesh is still dim, and served as a 5-course eat-with-your-hands dinner family style, (as if in Morocco)  surrounded by tons of Middle Eastern decor- runs, lamps, the works. The servers are the owners- a couple who loves to keep it traditional. \n\nI called ahead for seating at 8pm but it seems as though we could have just walked in- we ate upstairs.  You have to ring the bell to get in. We came on Sunday but it was relatively busy- downstairs was full but upstairs not so much. Maybe it was because we were upstairs...but I felt service lacked a bit (we had to ask for water a few times, etc but I couldn't hold it against the one server- the wife). On Fri and Sat, there are belly dancers. \n\nIf you're new to this kind of thing, they do a good job explaining the process. First, they ran your hands through soapy water from their majestic-looking teapot. Next, they explain the menu and ask you to choose between 1 or 2 course for dishes 3 and 4. You don't have a lot of flexibility.. so I am not sure how vegetarians would fare. \n\nWe ate:\n\n1) Course 1- three salads: picked carrots, cucumbers and an eggplant puree- like a babaganoush. This was very tender, salty and good- the others were not as fancy but very tasty. A large tangine looking thing comes around for you to grab pita. The pita is ok- it's not warm, it's not fluffy but you can't win them all (and it's important not to fill up too much on this)\n\n2) Course 2- Very interesting kind of Moroccan...quiche? It's basically a flaky pastry topped with confectioner's sugar that houses egg, chicken, nuts...and some other things. It was overwhelmingly eggy, but tasty. Not my favorite dish but had to give it points for creativity and uniqueness.  The flaky dough was delish- very similar to that of the Green Spinach Pie.\n\n3) Course 3- was our choice between two chicken (chicken with lemon olive oil or spicy cumin)- of course we did spicy cumin! It was fall right off the bone- so tender as I'm sure it was slow cooked for hours. It's also half a chicken so you get the breast, thigh and wing. The sauce was not too spicy, I thought, but the cumin flavor is smoky and present. The sauce is pretty slathered across the meat- and yes you can refill up on pita if you're not into eating meat solo. \n\n4) Course 4- is a choice between beef or lamb and since I don't do red meat, I passed on this. My bf ordered the lamb though and said it was very tender and yummy- and sweet. It was topped with almonds and something else that made it sweet. \n\n5) Course 5- Dessert!  You get fresh fruit and baklava (one piece each). Usually I think baklava is too sweet for me but this one was pretty good- and not too oily. I mean, yes, it was very oily but it wasn't like...drenched in oil. It was pretty flat, cripsy and full of that nutty goodness that you make baklava. Bf said it wasn't nutty enough for him. Again, the flaky dough wins. \n\nThe fresh fruit was also a plus- except our apple was bruised so we didn't eat that. We took our orange for breakfast the next day. There were two strawberries (not really regional, ha) and giant seedless grapes that were almost frozen because it the fruit platter came with a chunk of ice. This was almost like a cornucopia..they really do make you feel like emperor and empress haha!\n\nThe meal is well paced (slow) so you have time to breathe.  They sell only a few house wines by the glass; otherwise you get it by the bottle (there are a few varieties at $30 ish, as well as liquor and the like). My bf got two glasses of red wine- the burgandy. It was actually fruity and full of body, which was a plus. I ordered the traditional rose drink which I actually wouldn't recommend- it was really, really sweet. It was like rose syrup (sweet enough), with sugar and water..it was too sweet and at $5, I was upset I couldn't finish it. \n\nThis place accepts cash only and is $25 per person. I feel the menu could get old since you don't have variety but it's definitely a must-try while in Philly.",

The lunch menu, a mere two pages, seemed a bit limited. I ordered a meatball ricotta sandwich with salad, while my dad had a chicken Parmesan sandwich with homemade Parmesan fried potato chips. The salad was very fresh, with nice greens and homemade dressing. The potatoes, not quite as crisp as ordinary potato chips, were quite good. The meatballs were well above average, nicely seasoned and with generous but not overwhelming cheese. The chicken Parm looked rather flat, and my Dad did not finish it, proclaiming it \"not for me.\" We finished up with Spumoni, very prettily presented with slivered almonds and a light drizzle of strawberry sauce.

  "text": "My expectations were fairly high for this place and ultimately I left somewhat disappointed (and $200 less in my wallet). What you are really paying for is the view here. While we didn't lay down a $200 deposit to guarantee a window seat, we did get one. I think this was because we ate so early on a Sat evening (5:30pm reservations). We were seated on the West side and the sun was setting. Fortunately I had my sunglasses with me although they did offer to pull down the shades for me as well. The views were definitely lovely but it likely would have been better had we gone later in the evening when the lights of the city were coming alive. \n\nService was excellent throughout the entire meal. Our waitress took good care of my wife who is gluten free. We asked her what a few of the roads/bridges were that we were looking at, but she sort of guessed at it. You would thinking working there they would be required to know the more major landmarks out there. Oh well.\n\nAs for the food, that's what left me disappointed. I started with the Steakhouse Salad. I guess I just assumed there would be some meat in it, but sadly, there was none to be found. There were quite a few olives in there and unfortunately I'm not an olive fan, so ultimately I wasn't able to finish the salad. My wife's roasted shrimp though wasn't bad. For our entrees, she went with the Salmon while I had the Filet and Shortrib Duo. In the end, it was pretty good but it certainly didn't wow me or anything. I've had better meals and other restaurants in the city. At least the evening ended on a more positive note with dessert. My Lemon Tart was delicious and you can tell they have a pastry chef on site. Not many gluten free options for my wife, so she just had sorbet.",

  "text": "Great family owned restaurant with fantastic mexican food and BYO (T).  Medium sized restaurant with two separate dining areas, good for large groups as you can reserve the entire back room.\n\nThe service is fantastic, even when we've shown up 20 minutes prior to closing time, the wait staff was still incredibly hospitable.  The margaritas they mix are great, which is saying something as I typically don't enjoy margaritas.  The food is delicious, and parking is very easy in the area.  If you find yourself in Northern Liberties, give it a try!  They frequently run specials on Groupon and Living Social, so keep your eyes open and save a few bucks!",

  "text": "I Love Gia's pizza and will officially say that I am addicted! The sweet red sauce that is on their pizza, the huge salad with the pepperoni, bacon, green peppers, red onions, mushrooms, and croutons, and the stuffed bread breadsticks are my faves. I actually have replicated the salad and sauce at home and am going to make the bread sticks some day. I just can't afford to eat there every week like I would like to! \n\nGia's is good at any time, but I love lunch in the early summer or late fall so I can sit outside and enjoy the weather and their lunch specials. \n\nIt's also a good place to watch games since they have lots of TV's. Not really good for groups of more than 6 or 8 due to the size. \n\nFor those of you who ate here when it was Papa Vito's, don't worry the menu hasn't changed. Also, for those of you who've tried Papa Vito's in Belleville since they opened, stick with Gia's Pizza. Easier to get to as far as parking and the one-way streets in Belleville, Gia's puts enough sauce on the pizza whereas Papa Vito's Belleville skimped on it, Gia's smells nicer and it's easier to get into the building carrying a baby at Gia's. (Guess I need to review Papa Vito's in Belleville next)\n\nThe only reasons I am giving them four stars and not five is because I can only rate the pizza, bread sticks and salad since that's all I ever get there.",

  "text": "We boarded the Carnival dream in New Orleans. If everything works out good we're going to Belize, Mexico and Honduras. We booked the trip about a month ago and this is her first time at sea during the Christmas holiday.\n\nSunday, Day 1 - Our room was a mess! The windows were so dirty my wife decided to clean them off herself. The chairs were covered in salt and when you sat on them the salt transferred on to your clothing. Then after walking in and out of the room we noticed that salt and dirt was tracking in to the room. We finally called  down to the front desk and they sent someone up to clean it off. We hold gold cards so that means we sailed at least 25 days but less then 75 and never have I've seen such a dirty ship. Dinner was OK, we are in the cafeteria not the dining room. The kids had pizza and I had chicken, again dinner was OK. \n\nMonday, Day 2 - The weather was nice so we played in the pool, kicked back in the Adult only area and I drank as much as possible. A big BBQ lunch out on the lanai deck with Ocean views! Dinner was an absolute disaster. It was formal night and it took us over an hour to get our food. There was six of us at the table and our ribs were cold and the corn was burnt. The pasta was not very good,how do you screw up pasta. Just about everything felt and tasted like it's been sitting for a long time. We complained but zero customer service!! The comedy club was awesome. Also, midnight room service was good. BLT's and cookies!! \n\nTuesday, Day 3 - another day at sea where we did the same thing we did the day before. The BBQ again was awesome. Pools were fun and we played cards inside and listen to all the trivia games because it got a little windy outside. I was hoping to avoid any negativity today but I have to tell you breakfast absolutely sucked. The eggs were very runny, the French toast was BAD and the eggs Benedict was not very good. Other then that it was a fun day at see. We ended the night at the comedy club and it was so much fun!\n\nWednesday, Day 4 - we arrive at an island off the coast of Hunderus and it was beautiful. The town where the ship parks is very pretty from the ship, however, you soon find out that the area they drop you in is owned by Carnival. Everything is for rent, everything is for sale and everything to me feels FAKE! The sand, the trees, the buildings and even the food. My kid said that the french fries were the same as the ones on the ship. So here is what you do!! Get a cab to the West end of the island. You will see most of the island driving there. The best snorkeling is on the West end and there is plenty to see and do. We got back on the boat, took lots of pictures and had dinner again back in the dinning room. Again it was disappointing and we said that tonight is the last night. The staff is not good, the food is bad and we are extremely disappointed. We're talking 3 generations of people, Grandparents, parents and kids that are 9 & 17. Carnival if your listing, you have a problem. Keep in mind people I was on another ship two weeks ago. The food was great!! So we ended the night watching a movie out by the pool on the big screen and it was awesome!!\n\nThursday, Day 5 - We arrived in Belize and there are a lot of fun things to do. If you can't snorkel, take the kids to Old Belize, check out the picks, the place was great!!  Dinner in the dinning room again! The food was really good tonight but the service was really slow. Comedy club after dinner was fun and a little piano bar to top everything off.\n\nFriday, Day 6 - Cozumel Mexico was a blast. We got off the boat early and we were one of the last ones on. Dinner in the dinning room again just sucked. This boat is just too big for the food and service to be as good as other ships I've been on. We watched a movie outside under the stars and enjoyed our last night with warm weather. \n\nSaturday, Day 7 - Day at sea, BBQ on the Lani deck again was great. Trivia, corn hole and another movie on the big screen under the stars. No dinning room tonight, it sucks we have to tip them. I discovered that the chicken quesadillas that room service offers may be the best I've ever had. Our bags are already outside and we are ready to disembark.  \n\nThe big ships are fun but service is sacrificed. What really sucks is that Carnival does not have the roads or the channels in place for a guests complaint to get heard by a person that has the ability to make a change. Policies and procedures are in place and rarely does change occur. This was my 4th cruise and my least favorite by far. The destinations were great, the ship was beautiful and the employees for the most part will bend over backwards for you.",

We were the only ones there and I went to order my food and said okay so that's it for that order, we're gonna have a second order and he said we actually can't do two orders and I understand that during a rush or something but we were the only ones there. So I said that and said well we are literally the only people in the drive thru, like what difference does it make? And he was like you can come in the store and do two orders and I was wasn't going to do that so I told him I would drive around again even though it was completely unnecessary. So I got my food and went around again (still no cars had been through the drive thru) and ordered a single coke. Not even food which made it more annoying. But anyways. So we got to the window and wanted to get more fries because they gave me a super small amount in my meal but we weren't gonna complain because we were already over this experience. So we were just gonna buy them. And so we asked if we could add on fries and she said no!! She literally said \"uhmmmmmm no\". And I was speechless. Needless to say. Screw them.",

  "text": "My son and I LOVE pizza, we could seriously eat it more times a week than would be healthy.  A few days ago I read Jackie W.'s review of SLNPC and I knew that we would have to give this place a try.  Fast forward to a lazy Sunday afternoon with both of us hungry and craving some pizza.  SLNPC is literally 5 blocks from our house, so it was a no brainer to give this place a try.  \n\nWe walk in and the place is empty, but it had only been open about 10 minutes so I didn't let that deter us.  We had our choice of seats and were quickly helped by Zack.  As we were already quite hungry and not wanting to wait for a pizza to be made, we just grabbed some slices.  I opted to go simple and just go with the peperoni like my son.  Six minutes later I was staring two large New York style pieces of pizza in the face.  Big B delivered our pizza and when I asked for a knife to cut my son's pizza up he quickly offered to take it back and cut it up for me.  That was really cool, as anyone who has tried to cut a giant piece of pizza into bite size pieces with a plastic knife knows is no easy task.  \n\nNow, on to the pizza.  It was delicious, I inhaled both of my giant pieces and my five year old son pretty much ate all of his piece.  He left about 3 bites and the crust.  I was completely full, but very satisfied.  To follow in tradition, I folded my slice in half and was please to see the bottom of the slice cooked perfectly.   \n\nZack was kind enough to offer my son a Popsicle which made him very happy.  Prices were pretty good for a per slice deal.  The prices on their signature pizzas were reasonable as well.  Next time I venture into this place I will have to try the Big Baller as Jackie W.'s description of it still makes me very hungry.    This visit ended with two big thumbs and two pint sized thumbs way up for Big B and his people at the SLNPC.  Keep up the good work and I'll be back to try more of your menu out.",

The tortilla soup that I ordered was piping hot which is HUGE, as it seems like there is an epidemic going around of lukewarm/underheated food. While I waited for it to cool, I sampled the garden salad that my dining companion ordered. For a side salad, the portion was generous. The balsamic vinaigrette was tasty and an elevated alternative to the usual oil and vinegar dressing. The coffee drinks looked inventive as well. For add ons, I recommend the Billy Goat Chips. One also can't go wrong with one of the chocolate-chip cookies (all of the baked goods and desserts are made in house).",

We caught a band called Washboard Rodeo, and they played some fun bluegrassy-type western swing. We'd made a 7:30 reservation via Open Table and were seated immediately. It's a small place, so any table you get is a good one. This is one of the few places on Frenchman Street that seems okay for children: mine are 9 and 11 and very capable of behaving well in a gastropub setting. The menu has a great baked mac & cheese and the waitresses are warm and welcoming. I have to say, after sampling the fish tacos, I sorta wish that I had ordered the mac & cheese, too! The tacos were okay but small and pretty bland. The mac & cheese was plentiful and well-seasoned. But this place is all about the music and the drinks, and on these they won me over. Had a simple Stella Artois apple cider (despite the great drink selection) and hubby enjoyed his porter. If you make a reservation, they give you 90 minutes to dine, which to me was more than enough. The band starts at 7pm on a weeknight, taking a 15-minute break around 8pm, and our 7:30 reservation gave us plenty of time to enjoy the music. If you visit New Orleans with older kiddies, I'd say give this place a go.",

  "text": "There were quite a few reasons why I could not give Cheu a five-star rating but it does not include the food. First, Cheu is a small location. There are only three tables crammed into a small nook which should onlyt. Second, VERY limited seating. Therefore, this place does not offer reservations, except in extreme cases, and seating it fills up fast. \n\nHowever, the food does come out at a fast rate so I cannot see why anyone would want to eat, relax and talk for a bit. The noise level is rather loud and the music does not help in that aspect. \n\nBesides those little annoyances, Cheu does offer delicious ramen that is worth the wait and crammed area. The secret lies in their small menu that is precise and allows to make ramen a specialty. I tasted ramen from other restaurants and the menus tend to be huge; lots of combinations, food seems rushed and put together; but not here. \n\nThe slices of brisket in my ramen was lean and non-fatty and the broth was absolutely delicious. Cheu does offer apps as well but you can feel up on the ramen alone; but if you must try an appetizer try the Garlic Wings or/and the Pizza Dumplings.\n\nBack to the ramen! I added an soft boiled egg that perfectly complemented the noodles and a Spiked Juice w/ Rum to top it off. Although the noodle bar is pricey the tasty and satisfying dishes makes it worth the investment",

  "text": "It was my 30th birthday, and Ralph's food was all that was on my mind.  I was thinking about veal since I knew that Italians really do make it best.  My husband and I stopped in to make a reservation for later that night and the host was very friendly and said \"We don't have anything open until 8:30pm\" but that was no problem for us and we just strolled around the surrounding area and stopped in a few shops while we were waiting.  At 8:15 we came back and our table was ready.  We sat down and were promptly served a nice cool glass of ice water.  My husband ordered an Italian Kiss which is some sort of espresso mixed drink.  He said it was out of this world.  A few minutes later we were served some delicious Italian bread and butter.  The bread was wonderful.  We then placed our order after looking over the menu.   We got the escargot as our appetizer.  This was absolutely wonderful!   My husband knew he wanted the Seafood Pescatore.  I decided to have the Veal Marsala and a side of meatballs.  We enjoyed our bread until our meals were brought out.  Now my Veal Marsala was hands down the best dinner out I have EVER had.  The veal was tender, the mushrooms were delicious, and the sauce,  well I think I had dreams about it that night.  My husband's dinner was also wonderful.  He used to prepare this himself and was surprised at how fresh and tender the mussels were .  He said he would get that again.  Now the meatballs are something you HAVE to get if you go to Ralph's!!!  These were nice and firm and the gravy was wonderful!  After all this good food we had to finish off the night with a cannoli.  My husband and I both ordered one and got one to go for my Dad.  Well those were crisp and the filling was the best i've ever had!    We will be returning to try more of their food.  Thank you Ralph's for making my 30th birthday incredible!",

A little very down homy type of place,with little atmosphere. Don't be fooled by the looks... But the lobster meal we had was super well worth it. We had two lobster bisque cups. Every spoon full had a large pieces of lobster chunks. It was excellent. Then we both had the lobster roll sandwich. Although the bread is not like Philadelphia quality, the lobster made up for it. The price did not out way the quality. A must do. At least once.",

  "text": "This place was just OK.  My fiancée and I shared their warm salad with vinaigrette as an app.  It was very interesting and flavorful.  Oddly enough, it was literally a head of romaine on a plate with vinaigrette, strawberries, tomatoes and blue cheese on top.  We both really enjoyed it.    For entrees, I got veal medallions with mozzarella and prosciutto in a mushroom sauce and my fiancée got their stuffed calamari in linguine.  Mine wasn't too bad although I was expecting the veal to be more tender.  It was slightly tough and dry.  Her calamari was surprisingly tough and chewy which kinda ruined things.\n\nAll in all, we had a good time.  It's a quaint place and the service was excellent.  The food just fell a bit short of our expectations.  It wasn't TOO expensive, but at this price point, the food should be better.  Unfortunately, I don't think we'll be back.",

  "text": "During the 80s as a child my family used to go to Micha's fairly often. Once I was on my own I didn't return for any particular reason. I always liked it and remember the food being very good with a decent atmosphere too. \n\nAfter a very long hiatus, I decided on whim to return with my own family. The atmosphere was still good, although the place was slightly worn around the edges in a good way. That's to be expected after almost a quarter of a century. It's a casual family place, not a fine dining establishment.\n\nThe food was still very good, maybe not quite up to par with what I remembered, but I don't know if that is just an artifact of memory or actual reality. We were served with only one bowl of tortilla chips with no refills offered. I don't know if refills cost extra, or if it was just laxness on our server's part. The chips were fresh and decent, but some weren't warm. The salsa was very good. I ordered the #17 combination plate, in which I had a red chili chimichanga along with refried beans and rice. The red chili had tender cubes of beef in a savory red chili sauce. At some Mexican restaurants the red chili sauce has a somewhat bland taste marred with a texture that is too thick presumably due to too much flour as a thickening agent. Not a Micha's as the sauce had just the right amount of thickness. Going overboard with red chili sauce, I ordered my chimi enchilada style, and it was very good and covered with melted cheddar cheese. The chimi itself was perfectly crisp on the outside with more of a non-fried flour tortilla texture on the inside, which is good but slightly different than the usual chimichangas in the area as they are more crispy throughout the tortilla wrapping. The refried bean were very flavorful and covered with melted cheese also. The rice was tasty, but it lukewarm and had a few cold clumps in it, so I would only say it was only fair. My wife had a carne asada burrito. It was good, but it was pretty dry and lacked the amount of onions and tomatoes that other places typically have. To counteract the dryness she ordered a side of guacamole, which also was a little atypical. The guacamole had a lot of onions, but the unusual part was that it also had some cottage cheese mixed in. Unusual, but good. One of my sons got a bean chimichanga, which was like mine in that it was crispy on the outside, but less so than other places on the inside. He liked it a lot. My other son ordered a machaca taco, chicken enchilada and rice. His plate looked good, and he said it was great. \n\nThe service was good but not great. Our server was for the most part all business and not overly friendly. The bus boy was very friendly, however.\n\nI would go back again. My kids loved it, and I thought it was good, but my wife was only partially impressed. So it won't be a place that we would frequent with any regularity, but I wouldn't hesitate to go again",

I understand that not everywhere has something I love, but I remained hopeful!\nThe inside is darling and has a promising ambiance. We were sat at a tiny table that was incredible unstable. Once we had our waters and coffee the table was nearly full and very shakey. Our server was an awkward girl who wouldn't look us in the eyes. \nI ordered the sweet potato hash with no eggs and my fiancée had duck fat gravy with biscuits. My meal had little to no flavor and I ended up using tobasco to make it resemble tasting like something.

It was more than enough for a meal but could have been split in two. The chicken was juicy and well cooked, but if you like spicy food you will need to add more hot sauce. The sides were also well made. I was interested in trying the bourbon whipped sweet potato but I'm glad I didn't. A friend had ordered it but didn't finish it because she said it wasn't good. I tried a bit of it and completely agreed. Idk if it was the bourbon or lack of seasoning but it just was not good. I usually will make plain sweet potatoes at home, boiled or baked, with a little salt and pepper and they have more flavor then this dish had. Other than that, what I enjoyed my meal. I would be interested in trying other options. It was great for a quick lunch, even with a long line we ordered and got our food pretty quickly. The staff was also really friendly.",

  "text": "This practice is amazing! The place is very nice and clean and such an efficient use of space. It is not a large office, but it doesn't need to be. And I really enjoyed their use of technology... I love the online portal , appointment making and online forms/resources. Even better is they have you sign in, take a photo and fill out your profile on a tablet. I also appreciated the automated email and text I received to remind me about my appointment. All of it made me feel that I was in a place with quality equipment and that valued having good technology.\n\nAnd all the staff are amazing from Nina at the front desk to Dr. Jeremy himself. They are personable and go out of their way to explain everything to you and make sure you are comfortable, educated and having a pleasant experience. It is very down to earth and not intimidating.\n\nThe best is that I have only had one appointment and my back is so much better.  I could feel instant relief and pressure disappear. I also appreciated Dr Jeremy's communication throughout the appointment. He always let me know what he was finding and how/when he was going to do the adjustment. I can't wait for my next appointment.",

  "text": "In a nutshell:  These guys are awesome to deal with.  They came on time;  They worked their butts off until the job was done;  They were very tidy and considerate of my property; and I got exactly what was promised at a fair price.\n\nThe Details:  When my A/C went on a hot summer day I thought ugh, I wish I knew someone in the field.  I didn't, so I started reading reviews and calling around.  The main HVAC repair companies around town came across as contractors (middlemen) that would just end up costing me more money in the end.  I knew what I wanted.  I wanted to deal directly with the guy who was going to do the work.  Someone who cared about customer satisfaction.  Someone I could trust.  I found all those things and more when I spoke to Ray, the owner and operator of Trust Home Comfort.\n\nWhen I read some of the reviews on the competition, it seemed that the biggest frustration out there were people who were charged a couple hundred of dollars to get a guy out, only to be told that their old A/C was not worth repairing.  I didn't want that to happen to me, so I took the unorthodox approach of taking a brief video of my problem and posting it to YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iMHhimCqUo .  This will be great, I thought.  Saves everyone time, and hopefully me some money.  Right?\n\nWishful thinking, none of the big companies were even willing to look at the video.  So I kept calling around.  Eventually, I got a hold of Van (the office guy) at Trust Home Comfort.  He was great!  He said \"Sure, we'll have a look at the video\", so I emailed him the link with some photos of my system.  I heard back a short time later from the owner of the company, Ray, who is a journeyman HVAC technician with a 4 year degree in Refrigeration Technology.  Ray told me straight up that he didn't think the problem was what I was hoping it would be (a low cost contactor part), but in order to know for sure he would have to come out and run a diagnostic.  They both reassured me that if I had to replace the entire system, I wouldn't be charged for the service call AND a new system.\n\nWhen Ray (the owner/technician) arrived the next day he took his electronic meter measurements, and was able to confirm that my compressor was shot.  I would need a new system. We sat down to discussed my options.  Ray was very honest and forthright about which system would be best for me.  He took his time and shared his experience about what other customers have liked. No high pressure sales.  No lies about pricing.  Just the straight honest goods you would expect from a technician.  I loved that.  We ended up upgrading our HVAC system to one of the new units that is VERY quite and comes with a 10 year parts warranty.  I think my neighbor was especially pleased with the \"quite\" part.\n\nRay was even willing to do the job on a long weekend, even though he planned on taking it off.\n\nAt the end of the day, we got a new \"Green\" A/C unit, a new updated humidifier, and a new WiFi thermostat which I can control from anywhere in the world through my iPhone.  All for a very reasonable price.  Very cool.  Literally!\n\n(My daughter's comment about this review:  \"Why don't you write a book\".)",
