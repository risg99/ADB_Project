  "text": "I really want to love this place, but they make it so hard. The past three times in a row I've been there, there has been some sort of ridiculous customer service issue that left me and whoever I was with super annoyed.\n\nStarting with the good: the coffee is delicious. The assortment of baked goods is great...quiche is yummy, etc. I've always loved the space...good mixture of comfy couches and real seating where people can sit and work on laptops. Plenty of outdoor seating on nice days.\n\nThe prices are...steep. BUT I always feel good about supporting a local small business, so whatever. My real problem is the 'tude and just general lack of professionalism that I've seen from the baristas. They clearly know their coffee, and that's great, but here are some of the more ridiculous things that have happened to me there in the past month:\n\n--purchased coffee with my mom and went to add our cream and sugar. My mom realized the half and half container was empty and gave the guy behind the counter a head's up. His answer: \"Yeah, we're actually out of half and half.\" Everyone stared blankly at him, including the other people in line. Now mind you, it was before noon, not five minutes before they closed. No apology, no \"I'm so sorry, we sent someone down the street to the 7-11 (literally down the street) to pick some up, they should be back any minute.\" That was it. The guy behind us asked, \"is anyone going to get some more?\" and the kid literally shrugged his shoulders and turned his back to us. Ummmmmm. As my mom said, when you charge people $8 for two coffees (one of which was just a drip coffee), I don't think it's too much to ask that you provide HALF AND HALF AT YOUR COFFEE SHOP. \n\n--another time I was there, a friend asked for her coffee extra hot, and then when it arrived just warm, she asked if they could nuke it in the microwave for a minute. She was very nice about it. The girl behind the counter, on the other hand, felt it necessary to explain in a condescending tone for five minutes that they \"actually can't put the coffee cups in the microwave\" for some reason I now forget, and then reluctantly offered to add some hot water. Uhhhh. Homegirl. Could you maybe just take the coffee and solve the problem? Put it in a to go cup and microwave it? This doesn't seem like THAT hard of a problem to solve, nor can I imagine it's the first time someone has asked for their coffee extra hot. Again, everyone in line sort of looked at each other helplessly as this happened. \n\n--this is a small thing, but they have multiple sizes for every drink on their board, but then half of them apparently only come in one size? I know it's a small issue, but you'd think it would occur to someone to change the menu so they don't have to keep telling people (last time I was there it happened to both me and the woman behind me). \n\nJersey Java owners, please give your baristas some basic lessons in customer service. Again, they know their coffee, and they're generally nice until there's ANY sort of minor hiccup, and then all basic common sense goes right out the window. Your coffee is too expensive for me to have some ordeal every time I go there. Oh, and buy more half and half.",

  "text": "There are restaurants with views and then there are views with restaurants. This belongs to the latter group. Had I known there was a view involved I would not have booked a table as the food is so often an afterthought and overpriced; this was no exception. The cooking was erratic, ranging from superb to amateurish. Fennel appetizer was sensational. Short ribs were dry and stringy and served tepid. The skate was perfect but the fettuccine lackluster. The light over our table was burned out so we ate in partial darkness which only served to highlight the short comings of the dishes. Loved the bread selection at the start and the shortbread cookies and jellies at the end were great! It's a good place for drinks and bar snacks and it feels special. If you care about the food, go elsewhere.",

  "text": "My husband and I were looking for a late lunch and wisely decided on 312. We were seated around 2 pm, and the restaurant was pleasantly busy. Our server was friendly and informative with the standard \"it takes 45 mins for a deep dish pizza\" warning. \n\nWe ordered 312s and an order of mozzarella sticks to start. The beer was a little warmer than I like, but the mozzarella sticks were perfection. Crispy and hot with melty, gooey cheese. Yum. \n\nOur pizza was well worth the wait. The deep dish \"Stockyard Patty\" came with a buttery crust, slightly sweet sauce, and a perfect disc of sausage. Our pizza was piping hot and drool-worthy. Definitely reminiscent of Lou Malnati's or Gino's East deep dish pies in Chicago. We will be back for sure!",

The restaurant felt more like a sports bar with all the TVs on and the pop music blaring so loud it made it difficult to focus on my date.  I got the Stanford (turkey burger) and zucchini straws.  The straws where much better than my burger that lacked any real taste.  My date got the Going Greek (lamb burger) and loaded potato salad and once again the side was better than the burger.  I've had better burgers for much less.  I will try it again with a more traditional beef burger to see if it was just the non traditional that didn't work for us.",

So, there I sat a few days later, awaiting this highly sought after ground beef wonder. The service was really good and very friendly, and the overall atmosphere is pretty good, though unmemorable.\n\nThen came the burger.\n\nIt was pretty tasty, though I'm pretty sure their secret is salt.

I don't always like a ton of salt, but when I do, I'd go to National Underground for a cheeseburger.",

I got a mug of hot chocolate (standard size) and picked up a chocolate bar from the counter display for later.  There was no price on the chocolate bar or the display, but the total for these two things came out to around $12.  Whatever the breakdown was, at least one of these items was vastly overpriced.  They were good, though, so that earns the place an extra star.  One of the other reviews mentioned that high-schoolers hang out here.  They must have some good part-time jobs.",

A brunch place that I don't need to go into the city for or a global chain restaurant.\n\nI have been here for breakfast & lunch (Marlton & Cherry Hill)  and both times I have been here the food has been spot on!! Everyone at our table enjoyed their food!!  The food is fresh, unique & not greasy like some diner food in the area. I recommend the Marsala Eggs Benedict very good & different and the Benedict sauce was tasty just wish the sauce was a little warmer. I like my poached eggs juicy 1 of the eggs was over cooked for me. I would recommend telling them how you like your eggs cooked. Overall a great place for sunday brunch!! Also don't forget the champange for mamosas!!   \n\nThe wait staff is also great!! Very accommodating without the hidden charges!!  They asked if we would like any of our drinks in a to-go cup.\n\nTurning Point I recommend that you serve the Marsala Benedict in the big spoon serving dish like the others benedict dishes that is a great way of keeping the sauce from the potatoes & everything all on one plate",

The Caesar salad had freshly grilled chicken and thick shavings of parmesan. The oyster po boy was full of outstanding oysters and served on really good bread.

I've been here a few times with them and have never been impressed, but after today felt the need to write about it.\n\nUsually when I order a 7-9 dollar cheesesteak I save half for another time so I don't feel like I'm over-eating. When my chicken cheesesteak was put in front of me today I had to ask the waiter if the cook accidentally used only half the normal portion of meat. I've never seen such an empty steak sandwich in my life and easily housed the whole thing, plus the measly pickle spear and miniature bag of chips. \n\nAfter confronting the waiter he asked me if I wanted another and I told him \"no, not if this is the normal portion size. Do they always look so empty?\" I won't quote the waiter exactly but his reply was along the lines of that's the normal portion size but the chef doesn't know what he's doing and that's why it looks small. \n\nThis was a disgrace of a cheesesteak, and thus worthy of a 2 star review considering all the times I've eaten here in the past have been a solid \"Meh\".",

For our main course we both had the stuffed grouper which was also great. When most restaurants say crab stuffed something, they mean breading with a little crab. Not here, there was so much crab I don't know if there was any breading. And sooo good!! \n\nFor a side, get the Parmesan risotto also amazing!\n\nWe had such a good time we are sure to visit next time we are in town!",

The mixture of flavors were unique and delicious. The chef has acquired ideas from his studies in both South America and Europe.

I love good beer but I will drink it whether I think it is amazing or awful. I got 4 of their current seasonal beers in a sampler (batch 100, winter warmer, undead black IPA and paramount). They were decent, nothing to write home about or come back the next day for. The reason they lose points from last night was because of the food, not the beer.  Got a black and blue burger. It had just too much blue cheese on the burger and the meat was just alright and they also skimped on the fries. The price is steep for their higher end food but I think their entrees are very good and will stick with those for next time.\n\nP.S. For anyone looking to avoid big parties, babies and young kids (1-12 years old) I have always seen a big group of people who decide to bring their children with them. Kids never bother me but they are kids so they make noise and run around the restaurant. Not much you can do about it besides sitting at the bar.",

They came out hot, crispy, and a little oily, delicious.\n\nThe tonkatsu chicken and fried tofu bao were both delicious. All the condiments on their bao make for a sort of savory, sort of sweet flavor combo (cilantro, sweet sauce, and a few other things I don't remember off the top of my head)\n\nThe popcorn chicken was also excellent. Tiny, very crispy bits of chicken served with rice and a potato salad. I didn't try the potato salad, but heard it was more of a macaroni salad. \n\nI highly recommend Taiwan 101.

The menu was confusing as they have fresh fish on the menu but if it does not have a checkmark beside it they do not currently have it. I wanted halibut but there was no checkmark. So I asked the waitress for a recommendation. She recommended the snapper dish. So I ordered that. Then the server came back to tell me the snapper was still frozen solid. The chef recommended I get the red fish but I did not want that. So I got the swordfish.  It was good but I was disappointed.  The waitress was friendly and took good care of us. I said well get me a discount since you didn't have what I wanted. No discount and no manager came out to apologize for not having dishes ready to go for a Friday lunch. We will probably come back but are disappointed in this trip to one of our favorite restaurants.

The outside seating area is BEAUTIFUL and overlooks the water. The first time I went, I had the \"world's best\" turkey sandwich which is VERY true to the name. Literally the best sandwich I've ever had. I wish I could have that sandwich every day. The next time I went with a large group and we did the bottomless mimosas and bottomless brunch. It's a bit expensive, but as long as you come hungry and thirsty you definitely get your money's worth! You can also make reservations ahead of time which is nice! If your looking for a place with great food and an awesome view, definitely come here!",

The atmosphere is great, service is great, and the food is amazing. Not only are their donuts tasty as heck, but their sliders are to die for as well. If you are a donut fan or just a sweet-tooth, you got to try this place. NOTE: The food truck that you might see around town, IMO, does not have the same quality. Go to the location on Magazine St.",

I don't the know owners name but he is the nicest guy. Very friendly. The food was delicious but it might have been wise for us to confirm what we thought we were ordering. Indian food is delicious but I am horrible at remembering what I ordered before. Unfortunately this review is another victim of my not being able to remember the names of what we ordered. One dish was mostly spinach (a total hit), another was some red chicken dish (perfectly cooked but looked like it was dyed red), and naan which is everyone's favorite. If you know your Indian dishes you won't be disappointed. Kids are always welcome there. Be sure to enjoy downtown while you're there.",

When asked to sample a few we were told that we could only pay for a 4 oz. sample for $1.75 but she would ask the manager. She then came back and said no we could not sample without paying. I have been to many tap rooms across America and never charged to taste, my advise to management is to change this policy.  Our party also ordered food, that was good but not great.",

In some ways, Ghini's reminds me of the Hotel Congress' Cup Cafe, but quieter and more laid-back. I've been here for breakfast, lunch, and desserts. Ghini's is a popular place with a solid reputation---and the bakery next door is a favorite too. I'm awarding the cafe four stars instead of five because the place does get a little chaotic during the peak times (again, just like the Cup) and I can see how a first-time visitor might find that off-putting. All in all, I recommend you try Ghini's and discover one of Tucson's delights. Enjoy!",

You walk in and go to the register where you look at the menu, order and pay.  Then you look for a seat.  This can be annoying and not group friendly.  Sometimes you will wait and wait and wait and almost get your food with no where to sit.  It hasnt happened to me but I am a spaz and always think it will.\n\nThe food is great.  Last time I got the jalepeno pork over grits.  It was fantastic and not too spicy.  Very very good.  My lady got the smoked salmon omelet with fried capers and it was really good too.  Very great food and interesting menu with the standard breakfast options as well.\n\nThe owner is moving around the floor the whole time and he is really really nice.  All of the staff is nice.  \n\nMy only real comlaint is that for me the ordering/waiting thing is a little stressful and can sometimes stop you from even enjoying your food lesiurely cuz a million people are standing there looking for the next available table.\n\nGreat food though.",

I had veggie enchiladas w green sauce and it was flavorful and complex and not watery like most other Mexican veggie  dishes around town.   Im so impressed and happy to find this gem. My partner had  chicken enchiladas with red sauce and refried beans.  The red sauce reminded me of the sauce an immigrant woman I worked with used to make for potlucks.  I know I am shamelessly gushing but if you read my other reviews then you will know that it's not typical. The bartender Iris is very helpful and was a great server. Also one more thing, I want to mention the spicy margarita. It is now my new favorite drink in town. It has cilantro jalapeño and (I believe) cucumber and it is amazing.",

Both places are quite similar, but FC had an air of pretentiousness that Boilermaker didn't.  FC was also considerably more expensive for smaller portions whereas Boilermaker's beers and food were reasonably-priced.\n\nTheir beer week offerings featured over a dozen from their brewery, Cabinet Artisinal Brewhouse which are mainly sour and/or really interesting beers.  I absolutely loved everything I tried.  One of the two bartenders was very knowledgeable and all were helpful.  We ordered their hot dog plate which was 2 bacon-wrapped hot dogs with a mountain of fries for $9 which is a pretty good deal IMO.\n\nUnfortunately, I just read that the headbrewer is leaving Cabinet Artisinal Brewhouse.  Hopefully they can get another highly skilled brewer to continue pumping out unique brews (especially my beloved sours) as their beers were a big reason I'd go back to this place.",

Not only were we an apparent nuisance to the baristas reviewing Halloween costumes with their (boy)friends, but also were treated with, as one other customer said, much shade.\n\nI brought my own cup in which to have my coffee. However, when I asked if she could put the drink in my cup, I received elevator eyes, a smirk, and a clear, \"No\". Ok, I thought, sometimes sizes are difficult to estimate in a different cup.\n\nThen, as we were sitting down enjoying our coffees, I turned around to look at the counter for WiFi info. I received a stern look from the barista, who then exclaimed \"Can I hep you with something?\", to which I responded, \"oh, I was just looking if you had WiFi.\" The barista responded, \"We have a sign, for you,\" again with a plethora of shade.\n\nWill never return, thanks for trying.",

  "text": "You get what you see--chicken fingers. They also serve wings and other overpriced items like mac and cheese (mediocre) and pastries (meh). \n\nThe sauces are unique and probably the best part about this place as you won't be able to find sauces like this elsewhere. Be watchful of how full the sauce is because some of the containers are not completely full and you get jipped. Sadly you can't sample the sauces without having to buy them. My favorite is bar b q sauce. It has a slight acidic vinegar kick, but isn't bittersweet. Maybe they cut back on the sugar? The chipotle lime mayo is great. It isn't too creamy and oily. The chipotle is subtle, almost dull and a little bit more would make it better and bold. I found myself having to double dunk the chicken in this sauce to really taste it. You always finish it wishing you had a little more. I've tried almost all of them and none of them are too memorable that I can recall anything great or bad about the rest of the sauces.\n\nThe breading is thin and crisp, which I appreciate. With one bite you taste the breading and chicken, and not just breading on heavily breaded chicken that other places might serve. The breading can be over salty and seasoned too much. Don't mistake this for rich and intense. It is salty. I end up drinking a lot of water with this meal partially due to this. What makes the breading suck is that it is not always fresh. Who knows how long the chicken has been sitting out.\n\nThe meat can be hit or miss; the chicken can be a little parched. This is disappointing when you have a whole pound of chicken to consume that will leave your mouth dry and leave you bloated after you drink a lot to quench your thirst and high sodium intake. More often then not, I always get the dried, salty chicken instead of the juicy, tender chicken that I once got at my very first visit. Perhaps I am unlucky and get the left over stale pieces that have been sitting out long. I can only recall once when my chicken was tender and juicy when they first opened.I try to avoid wasting money here because I have not had the same type of meal since my first. However, out of desperation to try something different than the usual univ city food, I have eaten here a few times to make this review justified.\n\nWhat my friends and I would like to do is split up and someone get french fries from Greek Lady and the others get chicken from Wishbone. We would satisfy our elementary palates by eating chicken fingers and french fries. If you are willing to walk a few more blocks, Allegros has really good curly fries but portions are a lot bigger when you eat at the place.\n\nI would have given this place 1.5 stars for the food, but they once cancelled a chicken wing eating contest on my friends and me just hours prior to the event with poor explanation so I knock it down to 0.5 stars, but yelp doesn't have 0.5 increments.",

  "text": "My review is primarily about delivery and customer service.  \n\nDelivery.\nI have attempted (by myself and with friends/family) to have Reginelli's delivered to my house on four separate occasions in the last year.  The first time it came within the stated time frame and was ok, so we continued to order.  The last three times I've ordered Reginelli's they always say that delivery will be about 45 minutes (thats ok) but when the hour mark occurs I usually give them a call to ask as to the status of my order.  They always say, \"We're sorry, we suddenly got really busy, its on its way.\"  (This wasn't on a weekend, holiday or Mardi Gras, so go figure about the sudden rush)\n\n...\n\nMy pizza finally arrived somewhere around the 2 hr mark and was stone cold (all three times).  The first time I called them back to complain and the lady on the phone basically said, \"We're sorry, we'll replace it but it will be at least hour and a half before we get it to you.\"   The last two times, I didn't even bother to call.  \n\nIf a pizza delivery comes late once, thats understandable, it does happen, but when it happens three times with the same company then its time to call someone else.",

I did two scrambled eggs with chopped up basil folded in, hash-browns, and biscuits with apricot jam. The eggs were incredible! Fluffy yet firm, but not overcooked. The basil was a perfect addition to fill out the flavor of otherwise bland eggs. The biscuits were pretty much out of this world. I'm going to say they were the best biscuits I've ever had. And the jam?! Oh the jam. Don't even get me started! The hash-browns on the other hand feel short. Not much flavor, soft, and sort of cold. I asked for them well done, but that didn't really happen, and that bummed me out a little. \n\nService was a little off too. It was busy- CRAZY busy, so I imagine they were strapped to get people seated and get food in their mouths timely, but I had to wait a little longer for a server to come over. Once he took my order though everything moved along like clock work. And so I'll hit em up again, it was breakfast well done. And next time I'll make sure the hash-browns are well done too!",

The buffet was not good at all even compared to other buffets.  I think the reason I felt that way immediately was I got 3 buffets and a 25 dollar game card that ended up costing over 50 dollars.  Doesn't sound too bad to get 3 buffets and some games but once you get in and see the buffet and the prices of the games it isn't worth it.  The buffet was only half open and the pizza wasn't hot.  The kids didn't seem to care because they were excited to play games.  Once we finished eating we went to the game area and things got worse.  5 frames of bowling for two kids  = $7!!!  Terrible.  Two go cart rides that was less than 3 minutes = $8.  2 roller coaster rides = $13!!!!!!!!  15 minutes and 25 bucks was gone!  I will say the employees were friendly and smiled.  However, we won't be back simply because for that price there are way better things to do.",

My friend just patiently waited. and when the bartender realized he forgot, he wasn't even apologetic. \n\nDon't waste your money on this place, go to Latitude 29 where the bartenders are nice and accommodating, the drinks are better at Latitude anyway in my opinion.",

  "text": "Before I even start this review I have to thank my fellow yelpers. There is no way I, or anyone for that matter, would have found this place if it weren't for someone just like you doing a review. Thanks guys!\n\nTucked away in a strip shopping center, albeit a cute shopping center, is this little non descript  restaurant. Since it was early in the day, we really weren't worried about a reservation although I did call as a just in case measure.\n\nWe wanted to sit outside since the back looks so pretty but were told it was closed but were led instead to an enclosed patio. Still nice. \n\nNicer still was when our server brought us bread, olive oil and a plate of marinated cannelloni beans with yellow and green squash. Wow! The squash were just a tad bland and needed salt but the beans were really flavorful.\n\nMy husband ordered the squash blossoms stuffed with ricotta and mozzarella cheese and I the beef carpaccio. Although I did miss capers on the beef and there was too much salad, both the dishes were really good.\n\nNow, our server gave us the list of specials and mentioned that two of them were served with langostines. I had seen these on one of the cooking shows but didn't know exactly what they were. My husband ordered the Carbonarra and I got the Langostines with a blush sauce served with lump crab and fresh tomato.\n\nMy dish was pricey, yes it was but incredibly worth it. Imagine a cross between a lobster, a shrimp and butter. Really. The langostines simply melt in your mouth leaving happiness behind. The carbonarra with panchetta instead of bacon my husband ordered is the best I've ever ordered or even tried to make. \n\nAs I've said, we were really early so we got to watch the prep of the restaurant between the the lunch and the dinner service. It was truly a privilege. These servers went through the place with precision, dusting, wiping, washing and primping every aspect of the restaurant. \n\nIf you go, and you should, bring a nice bottle of wine, order the langostines and the tiramisu. Enjoy!",

I wasn't sure what I'd find at Hendricks but I was pleasantly surprised as I was driving through the neighborhood. I liked the small town feel. Since I was by myself, I had planned on taking it to go and eating at the hotel but after walking inside, I had to stay to enjoy the decor. Light bulbs in mason jars, flat screen TV's and an amazing lighted patio. Although the view is just a parking lot, it's too bad it wasn't closer to the river behind it or had something else to look at. \n\nI ordered pork steak (which I've never heard of before) and it was really good. It looked like a T-bone but was tender enough to be cut with a fork. For my sides, I chose collard greens and cole slaw. The cole slaw was awesome. I have a weird ritual where I always order the cole slaw at different places to see how they make it. This one is definitely in my top 5. The slaw was finely chopped and had ground pepper in it, which I love. I usually put black pepper in my slaw anyways but this one was perfect. Cold and with a kick. Collard greens with a bit of bacon in it was good too. If I had more time or with a group of friends, I'd definitely come back because everything looked comfortably country.",

I'm going to give the place the benefit of the doubt that it is not always like this as we came in at 10 PM, but if you cannot offer quality food at that hour then don't have your kitchen open. \nAll of our food came out within 5 to 10 minutes of ordering which leads me to believe it was not made fresh. The Caesar salad was room temperature and overdressed. The hush puppies were flavorless, and the chicken wings (3 full wings is a serving) were undercooked and barely warm. The only redeeming food item was the chicken and biscuits, which had a nice flavor profile- the biscuit was again, cold in spots. \n\nOn the positive side the place has a nice hip atmosphere and the service is friendly. \n\nUnfortunately, the food was so sub par we would not consider dining here again.",

I'm definitely gonna stay away from that part of town after 4ish as that's when the \"heavy hitters\" come in to support the greasy, dirty, place that really only cares about their gamblers.  The kitchen has some kinda mold issues that literally smells like a sewer plant.  The 2 gals that have made a career outta this dump rely on the drunkards to tip them \"big\" if they win on the slots.  This is a very sad version of any kinda chicken joint or sports bar.  The greed that the owners share is obvious as flat screens are cheap these days and these guys can't even loosen their hands on the \"gambling profit\" to invest in to this dump.   Is sad as the original owners did a great job and these new guys don't care about anything except the profit from the slot machines, including the nasty food they serve.  The bartenders are high-strung and anything but friendly, unless of course, you are gambling big and they have a chance at a big tip.  \nYour better off going to the fast food chicken joint across the stree t\"El Pollo Loco\" and guessing the kitchen is cleaner and the staff is friendlier and you won't be subjected to the daily drunks that drive to and from this place daily.  VERY SCARY!!!",

Waitress helped my wife take off her jacket as her hands were full with our baby, as I was tied up with the 3yr old.\n\nI had Chicken Katsu Curry Ramen, Sister had Shrimp Katsu Ramen & Wife had Shoyu Ramen. Everything was excellent, I loved mine. Curry soup was tasty &I the fried chicken was done just right. Same for my sisters shrimp, fried just right with good quality shrimp. My wife lived her Shoyu Ramen.\n\nWe also got the pork buns which were excellent, but not your traditional porkbun. \n\nGreat, great experience.",

My son and I had something called the wildflower triple that had scrambled eggs, bacon, and a waffle.  The waffles were very yummy were tender with the perfect golden crisp to them.  The bacon was a great balance of crispy without being over cooked.  \n\nPrices seemed reasonable to me, most items in the $5-8 range if I remember correctly.  Mine was $7.75 I think.\n\nOne last note is that they had good portion sizes.  The portion sizes are filling, without being super sized.  I was afraid when I order something called a triple it would be WAY too much food (even though the price was inline with other items on the menu).  It was two eggs, two pieces of bacon, and a deep pocket waffle the size of a coaster.  If you like huge portions of food look elsewhere.",

  "text": "Philadelphia, I love you.  Places like this remind me why.  We sat at the counter and watched the guys make the pizzas.  Our son hates cheese on a pizza and they had one already on the menu for him: The Marinara (oregano, crushed san marzano tomatoes, garlic, olive oil).  It was simple... but delicious. If you like real wood-fired pizzas that char the crust (a little blackened... in a good way), this is the place to go to.  Our other favorite pizza joints that rival this place are Lombardi's (NYC) and Grimaldi's (Brooklyn).  We all had a slice and were shocked at the lovely simplicity of it. Razor thin slices of garlic dotted the fresh tomato sauce.  My husband and I shared the Salsiccia (fennel sausage, roasted fennel, tomato sauce, mozzarella).  Roasted fennel on a pizza?  Brilliant. I cried a little.  No wait... I REALLY cried when we shared this cocktail: The Brooklyn (Dad's Hat rye, Luxardo cherry, white vermouth).  It says it serves one, but they brought it out in a cute little bottle and gave us each a glass...each with a hand- crafted giant square ice cube (hipster-cool) and Luxardo cherries.  Perfection.  We also shared a Rotolo (pizza dough, mortadella, ricotta, pistacchio pesto).  Those are crazy amazing.  I kept saying my husband could eat the rest... then freaking out and going back for another bite. He's lucky I didn't stab him in the hand with a fork to fight over the last bite (to be fair, he was the smart one who ordered it).  I could've eaten several of those and forgotten the pizza (although that was wonderful too!).  We finished with a little dessert... perfect little Italian cookies (\"Cookie Jar\" - pignoli, almond cookies, chocolate biscotti, pistacchio gnocchi) and I got an Affogato (fiordilatte soft serve with a shot of espresso).  The soft serve is Italian sweet cream... decadent and lovely... with rich espresso in a pretty little Italian mug.  I'm in Heaven here.  I know nothing about Vetri's other restaurants, but I'm checking them out next time I'm in Philadelphia!  By the way... service was great and friendly.  5 stars all around!",

The amount of food you get is fair but I think it'd be easier to justify if you got a little more. \n\nThere's plenty of seating. Despite being near a whole bunch of bar/club scenes, once you're inside it's easy to take a break and have a nice conversation. It is all very clean and well kept. The servers are quick and friendly. When I went there were only two guys working but they weren't busy so it didn't take too long. The entire restaurant is very dimly lit and the atmosphere is a bit of a hodgepodge of things. On one wall there is a mural of outer space and the music that plays seems to have no rhyme or reason to it. \n\nIt's a bit of a strange place but I would definitely go back.",

  "text": "When giving friends from out of town a tour of the French Quarter, one can only expect they want some classic New Orleans dishes. I've been here a couple of times, but they were the ones that wanted to go, due to their lunch special. It's a nice, well know restaurant that offers a 17.00 lunch special that includes a soup or salad, entree, and the option for a 4.00 Bloody Mary or martini. I got the Bloody Mary and it was a great size for the price. It was spicy and hit the spot.\nThey text message you when your table is ready, so were able to walk around the quarter while we waited. Thank god a lot of restaurants are getting rid of the those buzzers that make you feel like you are under house arrest. \nWe sat down to a beautiful table right by the open shutters. The servers, were ok. They were busy, but forgot a couple of things we asked for. It was still a great experience though!\nI got the pork chop with red beans and the turtle soup. The turtle soup was one of the best I have had. The pork chop was cooked to perfection and the read beans were seasoned very well. It came with cornbread, but it was very dry. After this lunch at noon, I didn't find myself hungry till it was basically time for bed. It was a very generous portion and well worth the money.\n\nMuriel's is a great way to get a classic, good quality New Orleans meal at a decent price. The location is spectacular, and the history behind the restaurant made for great conversation at the table.\nDefinitely check it out if you are in the Quarter!",

My sister is a vegetarian and often has a hard time finding good options when we go out, so she was delighted to see a variety of great choices (the mushroom empanadas were her favorite!). \n\nThe service was really great--the waiter was really helpful in helping us pick out beers/cocktails (try the sangria!). Great restaurant!",

  "text": "Delicious! \n\nI wish they took reservations, but my friend and her fiance go there nice and early so that we could snag a seat inside (it was cold out!). \n\nWe ordered the bianco salad ( to share between 2) and the western addition (to share between 4).\n\nI thought the salad was tasty but nothing special, despite the white chocolate shavings. Cute idea, but not enough crunch or pizazz to make the salad seem really fabulous.\n\nThe pizza, however, was pretty darn good. We ordered it deep dish to try their special cornmeal crust and were pretty impressed. \nThe crust tastes a little bit like cornbread, a little bit like pizza dough, a tiny bit like grease (the good kind) and a lot like YUM!\n\nI don't know if it was the best pizza I've ever had, but it was very good. It would be even better if it were a tad cheaper, and didn't get so crowded! But definitely worth a visit if you're in the area!",

  "text": "I originally gave b.good a 4 star review and it was basically: If you're in the market for a burger, salad, or kale/quinoa bowl that's made with real & not-processed ingredients, go to b.good. I also gave them props for the fact that even their sodas and condiments didn't have HFCS or artificial ingredients. I was disappointed that the value of the meal seems a little lackluster, being quite pricey for what you get.\n\nI have to knock this original review from 4 stars to 3 stars though because b.good is consistently slow in getting your food ready for you and the friendliness of the service is typically iffy, depending on who's serving you though. And yes, I know you can do online ordering to help with the wait times but as far as I'm concerned, there's no reason why you should have to do online ordering for 'fast food'.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, b.good is trying to market themselves as real fast food. The food is real, but it's definitely not fast, and I don't know if it warrants the prices they're charging with the service they provide. That and considering how there are so many awesome/similar eateries in that shopping center already (like Zoes Kitchen, Chipotle, & Panera Bread), it's hard for me to keep b.good at a 4 star.",

We had the pepperoni, socrates revenge, and bronx bomber.  It's like a eatting a brick of salt.  I'm not sure if it's the amount of salt sauce combined with the salty meat, but the combo so overwhelming, I tastebuds are numb to any other flavor.  Otherwise, if they fix that, I would love it.  \n\nAs for the salads, they're a good size, but seems like something you can toss together yourself.  I usually not get because don't want to spend the money on it.",

Our egg drop soup came out right away at a nice piping hot temperature and when the rest of our food came out it was practically room temperature. \n\nFeeling adventurous, I had ordered the Shrimp with Candied Walnuts entree with brown rice while he ordered the Sesame Chicken platter. I like the idea of sharing food, but my food was too busy all on its own without adding something else to the mix. The brown rice was cold and very bland while the shrimp was overly sweet and I didn't feel like the candied walnuts and melon balls were complementary flavors.\n\nThe chocolate cake we had for dessert was amazing though; 6 layers of chocolate on chocolate. It was so sweet and rich, we ended up sharing a slice.\n\nSo to sum up, service was great, dessert was great, but the food needs some work. Sorry PF Changs, I just am not impressed.\n\nOne thing I will note (that our server told us) is that they are very big on catering to food allergies (especially gluten).",

It works in a pinch if you're in the mood for pork! \n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered combos, both including pulled pork and spare ribs. While the ribs were smoked and tasty, they were a little tough compared to what we're normally used to. My boyfriend happened to like the pulled pork, but I felt that I could've made better at home. It was bland and seemed like it didn't have any seasoning at all. \n\nThe sides don't offer too much to chose from. There is a variety of \"dressing-\" covered starches, like potato and macaroni salads, but the only worthwhile side we tried was the cornbread pudding. I highly recommend it if you find yourself here. It's more of a bread than pudding and is at a sweetness level that can be enjoyed as a side instead of dessert. \n\nNow for the most important part, the sauces! One was a vinegar based spicy concoction that we mostly stayed away from and there was another \"mango\" flavored one that barely tasted like the fruit. The best is their sweet sauce, which is thick and similar to Sweet Baby Rays but with a little extra kick. It was great! \n\nThe service, location and pretty much everything else was pretty good, but unfortunately, we felt the BBQ could've been better and that there could've been more side selections like french fries or mac'n'cheese.",

  "text": "1  Fried Meat Dumplings  $ 5.25\n1  General Tso's Dinner Box  $ 7.75\n\nI gave this a four stars but let me clarify. It is what it is. It's greasy unhealthy American-Chinese food thats cheap and has way too much salt. You know they don't serve general tso's in China right? But for what it is it's a cheap and solid dinner. The General Tso's Dinner box is is a typical combo of egg roll rice and the chicken. It's pretty good but I'd only say it's an average 3 stars, nothing sticks out. The real reason I order from Golden Chopsticks quite often is their fried meat dumplings. These are the thick heavy doughy dumplings, not the thin potstickers you might be used to and you get 8 with an order for less than 6 bucks. It's a lot of food and make sure you sleep with water next to your bed because it's very salty, in a good way. So again for what they are aiming for, they do a pretty decent job. Don't skip on the dumplings!",

  "text": "A little outside of downtown Indianapolis is an area called Broad Ripple, and here you can find a place that transports you to a modern pristine Parisian bakery. You literally walk in and no longer feel like you are in Indiana. Everything is sparkly and glittery, and the smells are divine. \n\nWe made the trek by uber to this neighborhood and really wanted to try this place! We arrived around 11 for an \"early lunch\" slash \"snack\". We ordered the quiche of the day which was quiche Lorraine and the famous Earls Court Chocolate Cake.\n\nThe quiche was quite delicious. The egg was so fluffy and savory while the crust was super flaky and had a great bacon flavor.  This was a perfect snack to split between 2 people and just hit the spot!\n\nIt was so hard to decide which cake to try. One gripe that I have about this place is the price of the cake slices. The slices are quite large and pricey. If you only come with 2 people it is hard to get a few things to share without either breaking the bank or stuffing your face with dessert. I asked if we could do 1/2 slices, but was politely denied. A suggestion I have would be to allow fractions of slices so people can try multiple different cakes.\n\nMy wife loves chocolate and I love all sweets so we opted for the famous chocolate cake. There was so much great chocolate flavor and for the most part, the cake was super moist. It seemed like the edges of the cake might have been a little over cooked/on the dryer side but the flavor was delightful!",

Want organics and quality? Incredible fruit and veggies section. Amazing beer and wine (my mouth watered at the $450 bottle of Dom Perignon!) There is amazing looking sushi prepared fresh. I bought a tiny baguette that is the freshest and tastiest bread I have ever eaten. The selection is amazing, you will find things from all over the world. They get rare and unusual items so it costs more. \n\nI don't think AJs is snobby. I did get some weird looks from the employees when I showed up in my ratty shirt and shoes, but I know what I want there and get great quality things that go into my body. And there are better and better deals the more you show up, just like any other grocery store. I'd rather get some things here than anywhere else in town. AJ's is a place to explore more. And there are no homeless people or ghetto customers in line , which I love!\n\nI probably can't or won't shop here too often since, you know, I like to pay rent and bills and stuff. But for specialty items and rarer beers and things, this is the place. It's also fun to browse. Totally good times.",

There is a ton to choose from, even if you're vegetarian.  \nFormalities first--why can't there be some ambiance at Indian restaurants.  I know I'm painting with broad strokes here, but it seems like outside of NYC, no Indian restaurant in the US can get creative with their dining space.  Not sure why that is, but whatever.\nAn early arrival on a Sunday found the place quiet, with maybe 10 or so people dining.  No problem getting a table for 2.  We started the evening off with some garlic Naan.  Delicious, although I think next time I'll stick with regular, at almost half the cost.  We also got some Finger Paneer, little spiced fried cubes of cheese.  These were denser than typical Paneer.  The cheese was slightly bland, but the spices were good.  Overall, an enjoyable start to the meal.  I also had a lemonade, which may have been made fresh.  Regardless, it was tasty. \nEntrees included Paneer Bhurji and Lamb Shahi Korma.  We elected \"spicy\" as our seasoning level.  I'll admit, I have a pretty strong ability to deal with spiciness.  But this was some ultra-spicy food when it arrived!  We quickly ordered a mango lassi to help put out the fire.  Still, even through the spices, there were decent flavors coming through.  The nutiness of the Korma was especially nice, as was the blended creaminess.\nI'm intrigued enough to return for more offerings.  I am humbled however by their spiciness--something that has not happened to me in many many years.  Next time, I am going to stick with \"medium\" spiciness!",

It is really a beautiful surrounding for a restaurant.  Although I am an old church architecture nerd.  It was really cool to look around.   \n\nThe service was incredible.  I was hear as part of a group of 7 other characters, several were part of the NOLA restaurant scene.  We wanted a good time with the meal and they provided it!   \n\nPaneed smoked soft shell crab a la Christian.  I was not fortunate enough to have enjoyed the original.  I can not comment on the faithfulness to the founders recipe.  I can say this there is no highe calling for a soft shell crab than to be cold smoked and fried in preparation for this dish.  On to your 77 virgins and mecca for you!  But I experienced heaven eating this.  \n\nSeafood stuffed filet of fish a la Christian's - This was superlative.  Again did not try the original, but the mirliton and seafood stuffing was heavenly, and more importantly improved the taste of the fresh flounder rather than competing for the spot light!   \n\nThe combination was quite possibly one of the 10 best meals of my life.

The waitress we had was as good as ones we've had in previous locations: super cheerful, adorable, and prompt at checking on drinks and clearing away the plates.\n\nWe went today to check out Pliny the Younger, and while the ensuing scene was a little chaotic (maybe drink tickets would have been easier?) with two lines on either side of the store, they did the best they could, letting in 10 people at a time until the restaurant was filled. We were worried about our friend, who was running late and doesn't like beer, not being allowed in, but she had no problems after letting the host know we were waiting for her.\n\nThe food was also delicious. We all shared the Asturian Blue cheese which was nicely complimented by a blackberry sauce, I had the wild mushroom sandwich which had a lovely lemony flavor, my boyfriend had the three cheese sandwich (which I have ordered before and is quite good), and our friend had the truffled egg toast, which we have also tried before and is one of the standout starter items.\n\nAll in all, I have yet to be disappointed by an experience at a Tria in either location, even with these crazy extenuating circumstances!",

Way, way garlic heavy and runny, runny sauce.  Hubby had an average burger.  We both remembered it being loud, but we thought maybe still worth a second trip.\n\nTrip #2 they first tried to seat us right in front of the guitar player.  Asked to move upstairs, and still way loud.  Ordered the same fried ravioli app - way overcooked and disappointing.  This time I ordered the Shepherd's Pie, marked as one of their specialties and they are all a pub after all.  Wrong.  Big mistake.  Horrible.  Their Shepherd's Pie is a base of browned meat with something red speckled in (maybe pimentos?), with a huge slab or potatoes that were not creamy, not hot, and not flavorful.  And a HUGE slab.  Beside that there was obviously microwaved broccoli still way chunky and microwaved baby carrots... both absolutely plain except for a brown canned gravy poured over everything.  Gross.  I ate like three bites and lost my appetite and shoved aside.  When the waitress asked if I wanted a box and I said no.... you'd think she'd inquire, right?  No, she did not.\n\nHubby had a burger that was good, but in his words Five Guys a few storefronts up is better.  His steak fries were also good.\n\nWe don't drink beer, and this is clearly a sports and beer lovers place.  We tried, twice, and are done.  No, thank you.",

  "text": "I have found my one-stop for all breakfasts happiness destination! I'll run here if ever a zombie apocalypse threatens to take away my morning food. You'll find bagels, donuts, and (MmmMmm) you'll find coffee... I'll ignore the sandwiches for now.\n\nFOOD\nWith a word like \"bagel\" in the title, I expected the bagels to blow me away. With around 20 types of bagels-- they are DELICIOUS to eat without additions or toasting, but don't expect to substitute your New York plane tickets for these. I'm a donut fan and these are a hit or miss. If it has thick frosting, the frosting BREAKS APART from the donut in chunks! Noooo! But if the frosting has been glazed on, it was done so with love and partly melts into the donut dough which makes it delicious. \n\nAh coffee--although some types are served a bit small for the price--MmmMmmm. Awesome, many choices. It complements the dough-ness of the food and comes in many forms. A side area allows for self-service. \n\nSERVICE\nThe employees run the place like a corporate business: serious, brisk, unsmiling. The quick service is awesome as well as the acknowledgement upon entry... but it doesn't seem like these guys get buddy-buddy with anybody. I'm assuming they have cult fans--I've seen ALL types of people go here. ALLLLL freakin' types. (That's a good thing)\n\nLOCATION APPEARANCE\nThe store blends into the not-so-pretty plazas of St. Pete's 4th Street. Worn out signs outside, dusty parking lot... stark contrast from the comfiness that seems to radiate nuclear energy from inside. Cool-- at the side you can watch a baker creating the pastries for the store.",

Supposedly this is a side project from the folks at Farmer's Cabinet and you can tell based on the lighting (or lack thereof).  Thank god the hostess led us up the stairs because I couldn't see a damn thing!  But enough of my whining...let's get back to the important stuff.  \n\nThere are 24 taps downstairs and then they keep the 12 local taps at the upstairs bar.  I was pleased with the Engine 1892 Market Stout from Philadelphia Brewing Company, which was a recommendation from the bartender, Rocco.  He clearly knew his beers, but was also able to recommend/successfully make some cocktails for my friends.  He was also very personable.  The food menu looked really good, but it was under the \"coming soon\" section, so I was unsure if it was actually available last night.  I was intrigued by the turnip kimchi that apparently comes on their hot dogs.  I'll definitely be back to try that and will update my Yelp review accordingly.  \n\nTo summarize, a great place for beer aficionados.  And vampires.

  "text": "Atmosphere:  The craziness going on around you in Reading Terminal depends on the day and time of day that you go. It is really convenient that you can sit at the counter and get waited on there.\n\nService:  The staff was upbeat and pleasant.  They were the ones who recommended we sit at the counter, which was a really nice experience.  We didn't feel rushed to get out of our seats.  It was really great that they offer you a sample of the food if you are unsure.\n\nFood:  Overall very good.  I was hoping for a bit more spice and strong flavors, but it seems like it is made marketable for the general population.  Which worked out fine with me because there were seasonings available on the counter to bump up the flavor profile.  I got the etouffee and bread pudding.  The etouffee was good, but the flavor got a little muddled after eating it for a while.  It didn't have the depth of flavor that I was hoping for.  The bread pudding was super delicious!  I would recommend it to anyone needing a sweet fix.  My friend enjoyed her jambalaya.\n\nOverall:  I would certainly come back.  The convenient location, good service, and yummy food are all definite pluses.  I am not sure that it is the best New Orleans place in Philly, but I am happy to partake of the menu again sometime soon.",

It's just so lovely on a nice sunny morning. \n\nCame here on a Saturday with the bf. we ordered a brunch special which came with french toast, scrambled eggs & 2 pieces of bacon. We also ordered the roast beef sandwich. The french toast was delicious! It almost reminded me of the bread pudding. The only problem... it wasn't big enough!!! If I wasn't being conservative I could have eaten that portion of french toast in 2 bites. Not joking. It was good but not sure if it was worth like $7. The roast beef sandwich however was AMAZING! Boar's head never gets old. There was also some kind of chutney in the sandwich which is what made it pretty tasty in my opinion. And the sandwich was only like $6 and came with fruit. \n\nSuch a cute brunch spot. I would absolutely return!",

This Embassy Suites is not like most Embassy Suites as it does not have the center atrium.  The hotel is a standard high rise building.  \n\nBad - Parking at this hotel is a challenge.  They have a small garage and the parking spots are very small with extremely tight turns.  If you want to prevent getting your doors dinged, don't park in the garage.  Also, there is no elevator in the multi-story parking garage.  So plan on dragging your luggage up and down several flights of stairs. \n\nGood - As with all Embassy Suites they put out a good breakfast spread with cooked-to-order eggs, omelettes and pancakes.  Also, the employees at this hotel are very friendly.\n\nIn summary, I find the parking situation to be unacceptable and I will choose a different hotel when returning to Tampa.",

There was a party of 2 seated just before us who managed to eat and leave before our entree even arrived! \nThe house salad is large enough for three people! I had the fried mozzarella which was quite good...as were the onion rings. I had the cheesesteak and fries. Again, not bad at all! The bacon cheeseburger was also very good. Though, the bacon is so thick you could never bite into it on the burger. The bacon of the third person with us was as black as the ace of spades!\nSo, to wrap this up, I wouldn't make a special trip again for dinner because of the slowness.

Flavor was nice but it was served icy cold, so the true  flavor could not come through.  The compotes served with the pate were wonderful, a great compliment.  Our entrees were the Steak and Frites and the Braised Lamb with Fresh Herbed Pasta.  The steak was perfectly cooked and well seasoned, the fries were limp and greasy.  The herbed pasta dish was interesting but there were only two tiny pieces of lamb, must have been less than 2 oz of meat in this dish.

It's a friendly place and the crowd is always un-stuffy and everyone is having a good time.  They've got a fantastic outdoor area, and the staff is generally pretty pleasant. \n\nThe kickers:  This was my long-time local go-to.  I used to frequent at least a couple times a week hitting happy hour during the week,  and brunch or drinks over the weekend with friends, to the point this place has been known as my \"cheers\".  However,  I'm not sure if it's new management or what,  but over the past year or two,  the service has gone down hill. WAAAAY downhill.   You'll sometimes for for 20\"+ before anyone even approaches you for an order,  and even sitting or standing at the bar,  the bartenders have become pros at standing with their back to the bar and not paying attention or getting your order for at least 5-10\".  The food is still good,  but they used to NAIL IT every time on the burger however you ordered it.  The last several times,  everyone got WELL done,  regardless of order.  \n\nI still go here,  and keep hoping every time that the service quality will return,  but unfortunately the area has exploded so it's always busy,  and I think they just no longer give a rip since they pack the place no matter how crappy service and wait times and food consistency gets. \n\nLuckily,  with the area booming,  there are several other great places now rights across the street and down just a couple blocks. \n\nSummary:  If you're lucky enough to hit this place when it's dead,  don't miss it. If it's slammed,  you're better off across the street at Beer Pale if service matters to you.",

I really liked the ambiance and feel in the bar area and a small seating area connecting to the main dining area. For some reason, I wasn't feeling it in the main dining area (where we sat). I guess that's the idea and maybe we should have asked to sit in a different area. Part of it may have to do with the fact that we were the youngest people in the place by about 40 years. We could hear the commotion in the kitchen, which was weird because it didn't seem like we were that close to it. Next time I would request to be seated elsewhere.\nService-\nOur waitress was alright, she just seemed a little out of place. She broke a dish on the floor, and overall was a bit sloppy. She was nice enough though, and checked on us an adequate amount. \nFood- \nI loved the fact that there was the option to order petite serving, which upon arrival to our table seemed laughable. But once I started eating, it was the perfect amount of food! I ordered the Cedar Plank Salmon and my husband ordered the Crab Cakes. My salmon was delicious and crab cakes decent. However, our sides were just OK. Also my husband's salad seemed straight out of a bag. We were pleasantly surprised at the end of the meal when our server brought us 2 mini chocolate fudge cookies. Mmmmm! The perfect end to the meal!\n\nI might try this place again for drinks/appetizers or I could see a mother's day brunch here, but overall our dining experience wasn't that memorable. Maybe we will give it another try, because I really want to like this place!",

  "text": "An upscale mexican joint? Really?! I enjoy good authentic mexican food, this is by far the most upscale Ive seen.  Im more of the food trucks and hole in the walls type, so this was different than what Im used to. \n\nThe atmosphere at Besito is tough to beat. They have Merengue & Salsa on the background which doesn't really go with the Mexican theme but who's paying attention. An ideal Date night atmosphere for sure. \n\nFood was very good but I must say a bit on the pricey side, you have to consider the fact that you are paying for more than a meal... You have the valet outside, truly great service, our waiter was friendly and happy to discuss the menu, he more than met our expectations. \n\nGuess if you and your date love Mexican food, and feel like taking it to another level for once, Besito is your place. It's a gourmet mexican restaurant, certainly worth trying.",

  "text": "This place is OVERRATED. Been twice now and I felt a review was necessary. \n\nPros: Birra Morretti on tap, sexy menu, chic decor, good service, octopus appetizer, squid ink pasta\n\nCons: Carpaccio is one of my favorite foods and this was not very good at all (no crostini, horseradish or arugula for one thing...and I don't know where the \"Italian kimchi\" was but of that is a play on words regarding the roasted capers then I'm not sure I follow their line of thinking -- kimchi is fermented cabbage after all), sticks on sticks on sticks of butter is used in preparation of the Carbonara which totally drowned out the taste of the guanciale and I didn't see the value at all in adding corn to the dish, Brussels sprouts are just okay but what's worse is that you smell like them for 2 days (I didn't even eat them the second time around and I still smell them today!), mushroom/fontina/truffle pizza and the Quattro formaggi/pancetta were too rich for my blood. This seemed to be the theme: too much burro. \n\nIf I go back, I will be getting Chicken Piccata because it's a great dish and very difficult to mess up. Something tells me though that it will be a little buttery...",

We had the shrimp cocktail and smoked salmon as the first course, both very good. For the second course, had the farm egg frittata and the fried flounder sandwich, which were good. The third course of lemon meringue tart and toasted banana marshmallow was excellent. If you like marshmallows, the toasted banana marshmallow is a must-have. Flawless service, one of the best I have seen.",

Fresh salads, soups sandwiches and Mac and cheese! \n\nMy shrimp and avocado salad was huge and made with lemon basil vinaigrette. The salad was fresh and the shrimp was perfectly cooked. I had to get a take home container it was so big! \n\nThe Mac and cheese was impressive. I got the 5 cheese. The béchamel was a nice creamy, consistency. The top had a nice brown crust. I especially like that it wasn't topped with bread crumbs, but instead topped with a bit of cheddar. It may not be better than my homemade Mac and cheese, but it was good!\n\nI tried my son's tomato basil soup and it was delish! What a great presentation! I think there was a little creme fraiche on top for garnish.\n\nI can't wait to come back and try more of the menu!",

Not in the mood for pizza from Delosa's? Just realized that you paid for parking and that Walt'z has closed for the day - plus your feet hurt from a day at the beach ... stop for a while at Sculley's and take what they serve you. If you can find a server, that is. \n\nActually, the service isn't that bad ... the problem is with the layout of the place. The shops here want to have an eclectic air, as though they were built from driftwood and shipping crates held together with sail cloth and rope. This is fine in fantasy, but in reality does not make it easy for the wait staff to get around easily of remain within eye sight of their tables. \n\nThe food is passable, but unexceptional. Being a stone throw away from Gulf of Mexico means that a restaurant can lean towards basic tourist fare (they likely won't know how boring it is) and get away with it. Locals tend to shy away from such places, unless they are entertaining out-of-townees who believe boat drinks and breezes are more important than fine dining.",

I would normally give it 4 stars, but considering where it is, I think it deserves an extra star. Normally, holiday Inn restaurants are terrible places, and I avoid them, but it was late, and we were exhausted, so we gave it a chance. Bossman got the porkchop that was about 4 inches thick (no kidding) and I got the bourbon chicken. Both were excellent, and the pork wasn't tough, which was surprising Considering how big those chops were. \n\nA few things about Alton:\n\nEast Alton is a rusty old industry town, a place in its hay day made some awesome stuff. They still have Winchester making ammunition their and Olin Brass cranking out precision copper and brass alloys. unfortunately, my reason to go  there was to decommission some research equipment at the olin Brass Metals research Lab. Yeah, the bean counters shut down the research department. Stupid. I wonder what the heck is going to keep this country going in the future. \n\nAlso, Alton was home to the worlds tallest man.",

The food is pretty good (appetizers somehow always being the highlight), but it is always SUPER crowded. Like, constantly apologizing to your neighbors for knocking elbows crowded. The tables are very close so that they can fit everyone. This also makes it difficult to carry a conversation\n\nBut the main reason for only 2 stars is the SERVICE! I've come here for lunch about a dozen times and they always push the buffet, which I understand, but they are VISIBLY annoyed when you don't want it. It's so rude! Last time I came here it was with 8 people, and the hostess asked if we were getting the buffet. I told her I didn't think any of us would, so if we could please get menus. Her face immediately changed, she said \"oh...\", and handed me 3 menus...for 8 people. When the waiter came we apologetically asked if we could have some more, and he pretty much had the same reaction! He rolled his eyes while turning to get more, and just dumped them on the table.\n\nSomething similar to this has seriously happened almost every other time! I get that the buffet is easier for them, but come on! It's not asking for anything crazy, just MENUS! At least make an effort to hide it until you get into the kitchen...",

  "text": "What a fantabulous date night with my favorite hometown chica at Il Giardino :-)  I was stoked about trying out this Italian restaurant for a while now because I had not yet been completely satisfied with my meal at any of the other Italian restaurants (chain or not) I've been to...and Il Giardino seemed like the hidden gem of Springhouse as it is tucked away in one of many shopping centers on that side of Bethlehem Pike.\n\nLike Bacco, Il Giardino specializes in pizza (actually, I have yet to try Bacco's pizza, so stay tuned!), so it was time for the ultimate test:  how does its white pizza play out?  Was I setting myself up for utter disappointment, or was I going to be enlightened?  White pizza is not exactly the most complicated-looking pizza around, but I only know of one other place that makes a few versions of it spectacularly (Top Tomato in Philly!!!).  \n\nAs serendipity would have it,  I received two pizzas on this date night: one which I had ordered (prochuitto gourmet pizza) and the other that was free (Il Giardino white gourmet pizza) because the free one was apparently sent to my table by accident -- yay!!!  It was a wonderful surprise, because the pizza was fantastic.  The white pizza that eventually came out for me was also very delicious and is definitely in my top 3.  \n\nThe atmosphere, I must add, feels intimate not just because it was small (I would say that it's 1/10 the size of The Olive Garden) but because on this Thursday date night, there were people who were enjoying themselves around their respective dinner tables like families, even if they really weren't in the same family.",

  "text": "Famoso Neapolitan Pizzeria is one of the places I go to on a regular basis for a good pizza that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.  Why is pizza so expensive in Edmonton? Is it because cheese is expensive in Canada?  As far as pizzas, I have ordered the Margherita, Abruzzo, Vesuvio, Siciliana, and Moo Shu BBQ Duck.  The pizza that I order the most often is the Abruzzo and the pizza that I found the most disappointing was the Moo Shu BBQ Duck.  The time I ordered it, I found the flavor profile of the whole okay, but the execution was poor.  The duck was overly oily and the hoisin sauce overwhelming.  The one time that we ordered the Caprese Salad, the cheese texture was soggy and lacking flavor.  We found that this preparation of the salad was inedible.  The manager came to the table to explain the \"artisan\" cheese and how it is sometimes not created in a consistent quality.  He removed the salad from our bill and kindly offered us a complimentary dessert which we declined. We made sure to give a generous tip to staff since the service was great regardless of the salad.",

  "text": "THE GOOD: great food for a decent price.  We got the $65 oyster platter which came with 12 huge and succulent oysters, about a dozen each of clams and mussels, 10-12 tails of jumbo shrimp, about half of a huge king crab, 2 small sauce cups of ceviche, and 3 different sauces including a malt vinegar, cocktail sauce, and a spicy mayonnaise dipping sauce, as well as multiple wedges of lemon.  The platter was huge and probably could have fed 3-4 people, though I was able to eat most of it with some help from the fiancee.  The oysters were fresh and delicious and were the star of the platter, while the crab was the not seasoned and somewhat bland compared to the rest of the platter.  Of note, I liked the shrimp as they were steamed with a spicy cajun seasoning which was a nice Louisiana touch.\n\nWe also ordered the fried oyster, bacon, romaine lettuce, and avocado salad which was decent.  The fried oysters on the salad were perfectly prepared, though the bacon was thick cut and a bit on the tough/chewy side (i prefer bacon in a salad to be crispy).\n\nTHE BAD: Service was horrible.  I think we got the worst server in the restaurant; here's the breakdown: His appearance--his long hair made me think he should have been in an 80's hair metal band instead of serving in a moderately upscale seafood restaurant.  His service--inattentive: 1. he never introduced himself before taking our order, 2. he didn't allow us to finish our order as after we ordered our oyster platter he took our menus and walked away and I had to get another waiter/server to order a salad that we wanted to come with our oyster platter, 3.  He forgot our bread, and we didn't realize we were supposed to get bread until halfway through our meal when we saw other tables getting bread, 4. We asked him for lemon with our water and he forgot after multiple queries, and we actually asked 3 different waiter/waitresses/servers for lemon and they all forgot, though our main waiter eventually remembered and brought the lemon to us in the middle of our meal.  The final straw in this terrible haystack was his apathy and rude demeanor at the end of our meal--after taking my credit card and charging for the meal, he walked by our table and threw the credit card/receipt pad so that it plopped on our table and said \"here you go\" and continued walking away like he didn't care.  Overall, it seemed like he did not really care for his job and was there just going through the motions.  I was surprised that a restaurant of Luke's stature hired a waiter like this, as with an appropriate waiter and appropriate service, this meal would have been phenomenal.  Unfortuntely, the service left us in a sour mood despite the quality of the food.  If the service would have matched the food, Luke would have deserved a 4 or 5 stars in my mind, but because of the poor service we received, I gave the restaurant 2/5 stars.",

I like that this place can accommodate large families or birthday parties like for kiddos, but they also have a bar in the back. There are TVs all around playing different games which is also nice. There is a tiny arcade in the back too. We shall definitely be back!",

  "text": "Love the fact that you can access this place through the mall and it's garage. The interior looks more or less like an old library... takes us old folks back to our college days... nicely done... floating bookshelf over the bar... \n\nI wasn't overly impressed with the cocktail choices, I've been so spoiled lately from the vast collection of craft cocktails around town, so I just stuck to water. \n\nAs I generally do drag my meet-up group with me, we had a table of 14 and this poor kid had to take care of all of us by himself. He got a little help when the main dishes came out, but other than that he was on his own. They even seated another table in his section. They knew we were coming, so I would say understaffed. Our waiter tried his hardest and he ran all night, but service could have been better had he gotten a bit more help or at least not be seated more tables. \n\nAnyway, let's get to the food. We often share dishes, so I had quite a few samples and here is my verdict:\n\nBeer cheese tater tots: absolutely delicious, big portion, must have for any tater, cheese and/or bacon fan.. it hits all those areas.\n\nFried cauliflower: fantastic dish, also quite a portion, delicately breaded cauliflower fried to a crisp, tender but not mushy inside and served with an interesting ranch sauce.\n\nFried avocado: I was suspicious I must admit, but it turned out nice... not as big a portion as the other dishes, but nicely done. Coated avocados, deep fried, nice outer crunch, creamy middle, served with a grilled lime and a special ranch sauce... trickle some lime juice on the avocado and dip it in the ranch... omg good.\n\nShishito peppers: guess that's the new fad...basically roasted peppers... not as exciting as it may sound. The little sesame dip that came with it brought  most of the flavor for this dish. Lots of peppers though. \n\nChilaquilles: seemed to be a nacho type creation with lots of chicken and cheese. Not bad, but I wouldn't go out of my for this dish, somewhat bland. big portion though.\n\nFrench Fries: not worth it\n\nTater Tots: absolutely delicious\n\nOnion rings: meh\n\nCucumber tomato salad: wonderful, large portion, nice vinaigrette, not overpowering, wonderfully light fresh salad. highly recommend giving it a try. \n\nMac and cheese: good stuff\n\nDoctorate burger: overrated and deemed not worthy of the price tag.\n\nDouble Major: good, but in my opinion was overdone and a bit dry.\n\nFrench burger: a very drippy cheesy affair, nicely done though.\n\nOverall I would say it's an ok burger spot. On the pricey side, but good for an occasional outing. I probably would just eat all the apps and sides because they were well worth it.",

  "text": "The Blind Tiger is tucked in near some antique shops in Ybor City, unassuming to the eye walking by it save its awesome sign (of a blind tiger, of course) painted on the window. The interior is warm and inviting and the focus is on coffee, tea, and fresh baked goods with some clothing and homewares also for sale. What really impressed me however was that there is as much emphasis on the tea as the coffee: too often at coffeehouses tea is simply an afterthought and nothing more. Not here. There are about six selections of tea and they roughly cover the gamut of black, oolong, and green teas you'd hope to find. The coffee I had was very good and the baked goods include such favorites as banana bread, cakes, and cinnamon rolls--the latter apparently being what Blind Tiger is most known for locally. \n\nOverall it's a very neat little place and the interior is one which makes you feel no expense was spared to create a haven from the loudness and bustle of Ybor City, where it seems every other business is a bar or club. As much as I love bars, it's great to have a place that provides a degree of quiet and serenity.",

  "text": "A tour guide perfectly described the difference between Bourbon Street and Frenchman Street. Bourbon Street is for drunks, drag queens, and prostitutes. Frenchman Street is where the music is. I highly recommend Three Muses, which is a gastropub on the street. The food is incredible. The mac and cheese is amazing. The cheese it uses is great and the dish comes out sizzling hot. Once I started eating it, I could not stop till I finished it. I have the dish ranked as good as any mac and cheese I have tried. It is in a tie with Beechers (locations in New York and Seattle). The pork belly and \"Banh mi\" Gulf Fish Tacos are excellent. The lamb sliders and sweet potato gnocchi with Louisiana crab are very good too.\n\nOf course, Three Muses also has live jazz performances. The music is fantastic. I arrived at the gastropub ten minutes before it opened so I could get a seat at the bar immediately. It was a Sunday night and it still got busy for dinner in a hurry.\n\nIf you are visiting New Orleans and looking for recommendations, feel free to message me through Yelp and I can share my itinerary, which includes my Yelp reviews. The information for an electronic copy can also be found via my Yelp profile.",

  "text": "I've been here a handful of times, and bagels have always been delicious. I visited the shop on 5/19/18, and this will be my last visit. I went there because I was hungry and in need of food, but it seemed like I walked into the middle of classic P.T. Barnum show: clowns juggling while riding unicycles and elephants parading around on their hind legs. The first employee I interacted with, at the \"bulk\" bagel counter, didn't hesitate to let me know that I was attempting to order from the wrong location. Fair enough. They did have a sign on the counter, but it wasn't as conspicuous as an \"order here\" sign that dangles from the ceiling. Her tone made it clear to me that I had already committed one transgression. I then order from the attendant at the POS. I clarified my complicated order of a breakfast sandwich and two toasted everything bagels with a tomato and garlic cream cheese, three times. The first clarification was that I wanted everything bagels, not plain. The second  clarification was directed toward me because they actually have garlic and herb cream cheese, not garlic cream cheese. The third was my reiteration of the tomato and the quantity of the said bagels. At this point I had more confidence in a drunk ESL Uber driver getting me home safely than my order being prepared as per my request. After waiting for my extravagant order to be prepared to imperfection and gazing at the yellow ceiling grid with stalactites of black dust, my name was called and the first employee I interacted with hastily handed me my bagel bag. On the ride home I asked my partner in crime to ensure that there were 3 bagels in the bag because they probably \"F-ed\" the order up. He assured me that the quantity was correct. When I got home, I feverishly ripped open the wrapping on the two everything bagels, like a joyous child on Christmas Day, only to find     that the bagels had the tomatoes omitted and the cream cheese barely exceeded a skim coat. The breakfast sandwich was anemic at best with barely any protein on it. I am so glad that I expected disappointment. Honestly I'm not too upset because closer to my house there is a new bagel shop: Red House bagels, where the staff is courteous, the shop is cleaner, and the bagels a bit larger. Red House is my new bagel stop.  Sorry Newtown Bagel Co, you've been replaced. Although your actual bagels are slightly better tasting, it is not enough to reconcile the pain points associated with your operations. My words of advice, replace (don't clean) your ceiling tiles and clean the filth from the grid. Having almost 10 years of food and beverage experience, I would hate to see what your walk-in and floors behind the counter look like. Coach your employees on courteous service, or maybe treat them better and they might pass that on to your patrons. Oh and maybe write the orders down before entering them into the POS, because sometimes those machines aren't as navigable for some operators. I'd like to keep going on about this, but I am probably beating an already abused P.T. Barnum animal.",

Their new location at Camino Real marketplace is great too,  although the older one at Old Town was more classic.  \n\nThe reason I gave 3 stars instead of a 4.5 or 5 was because of a few ridiculous rules they have.  First,  they regularly email discount coupons but want them to be printed in order to avail the discounts.  I find this very silly.  The name of the restaurant is Natural Cafe and they have messages all over the place to protect the environment.  But it's strange that they need a paper printout and don't allow if we show them the email in the phone. \n\nSecond,  they are also very strict with timings.  If you come around the closing time (9 PM), they just keep showing at the table to get you out.  The older place at Old Town was more relaxed with the timings. \n\nI would have given a higher rating of not for these absurd rules.  The food here is still one of the best.",

  "text": "Food is great, drinks are great, deals are great (Brunch with 2-4-1 drinks? Heck yeah!). The menu is extensive and interesting, with unique twists on classic dishes. The service is also great, but I am withholding a fifth star due to the management's seating policies.\n\nWe came for brunch on a Sunday expecting an hour plus wait, so when the hostess informed us it would be 1hr45m we weren't surprised. However, we became frustrated when we noticed there were 4 open tables on the patio that still hadn't been seated after an hour of waiting. It was a beautiful day so we asked the hostess about it and she said that the tables were reserved. When we asked again, she explained that the patio tables were not assigned to a specific server but were instead added on to a server's load inside, so they weren't seating them because they didn't want to overwhelm the servers. Totally understandable to not want to overwork your servers, but why not seat people with the caveat that service will be slower? Or better yet, why not specifically assign a server to the outdoor section so that wait times will be lower? Having worked in the service industry, our group was confused by this. We ended up just sitting at one of the empty patio tables until the hostess notified us that a table was ready. \n\nWe ordered the Cheddar Biscuit, the Wood Fire Double Yokes, and a Turkey Feta Omelette from the specials board and all were delicious. The biscuit comes in a trio and though it doesn't look like a lot of food they are VERY filling. Our server surprised us with a side of White Trash Hash on the house because our food was taking longer than expected (we didn't even notice the timing, so it was a very nice gesture). The White Trash Hash is a must, this stuff is addicting! Potatoes, rice, and gooey cheese- who could ask for more.\n\nOverall, great place for brunch in Nashville. Expect a long line but food worth the wait. Hopefully management can improve their seating policies to cut down on wait times in the future.",

  "text": "My expectations were fairly high for this place and ultimately I left somewhat disappointed (and $200 less in my wallet). What you are really paying for is the view here. While we didn't lay down a $200 deposit to guarantee a window seat, we did get one. I think this was because we ate so early on a Sat evening (5:30pm reservations). We were seated on the West side and the sun was setting. Fortunately I had my sunglasses with me although they did offer to pull down the shades for me as well. The views were definitely lovely but it likely would have been better had we gone later in the evening when the lights of the city were coming alive. \n\nService was excellent throughout the entire meal. Our waitress took good care of my wife who is gluten free. We asked her what a few of the roads/bridges were that we were looking at, but she sort of guessed at it. You would thinking working there they would be required to know the more major landmarks out there. Oh well.\n\nAs for the food, that's what left me disappointed. I started with the Steakhouse Salad. I guess I just assumed there would be some meat in it, but sadly, there was none to be found. There were quite a few olives in there and unfortunately I'm not an olive fan, so ultimately I wasn't able to finish the salad. My wife's roasted shrimp though wasn't bad. For our entrees, she went with the Salmon while I had the Filet and Shortrib Duo. In the end, it was pretty good but it certainly didn't wow me or anything. I've had better meals and other restaurants in the city. At least the evening ended on a more positive note with dessert. My Lemon Tart was delicious and you can tell they have a pastry chef on site. Not many gluten free options for my wife, so she just had sorbet.",

The tortilla soup that I ordered was piping hot which is HUGE, as it seems like there is an epidemic going around of lukewarm/underheated food. While I waited for it to cool, I sampled the garden salad that my dining companion ordered. For a side salad, the portion was generous. The balsamic vinaigrette was tasty and an elevated alternative to the usual oil and vinegar dressing. The coffee drinks looked inventive as well. For add ons, I recommend the Billy Goat Chips. One also can't go wrong with one of the chocolate-chip cookies (all of the baked goods and desserts are made in house).",

  "text": "This was a fun place to visit for a light dinner and some great entertainment with the kiddies! We caught a band called Washboard Rodeo, and they played some fun bluegrassy-type western swing. We'd made a 7:30 reservation via Open Table and were seated immediately. It's a small place, so any table you get is a good one. This is one of the few places on Frenchman Street that seems okay for children: mine are 9 and 11 and very capable of behaving well in a gastropub setting. The menu has a great baked mac & cheese and the waitresses are warm and welcoming. I have to say, after sampling the fish tacos, I sorta wish that I had ordered the mac & cheese, too! The tacos were okay but small and pretty bland. The mac & cheese was plentiful and well-seasoned. But this place is all about the music and the drinks, and on these they won me over. Had a simple Stella Artois apple cider (despite the great drink selection) and hubby enjoyed his porter. If you make a reservation, they give you 90 minutes to dine, which to me was more than enough. The band starts at 7pm on a weeknight, taking a 15-minute break around 8pm, and our 7:30 reservation gave us plenty of time to enjoy the music. If you visit New Orleans with older kiddies, I'd say give this place a go.",

  "text": "During the 80s as a child my family used to go to Micha's fairly often. Once I was on my own I didn't return for any particular reason. I always liked it and remember the food being very good with a decent atmosphere too. \n\nAfter a very long hiatus, I decided on whim to return with my own family. The atmosphere was still good, although the place was slightly worn around the edges in a good way. That's to be expected after almost a quarter of a century. It's a casual family place, not a fine dining establishment.\n\nThe food was still very good, maybe not quite up to par with what I remembered, but I don't know if that is just an artifact of memory or actual reality. We were served with only one bowl of tortilla chips with no refills offered. I don't know if refills cost extra, or if it was just laxness on our server's part. The chips were fresh and decent, but some weren't warm. The salsa was very good. I ordered the #17 combination plate, in which I had a red chili chimichanga along with refried beans and rice. The red chili had tender cubes of beef in a savory red chili sauce. At some Mexican restaurants the red chili sauce has a somewhat bland taste marred with a texture that is too thick presumably due to too much flour as a thickening agent. Not a Micha's as the sauce had just the right amount of thickness. Going overboard with red chili sauce, I ordered my chimi enchilada style, and it was very good and covered with melted cheddar cheese. The chimi itself was perfectly crisp on the outside with more of a non-fried flour tortilla texture on the inside, which is good but slightly different than the usual chimichangas in the area as they are more crispy throughout the tortilla wrapping. The refried bean were very flavorful and covered with melted cheese also. The rice was tasty, but it lukewarm and had a few cold clumps in it, so I would only say it was only fair. My wife had a carne asada burrito. It was good, but it was pretty dry and lacked the amount of onions and tomatoes that other places typically have. To counteract the dryness she ordered a side of guacamole, which also was a little atypical. The guacamole had a lot of onions, but the unusual part was that it also had some cottage cheese mixed in. Unusual, but good. One of my sons got a bean chimichanga, which was like mine in that it was crispy on the outside, but less so than other places on the inside. He liked it a lot. My other son ordered a machaca taco, chicken enchilada and rice. His plate looked good, and he said it was great. \n\nThe service was good but not great. Our server was for the most part all business and not overly friendly. The bus boy was very friendly, however.\n\nI would go back again. My kids loved it, and I thought it was good, but my wife was only partially impressed. So it won't be a place that we would frequent with any regularity, but I wouldn't hesitate to go again",

  "text": "I was all too underwhelmed by Pre and Pastry. My amazing fiancée and I went there for breakfast one day with high expectations! I love a good breakfast and am a picky eater. I understand that not everywhere has something I love, but I remained hopeful!\nThe inside is darling and has a promising ambiance. We were sat at a tiny table that was incredible unstable. Once we had our waters and coffee the table was nearly full and very shakey. Our server was an awkward girl who wouldn't look us in the eyes. \nI ordered the sweet potato hash with no eggs and my fiancée had duck fat gravy with biscuits. My meal had little to no flavor and I ended up using tobasco to make it resemble tasting like something. My Fiancée said his meal had no flavor and was greasey. \nMaybe if we ordered differently, we could really like the place, but we are turned off by it now. If you go, do not get the sweet potato hash!",

It was below par. Stay away from the biryani or head nxt door to biryani king. Apart from the the meal was wonderful and i'll cm back again.",

He had been before and gotten the pork belly bánh mì but this was my first time.\n\nWe split an order of the fried egg rolls + each got a bánh mì. The soups looked tempting but the bowls were so big! He got another pork belly bánh mì and I got the grilled pork. Since the sandwiches were cut in half we shared those too so each of us could have both flavors. We liked them both but agreed the grilled pork, which does have a brown sauce of some sort, was better.\n\nAfterward I wanted something sweet so I ordered a strawberry smoothie to go. I asked for *some* bubbles because i wanted to try them but didn't want my drink full of them. Overall it was good but SUCH a sugar bomb.\n\nThe guy running the place was very nice, too. I asked him to explain what the condiments were on the table because they were labeled in Vietnamese, and of course he did. We didn't use fish sauce or hot sauce or vinegar but it's nice to know they're available.",

Well if the smell of dirty dish water didn't turn me off the noise of the kitchen sure did. We were given a table right in front of it. Beyond that I ordered eggs Benedict which was less than spectacular for $10 and my wife got the small something and it had some potatoes, 2 eggs scrambled and a muffin that also cost $10. When you add this all on top of the fact that we had to scream at each other to have a conversation and that the a/c was dripping on our table it didn't make for a great experience.",

We were greeted by very friendly staff, and quickly seated on the patio overlooking the beautiful homes in the neighborhood. I was glad to see that their menu had a very nice selection of different foods. I ended up with the \"Jewish coonass,\" which was absolutely AMAZING. The dish consisted of two potato latkes piled high with crawfish etoufee, each topped with a fried egg. I am craving it now!!!  My partner had the stuffed bell pepper and it was amazing as well. Very good prices, and also a good selection of craft cocktails as well. The next time we are in New Orleans (which I hope is soon) we will definitely be here again!!!",

I imagine that you have to make reservations relatively early given the size of the place and popularity though.\n\nOrdered the Greek coffee for myself which was tiny (not sure if that's how it's supposed to be) but still tasty and unique with the coffee grounds in the cup. My friend ordered the Greek frappe which was creamy and delicious, will definitely get that next time. Got the Shakshouka which smelled amazing and was hearty and rich, especially since I opted for the additional sausage. Was pleasantly surprised by the peppery spiciness. My friend got the Cypress Breakfast which she said was delicious as well.

Our normal visit consist of overindulgence on appetizers. \n\nThe pretzel bites are amazing. Same thing with the grilled brie, apple and honey sandwich (we ditch the bacon...I know, sacrelidge!). But the star of the show is always the fries. We usually get the Smack fries which are outstanding. Also a fan of the fried pickles. \n\nMisses so far have been the veggie quesadilla (bland and ordinary) and the spinach artichoke dip (pasty and again rather plain). \n\nTheir beer and drink selections are wonderful. \n\nOnly negatives in two visits is the sometimes slow staff (even when not busy) and old ass dilapidated parking lot.",

When I think of eating at Anthony's, I start salivating.\n\nThey have an outdoor area with an indoor/outdoor bar separating the patio from the restaurant. \n\nMy go-to order at Anthony's Coal Fired is a large Proscuitto and Onion pizza with the proscuitto baked (they can either top the pizza with after it's cooked or bake the proscuitto with the rest of the pizza). The saltiness of the procsuitto mixed with the fresh parmesan cheese and sautéed onions is the perfect combination. We split this between two people and always have a slice or two left over for breakfast the next day. If we only have one slice leftover, watch out.. it's a race to see who gets the last piece first!\n\nLet's talk about the baked wings.... really, really, really good. I actually didn't get them for the first time last night and the first thing my boyfriend said to me was \"no wings?\". The wings are baked in the coal oven and have a great charcoal taste to them. They serve them with onions and focaccia bread which are equally as delicious.\n\nAside from the food being down right delicious, the service is always excellent for take out, dine in, or even if you're just sitting at the bar.",

Other ingredients were perfect. Easily two meals, their sandwiches are quite large, thank goodness since I thought almost $10 was a bit pricey. Place was packed for lunch but staff remained calm & friendly as they went about their business. Took mine to-go and it was packaged well ( in butcher paper ) and was still warm and not soggy when I got home. Will go again, with hubby next time since I think he'll enjoy their food.",

Both were fresh, delicious, and hit the spot.  I wish we'd sampled some of the truffles but just didn't have room.",

For one reason and one reason alone:  olive tapenade.  Yes, I am secure enough in my own sexuality to say \"Olive Tapenade.\"  That stuff just keeps me coming back every time.  \nI really can't top Aimee K's review - I have tried and liked all of the food dishes she mentioned.  The baked goat cheese is one of my favorite dishes ever.  Anywhere.  So good.  I know they also have half price wine night on Wednesday's (I think)... another reason to go visit this gem of a secret on the Hill.  They always have very unique specialty cocktails and sangrias.  \nThis is a great date spot or a spot to go eat with friends.",

The server was not as attentive as I would have liked and I had to ask for water several times. But the hostess/manager was very friendly and chatted with us for a bit. The pace of the meal was perfect long enough to digest and enjoy between courses.  The setting is beautiful it feels very retro with the old fans, tin roofs, and dark wood. The boudin noir was delicious. Followed by crawfish bisque with stuffed crawfish which taste perfectly seafoody with a hint of spices very subtle layered flavors. The Gumbo was also very good. I had beef short rib were tender but the presentation was a bit weak. The other meals were more of visual masterpieces. The crabmeat omelet was delicious and the home made fries were perfect. The grits were very creamy.and the pan fried trout was fabulous. This a really great place to come to try out John Besh food on without the hefty price tag.",

  "text": "I went here with my aunt last Tuesday for all you can eat crab legs. What an experience!!?! The service was wonderful and the crab legs were the best I've ever eaten! Our server was a young girl and I believe she was training someone so we got extra special attention, which was nice! The salad was fresh and served on frozen plates along with their fresh garlic bread. The crab legs came out fresh and hot and were served with mashed potatoes and an ear of corn. My only complaint is that after the initial order, they only bring out one crab claw at a time when you order more. This was a little disappointing since we were ordering all you can eat and definitely came to eat more than one at a time. The server was accommodating though and let us know that she would put in a new order each time she delivered our new plate so we never had to wait, which was nice. You can tell they don't mass cook the crab legs because they come out hot and steaming each time. The manager came over to check on us twice and ask how our experience was. Overall we had an enjoyable evening and will definitely return!",

And at the end of our dinner, we tried to pay using the little computer that sits on every table. This machine would not accept our payment due to technical issues. The waitress even tried, and the people behind us and across from us had the same issue. The waitress went to get the acting Manager (female with dark hair) who upon having to come out to each table to get our credit cards, huffed and puffed, rolled her eyes, and yanked our credit cards from our hands and headed to the back area to run all payments. She came back and set all bills on each table, rather than hand them to all of us, with no apology, turned and walked away. I can honestly say she does not belong in a people business!

Unfortunate for me the salsa sucked, I do not like chipotle flavored anything. The chips were homemade and fantastic. Had ceviche for an appetizer which was very good. Though couldn't eat it with salsa... Main course I was very excited about a poblano chile relleno, definitely my signature dish to try and this one sounded great with queso fresco spinach mushrooms in a spicy poblano. The poblano was not roasted enough, then the relleno was undercooked, and I'm not a fan of over cooking but this was notably too little. My partner in crime had fish tacos and said they were bland. On a plus, they had Dragoons beer on tap so we didn't have to endure Mexican beer. All in all presentation was good, staff was attentive, food needed more spice and flavor, ditch the chipotle salsa, or offer something else. If they offered a better salsa I would give a 4 star instead of 3.",

It like a corner Bar it's small but nice. This was two weeks ago but I had put it up on Yelp because food was really good and I would go back again. My friend Pat had steak smash potatoes and vegetables said it was good. My wife had a burger and fries and I had shrimp with chicken with mixed vegetables and Francine had crab cakes. And we ordered on side chicken egg rolls the where really good too.",

I definitely had my heart set on the Sweet Tea Chicken Fried Biscuit and was a little bummed to hear they were sold out. However, the little bear plate was simple, yet delicious and paired nicely with a side of savory whey grits. Also, the slow drip coffee is on point .\n\nOverall, Milktooth is a great addition to the Fletcher Place/Fountain Square area. I'm looking forward to spending many weekends at this place.",

And the \"regular\" size is quite generous.  Don't come here if you'd prefer to pay a fortune for a coffee drink with a name you can't pronounce, and then sit at a table to drink it from a paper cup. This place makes you feel welcome to sit and take your time at a table looking out through the large glass front, at the crepe myrtle tree lined sidewalk and little globe lights on the front patio.  It's simply my favorite place in New Orleans to get my coffee zen on. (Oh, and they do great breakfast and lunch panini)",

You guys are lucky that I was starving and it was at least another 2 hours before my plane would even start boarding so one slice and drink set me back about 12 bucks.\n\nThe slice that I got was a combo which had sausage, onions, green peppers, and olives. They throw it in the oven for about a minute or two to heat it up. Not the best pizza but i have also had worse. The end crust was pretty thick almost to the point that it was a breadstick. I asked if I could get some pizza sauce on the side to dip it in and was ready to pay because hay, its the airport where they gouge you on pretty much everything. To my surprise, they didnt charge me. I guess nice workers do exist at airports. Unfortunately, this was the only positive highlight. \n\nOverall, I dont think I will eat at this place again any time soon. I can more than afford to lose a few pounds or 20. Put something with actual garlic on the menu and maybe we can talk about dining here.\n\nYelp 2016 Review #12 \"Vampires dont worry about this place. There's no garlic here\"\n585 overall",

Chris asked that we let him know when we wanted to give the restaurant a second chance, but we decided not to. We didn't want any special attention. We wanted real unreviewed service.  We were seated in the bar because it was a very  busy night, regardless of that the server was very attentive and had a great personality. Our food came out in a timely manner, well prepared and delicious. We have since then been back several times and service continues to remain great.",

  "text": "I made my Yelp account for the soul purpose of reviewing this place; I think that very much speaks to how I enjoyed the experience. It's exactly what you would expect from a local cafe/coffee shop and then some. The food and coffee were great and the atmosphere was very friendly and casual. The architecture of the dining room was very cool as well - it had a very Victorian feel, which I personally love. The service was a bit slow, but the barista was the only person working behind the counter and she was also very personable, so for that we can forgive her. When I go to a coffee shop I usually go to stay and relax, often reading or sketching. It is the perfect place for that, with both indoor and outdoor tables, a booth, and a counter. I also appreciated the dog-friendly policy but that's definitely a personal preference and isn't right for everyone. The location is also great, being situated in the French quarter. My only complaint is that I could only visit once on my trip to New Orleans.",

  "text": "oh Millers, how i wanted to like you.  You are close to my house, have ample parking, and large spacious tables.  you even have a fireplace in the back for a little ambiance. \n\nfriends and i tried to come here 2 or 3 times for a quick/inexpensive* bite to eat and every time there was a 30-60 minute wait. we thought this must mean they are really good.  perhaps it just means that people in Springfield are willing to settle for a less than average dining experience.  *side note- this place is not inexpensive. \n\nhubby and i ordered apps- he got zinger boneless wings, and i got the guacamole. portion size was ENORMOUS on the guac - it could have served 8 people, seriously.  flavor was meh. apparently the wingz were good.  hard to tell what hubby enjoyed more, the wingz or the scantily dressed hostesses. \n\nour server was great, attentive and pleasant.  When something went wrong she did her best to fix it. That was much appreciated.   Side salad came out wilted and gross. management offered to take it off the check, would have rather had a decent salad in the first place but i digress.  Dinner was not very flavorful - at all - and portion sizes were okay. i got the quesadilla appetizer (which was plenty for an entree) but it was very sloppily put together and had no seasoning at all.  I have had food that is presented better and tastes better at fast food restaurants, where i am happy to pay $5 for a meal.  \n\nAt the end of the meal, i badly wanted dessert but didnt want to risk another poorly flavored dish.  Not to mention, all the dishes were like lunch tray plastic, and i felt that a $50-60 dinner for two was at least worth a nicer presentation. who knows, it may have even made up for the bland flavors. \n\nperhaps i was let down by the fact that there always seemed to be a wait and i had over hyped it in my head.  Never have i wanted to send back everything i ordered at a restaurant before this night.  i will never be back.  my husband says he will order the wings, but takeout only. no more dining in at this place.",

  "text": "This place is hip.  Perhaps too hip for many over 35 but if you can tolerate the boisterous and extremely casually attired youth--I haven't worn a suit in 20 years either but even 20 year olds should have something besides skinny jeans and T-shirts with borderline obscene slogans in their closets--the food is worth it and the staff copes well.   \n\nI had a 6:00 reservation (obtained the day before) but the sky seemed threatening a downpour so I came early to avoid it and was seated 20 minutes or so before the appointed time.  I often don't even make reservations and have no trouble getting seated at popular places by being there when they open or, for those open all day, coming before the popular dinner hour, but that didn't work the day before at Lüke.  Even at 4:30 the place was packed so I did make one for the following day.\n\nMy meal started with the crispy Brussel Sprouts.  Even if you hate Brussels sprouts (I like them), don't be afraid to try this dish--if no one told you you might not know what you were eating.  They are in some sort of sweet/sour sauce/dressing and fried both slightly blackened and crispy as advertised . . . tossed with almond slices, small bits of jalapeño and sprinkled with shavings of cheese on top.\n\nThen I had pork schnitzel and \"pommes frites\" (that's shoestring fries to the Galliphobes).  It came with whitish gravy in a pitcher, I suppose to make it \"Southern\".  The gravy was good but I skipped eating it, doing that the usual way with a squeeze of lemon.  It was excellent and the fries were fine too.\n\nI finished with some excellent decaf and a glass of Kahlua--I had had iced tea with the meal so some alcohol was not an excess.\n\nA lady who was some sort of hostess dropped by my table while I was eating to make sure everything was OK and when told I needed ketchup (for the fries), went and got me some (in a dainty little single-serve Heinz bottle).  My waiter also checked several times but didn't hover.\n\nI am giving it 4 stars.  The 5th star is withheld because of the crowded dining room and noise level . . . nothing to do with the food which I greatly enjoyed.",

I'd like to see Refuel be more proactive in preventing this, but I do appreciate the young man who was very friendly and broke up a 4 top table from one of the couples who snaked seats and squeezed the three of us in just as our food arrived.\n\nI will definitely head back to Refuel and I will continue to order BEFORE grabbing a table, and I hope you will too!",

  "text": "Well, well.... Where do I start with this place? First time experience, went in with my partner.\n\nWalking in at about 7:30 on a Friday night (st paddys day weekend even)  and the  place had about 4 customers. That should have been my first clue as to what our experience was going to be like.\n\nWe seated ourselves and the waitress, an older gal maybe mid to late 40's who had greasy stringy unwashed hair and rotting teeth came up and took our drink order. My girlfriend got a Dr. Pepper and I got a water. She brought out Coke instead of DP. No biggie. We let it go, assuming it was an honest mistake. After about 10 minutes she returns and we order a 12 piece \"jumbo\" wing basket ($11.99), a 6 piece($7.99), and a beer batter sampler($11.99). 20 minutes pass and finally here comes our appetizer. The waitress throws the basket of appetizers on the table  and says \"here's your food.\" Very flat with a big attitude and walks off. The beer battered mushrooms were doughy and undercooked. We had a single half full ranch cup to share between us for the big platter and she avoided our table when she saw we needed more.\n***let me note that this waitress is giving the customers at the 3 tables surrounding us WAY better customer service. Even brought their food out in a timely manner with no attitude whatsoever.\nI decide to let the mushrooms slide for the moment. I used to work in a restaurant and I understand that mistakes happen, however this far into the experience I'm being mighty generous since it's a first time experience.\nWe finish our appetizer and we wait and wait and wait and finally she comes by and takes the platter returning 10 minutes later with our wings. She makes no inquiry about the broken open, clearly undercooked, mushrooms still sitting on the platter.\nI got the 12 piece with a single half full ranch. Again. Food on the table, doesn't ask if we need anything else which is something she is doing for other customers. at this point we have been here for about 40 minutes.\n\nI got half regular and half thai flavor. The wings were NOT jumbo. They were puny. The flavor was good for the thai, and the waitress even stopped by to check up on us, though I wouldn't consider walking by quickly and saying in your flat attitude tone \"youguysdoingalright?okaycool.\" Really all that helpful since she came and went so fast it took me a second to understand her. I had to reiterate for my girlfriend.  When I started on the regular I bit into my drumstick and had to fish a feather out of my mouth. DISGUSTING. It was that point that the entire experience was completely and thoroughly unacceptable.  The wings were soggy because they batter them or something on top of all that.  At first I had no plans other than to pay for the meal and leave the waitress 2 pennies and be on my merry way. But when the waitress came and asked if we needed a box I said no with 6 wings still on my plate, OBVIOUS SOMETHING WAS WRONG, again. She was going to take my stuff and make no inquiry to right the situation. I asked for the manager. Took a minute but finally the manager came over (mind you it is still pretty dead, what are these people doing I wonder?) I explained the food issues but blew off bringing up our treatment by the waitress. Normally I give the benefit of the doubt on this one but it was blatantly obvious that we were being treated differently with a different attitude than other patrons because we are a same-sex couple. Like our table had a contagious disease that prevented us from getting food in a timely manner, and getting drink and condiment refills too, regardless of the *empty* cups on the edge of the table. It wasn't like we were off in the distance. She had to walk by our table every time to communicate with the surrounding tables.\n\nAnyways. The manager experience wasn't the greatest, but I wasn't going to pay for that meal after the feather thing, and she comped everything. BUT only after slightly arguing with us about the undercooked mushrooms, which by the way come frozen which  makes the fact that they weren't cooked all the way acceptable I guess? Don't know. Don't care. I WILL NOT BE GOING BACK!!!\n\n2 stars because they did comp the meal, the waitress got lucky. If I would have had to pay for anything she wouldn't have gotten a tip due to the attitude but we left her $4 anyway since we didn't have to pay for the meal.  THAT IS THE ONLY REASON.\n1 star though for the overall experience. Same-sex couples, steer clear. You aren't welcome there and it's obvious.",

We were seated at about 1pm.  Drinks came pretty quickly and the server was very nice.  We ordered a Cheese Steak, Hot Roast Pork and a Rueben all with fries.  After an hour we started asking about our lunches; at one point the servers said that our order was about 1/2 prepared.  Wait. What?  An hour+ for three sandwiches?  They said they were slammed.  We could see three open tables outside and two other tables seated after us had already received food.  Lots of \"I'm sorries\" from the wait staff.  We insisted on a complimentary round of drinks (which they did agree to).\n\nWhen the food finally came, the Roast Pork sandwich and fries were completely cold (guess that was the half that was done on time).  The pork was fine, but the roll just average and the gravy was awful.  Fries, meh.  Cheese Steak filling looked like ground beef and was a miniscule portion in a large grinder roll.  The Rueben looked OK.\n\nWe should have checked reviews before sitting down, but it was getting late and we just wanted to catch a beer and a sandwich.",

The food - delicious, but eliminates itself as a \"sports bar\". My sons and I wanted to catch some pub grub and the hockey game.  Got the game.  The grub-- eclectic.  Do go here if you want a busy, bustling, energetic, tasty, flavorful, thumping music-beat experience.  Don't go here if you want  a burger, a beer and a hockey game amidst sports conversation.",

  "text": "Absolutely amazing!!! My girlfriend and I went on a Wednesday night for Restaurant week and didn't know what to expect but we were overly satisfied. We ordered blood orange margaritas and they were strong and delicious. For our appetizers we had meatballs and let me tell you they weren't your average meatballs. They were veal and beef meatballs that melted in your mouth. Our other appetizer was some sort of grilled cheese that was amazing as well. For our entree we had the fishermen stew that was full of flavor and well balanced. Initially I did not think I was going to like it but it was to die for. Every element of the stew had it's own flavor and it was properly cooked. My girlfriend ordered the steak that came with cauliflower puree and a vegetable medley that was delicious as well. This was the first time we had ever ordered our steak to be medium-well and ever since we've been hooked. The steak was so juicy, tender and seasoned so eloquently and the puree was seasoned beautifully as well. \nThe service there was amazing!! I forget the waitors name but he was great with the menu. He helped us order and came back frequently to check on us. \nOverall I think BARRA is amazing. It's not expensive and it is very intimate.  If you are looking for good food and great service at a reasonable price, BARRA is the place to go!!!!",

NO MATTER WHAT YOU ORSER, IT WILL BE DELICIOSO!\n\nThe quality is second to none, the service is fantastic, the kitchen (open to the public eye) is extremely clean!  Atmosphere is elegantly relaxed and comfortable. Don't let the cloth tanle cloths fool you. You will be as comfortable in shorts or jeans as you wod in a buusiness suit.\n\nMy favorite entrees are (first and foremost) the Gorganzola stuffed shrimp. They are huge and the sauce they drizzle over them is beyond description! Suffice to say my taste bud have a monumental fiesta en la boca ( party in the mouth)! Tip: request extra sauce on the side to dip some shrimp into to coat....yuummm!\n\nThe salmon on a cedar plank is also so awesome.  \nThe Chiles Rellenos are also delicious.\n\nJust notE that they do change up the menu but if there is something you like, just ask. Some things on the lunch menu aren't on the dinner one and vice versa.  They are very accomodating. Soooool if the shrimp aren't on the menu, ask them for it! \n\nWhatever you have you can't go wrong with this place!",

The ambience was calm and relaxing and our server Jay was very kind. We started with the fried shrimp wantons which were great, and our three dishes: curry goat, curry shrimp and curry chicken roti were all flavorful. The roti was so soft! A mild taste for all backgrounds, but they were happy to bring out a side of pepper sauce for my dad who needed a kick. The owner Anthony was kind enough to greet us and explain the meaning behind the name of the restaurant. The peanut punch is a must have. The food was authentic and satisfied my Trinidadian mother! Will be frequent customers!!",

It's all three. \n\nWe stopped by there for lunch today. Someday I'm going to go back and have one of their delicious looking ice cream martinis. Yes, they have liquor in them.  What a great country.  \n\nMike decided on the Cuban Sandwich and I had the Roast Beef Melt. We both chose a small side of the Polish Pickle Soup.  They had other special soups today that also sounded delightful like the beef stroganoff soup.  \n\nPotato soup with dill pickles mixed in. Picklelicious. Mike's Cuban Sandwich was pork, ham and cheese on French bread.  They replaced the traditional sweet pickle on it with dill pickle.   My Roast beef had onions and white cheddar cheese on it and horseradish sauce.  The sauce could have been a little tangier.  The sandwiches were large and easily handled our hunger.  We ended with a world's smallest ice cream cone. YUM. \n\nOf course we will be back.",

  "text": "We visited the Ihop on Canal Street after a day of traveling and were seated by a friendly waitress. In our group, there were two adults and four children, ages 14, 13, 5 and 3. The waitress brought our drinks and took our order quite efficiently. When the food arrived, one five-stack of buttermilk pancakes were missing. My daughter had to sit and watch everyone eat for some time, while the waitress made promises each trip past our table. Knowing she was starving, I finally gave her one f my three pancakes so she had something in front of her while she waited.\n\nFinally, her order arrived and she began eating. The waitress left my bill on the table - $54. I had ordered the Colorado Omelette which was quite good but when I finished most of it and started on my pancakes, I got a nasty nasty surprise. With the second bite of my pancakes, something felt wrong in my mouth. I reached in and found a hair. I started pulling it out of my mouth and it kept coming and coming, like a fishing line!!! UGH MY GAWD. The thing took both hands and turned out to be a curly reddish hair. It was not mine nor the waitresses as it had obviously been cooked into the pancake. This made me sick to my stomach, of course.\n\nI called the waitress over and showed her. She quickly told me the hair did not match anyone on duty (WHO CARES ABOUT THAT? THE DAMN THING WAS IN MY FOOD!) She asked me if I wanted to speak to the manager and I said no, please just take this food away from the table. She did not ask me if I wanted a replacement (even though I would have said no, it would have been nice if she had offered). She came back to the table a few minutes later and picked up the $54 check, leaving another in its place. I thought maybe she had took my meal off of the bill but NO - now my total was $63.89. Listed as a service charge was $7.73 - she had included her own gratuity after the hair was found. \n\nIHOP used to be my ultimate favorite restaurant but now it just makes my stomach churn and brings back a memory I cannot erase. I will never, ever return to this restaurant and unless something changes in the future, I will never eat at another IHOP err... IHAIR again!!!  \n\nAnd since when did IHOP start adding gratuity into their checks?????????????????",

Decor is simple, white wall with 7 frames of challenge winners and 2 laggy TVs.  The service is fine, not as personal, but nothing really to complain.  The food was the biggest difference between the places.  The pho was plain, no complexity, almost like it came from a dry seasoning pack.  They also recommended the chicken vermicelli as one of their best -- it wasn't.  First off, they call it vermicelli but they used pho noodle instead?  What!!?? It was thick, heavy, and full the stomach quick --- everything a vermicelli not suppose to be.  Anyway, we left unsatisfied.",

  "text": "My husband son and I went in for dinner last Friday night. Upon entering we were greeted by a friendly hostess. As we stood there waiting for her to grab the menus I couldn't help but to notice a strong dirty mop water stench. Thankfully when we left the entry way it didn't carry into the dining room. The remodel is impressive looking. We were sat at a booth. Looking over the menu I was surprised at how limited it was. As long as you make what you offer well no biggie. I ordered the mushroom swiss burger and a beer. My husband ordered the \"knuckle sandwich\", ( tri-tip sandwich served French dip style). My son ordered the chicken strips and we all got French fries as our side. Jesse, our server was nice enough but in the loud dining room you couldn't hear a word he said. I was more annoyed that he didn't take the initiative to speak up than about the noise. The beer came out, although tasty it wasn't cold enough at all. The food came out within a reasonable amount of time. My husband's \"Knuckle Sandwich\" was delicious! That is what the two stars are for. My burger was shockingly small and probably the blandest burger I have ever eaten. My son's chicken strips tasted like they floured them...and that was it... also, no hint of seasoning. The fries are your run of the mill freezer to fryer. I hope they step it up and are successful.",

  "text": "Caveat to this review - this is still their \"soft\" opening.\n\nWe decided at the last minute to walk over for dinner and check out the menu before the crowds start coming in.\n\nThey are off to a good start. We were seated at a high-top by the bar, not my favorite spot, but it will do. The interior has not changed at all so it looks cool and urban and hip and classy-casual as usual. \n\nOur meals were very good and the food was all fresh and hot and very nicely presented. I had the Chicken Picatta and the portion was generous. The sauce was pleasantly lemony with capers all placed over a very nice menage of fresh corn and other veggies. There were mashed potatoes on the side. It was flavorful and nicely cooked. The chicken breast was tender and juicy.\n\nThe service was a bit uneven. We were given menus and he took our drink order after pouring the water. There was a bit of a wait getting our drinks. I am not sure what the hold up was, it was not that busy. We asked to have some time to enjoy our drink and look through the menu. Our waiter returned in due time - about 10 - 15 minutes and we said we were ready to order. My husband ordered another wine - and it never came. So we reorder when he came by to ask if we wanted another drink. I am not sure whether he forgot to put in our drink order, of there was a tie-up at the bar.\n\nWe are looking forward to coming back again and trying some of their other dishes and giving a try to their appetizers.",

They weren't playing soul music but they were playing the blues with some jazzy undertones. Nothing worst than a bunch of white boys in jeans that look like they slept in them. It's like an after thought..they just rolled in hit a few licks after laying on the couch all day look.  They knew they had a show! when is dirty looking tees and jeans part of the act? One cat had on a nice shirt  no stage presence at all. \n   I was told is was a classy place..NOT more of a old gentleman's club feel and outdated looking. Had the sushi..gag me. I have had better wont order that again if I return to Daddy Jacks. My guy Aaron at Kroger 79th and fall creek makes it better! it's yummy! He's from Thailand if that helps he is a sushi master.\n  I also tried the buffalo shrimp. Okay I'm thinking these may be what I'm familiar with from my Ann Arbor Michigan experience ..YUCK!  not even close. No batter not even a dusting just 12.50 cent worth of shrimp  thrown in hot sauce. It's beyond laughable..where is the skill in that?  The Corona is always tasty can't mess that up.One thing for certain folks..fool me once that's all you get outta me, I don't fall for it twice when my money is involved.",

  "text": "This Vietnamese restaurant was our last stop before heading home.  We picked up a few sandwiches (banh mi) for $3.50 each.  By the way, it's buy 5 get 1 free.  To our pleasant surprise, this place also serves some popular dishes, such as bun Bo hue (spicy noodle soup), pho, beef stew (bo kho), etc.  We ordered these dishes and they were authentic Vietnamese.   The place was spic and span, including the bathroom.  Since we were there around 11AM and probably were their first customers of the day, we don't know how well the placed is kept clean later during the day.  As for banh mi, we asked for the condiments to kept separate from the sandwiches, as they were not going to be consumed right away.  The folks behind the counter separated each ingredient in its own bag so as to make it easy for us to prepare our sandwiches when we're ready to eat.  Nice touch!!!  The meats for the sandwiches at Seasons Cafe and Bakery were in good quantity, which puts the banh mi shops in Northern VA to shame.  The workers wore gloves when handling foods, and their sanitation practices seem to be better than most typical Vietnamese restaurants we've visited. Wish this restaurant was near us at home in Northern VA.",

The ravioli were definitely homemade, they were a little light on the filling which made them less flavourful then they should have been. Service was great,  the place was so loud the wait staff had a hard time hearing us unless we raised our voice. Good place. Extremely tiny and tables are jammed in. Not recommended for a date night. With so many great places to eat in this neighborhood the only thing that would bring me back is the fact it's bring your own bottle. Otherwise I know I could find something as good or better with less noise, a tad more elbow room, and more flavor",

You do have to order a side separately which kinda sticks but seems to be a trend these days. They take reservations so that's always a plus. If you are looking for additional options besides a burger might not be your best spot to go. I'd like to see them do a lunch special during the week for those that go during the work day. I think it would help with costs and getting a bigger lunch crowd. Overall great experience and service. Check them out!",

I shared it with my father, who took one bite and called it the most destructive thing he ever had. It won't hit your taste buds hards, but internally, it's brutal. The soup that comes on the side was okay, but if you want to kick up the heat, ask for Indian green peppers to put into your dosa.\n\nOtherwise, service is quick, and noise is low. The dosa will fill you up, which definitely makes it worth the price and the drive. Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu.",

The sweet potato fries are skinny fries and are the prettiest, brightest shade of orange I've ever seen! They had a nice texture and good seasoning. \n\nNow, the filet mignon was incredible! It had one of the most amazing textures I've ever experienced in a steak. It also had a very strong pepper flavor that was perfect!

  "text": "First time back to Nashville since I was in high school, and can't believe I haven't been back sooner! Here at Vanderbilt for a class, and kept passing by the Tavern on my way to campus each morning... Had an inticing, rustic, downtown Manhattan look to it. So I put it on my list of places to check out. I looked here in Yelp, and saw it had great reviews. \n\nI came in for dinner tonight, and immediately noticed the reclaimed wood door, wrought iron, and alternative rock playing. I knew it would be a great place. I sat at the bar, as I was here by myself, and immediately got a menu and was offered a drink. I had the 1920, which was a little stout, but better than weak, am I right? I ordered the lamb tacos, Tennessee tavern fries, and cinnamon roll bread pudding. Tacos were small, but honestly a decent portion considering how much meat was on them. They were hot out of the kitchen, and the roasted peanuts gave it great crunch. Now, the Tennessee tavern fries ... Sweet potato fries with a touch of cinnamon and sugar, with jalapeño ketchup. Shut the front door, these were to die for. Light and airy, arrived in a mini frying basket with abundant portions. The ketchup was amazing, and I definitely asked for more. The cinnamon roll bread  pudding was a muffin size portion, with vanilla ice cream, homemade whip, and caramel sauce. Great flavor, not overwhelming. \n\nService was fantastic, and even met some fun people! Highly recommend this place. I'll be coming back for sure.",

I had a small pizza that was a gooey mess (mushrooms and hearty toppings need a thick crust for stability).  I love all the scotch egg offerings (you can get it on a pizza or burger here), but they are so salty.  The burgers are good. The desserts are great (please get the frangipane).

They have a very nice setup, with sections far enough apart so that the restaurant isn't overly loud when the bar is busy. The staff are usually very friendly, and keep your drinks filled. The place has a great atmosphere and can be a good spot to catch a ball game. Some of there specials are tempting, especially when they have half priced starters.\n\nThe food here is about what you would expect. Efficient, hot, served quickly but nothing that will knock your socks off. I'd recommend the burgers and just about any of the fried dishes. Most of the starters are good, especially the wings. The BBQ is passable, but nothing to get excited for. Certainly aren't many good alternatives for BBQ in the area, so this place could definitely do the trick. Just please beware that if you're dining with a large party, your BBQ will likely be a bit on the dry side by the time it comes out, happened on multiple occasions. If you're there with just one or two other people, then you won't have to worry.\n\nBottom line is that if you're staying at the Holiday Inn that this is connected to, you can get a decent meal, some good drinks with a nice atmosphere. Good without being great, but never slid into bad territory. I'd probably lean closer to 3.5 Stars, but not higher than that.",

Lately going out we have been disappointed in the lack of service at so many restaurants. We went in with no expectations other than it looked good on yelp. When you initially look at the menu and the descriptions, it automatically creates a high expectation for the food. I can say that there were 0 disappointments the entire night! We received exceptional service and excellent food! We ordered the Simple Green Salad (far from simple, DELICIOUS LIGHT DRESSING), The Prince Edward Island Mussels (PERFECTLY cooked- all mussels opened and not chewy at all!), The Grilled Lamb Loin, and Seared Red Snapper Veracruz Style- BOTH so unique and flavorful! For Dessert we had the bread pudding (best I have ever had in my life!)  The waiter was extremely personable and the manager came over multiple times to ensure that we were having a great experience. I have respect for this establishment- there are two types of people in this world, people who work for the paycheck and people who work because they love and care about what they do. This staff works for their wonderful reputation.You can tell that the Red Owl Tavern's employees try to establish a relationships with their guests, rather than just trying to flip tables and want to be hospitable. The manager was in communication with us the entire night, ensuring we were having a great experience, as well as the waiter being prompt and attentive from the moment we sat down to when we left. They even gave us the dessert on the house! We will definitely be returning to the Red Owl Tavern next time in Philly.  HIGHLY recommend the Red Owl Tavern:)",

Thankfully they have their own parking lot but there's plenty of street parking too, which is good because it was packed. The inside was nice and cozy and it had plenty of seating, not that it mattered because it was so crowded but I can't fault them for that.\n\nThe customer service was really good, although the guy who took our order didn't seem to believe that I knew what a double shot macchiato would be because he kept asking me if I had ever had one before. I badly needed pure caffeine so it was just what I wanted, I'm just not sure what the questioning about my choice was all about.\n\nThat being said, when I got it it was great, obviously good quality espresso. My husband got their popular hot chocolate which he wasn't a fan of but I really liked since it tasted like actual chocolate instead of like a powder. He also got an espresso bar which was some kind of sugary chocolate treat, and he loved that. Their to go cups are also really cute. It's out of the way but we'll definitely be back.",

First I got in contact with Chelsea Kaplan, the events coordinator, who was so helpful and responsive throughout the planning process.  She always answered my emails right away and made sure that everything was perfect on the day of.  We had the front room for 30 people, and it was a perfect amount of space.  We were all close and cozy without being overcrowded.  It really was such a lovely day!\n\nI chose to have fresh fruit and Danish, orange juice carafes for the champagne I brought for mimosas, and a choice of three entrees for the guests.  Everyone was very happy with the food, which came out really quickly after ordering.  Our main server was Jess, who was AWESOME.  Our other server (I want to say Molly... she is the assistant to Dan) was also AWESOME.  They were so nice and personable and really concerned with making sure everything was perfect.\n\nThe planning was easy, the staff is wonderful, the food is great, the restaurant is adorable and in a great location.  I would recommend to anyone planning an event that they check out West Ave Grille.  It is laid back and intimate.",

Total red flag, but my 5 friends all wanted to stay. And I'm so glad they did! Wow!\n\nThe food was amazing! They did a great job with the chirashi, miso soup, \"monkey brains\" (fried mushrooms), hamachi nigiri, and a crazy awesome roll called the Imperial Dragon or something like that, which showed up at our table in a dragon-shaped foil wrap and ON FIRE!  It was so good that we had to order a 2nd one. \n\nThe only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is value. The sushi is more expensive than average, and the $20 chirashi only came with 6 pieces of sashimi (+2 masago and 2 crab sticks), much fewer than every other place I've been to.\n\nThe rice was great though, in spite of what some other reviews may say.

We decided to stop in here for late night drinks/dessert after visiting Shady Jack's and the Third Degree Glass Factory's third Friday night special event.  \n\nIt was a little tricky to find and I may or may not have ran a stop sign or two as I looked for it.  oopsies! :)  We finally made it inside after my scary driving.  The place is so stinkin' cute.  I love the decorations, the old decor, and the little booths with the radio thing.  \n\nThe menu is slightly overwhelming if you're looking for a delicious alcoholic icecream martini because everything looks so gosh darn good!  After debating for what felt like an hour I finally settled on the Thin Mint martini and boy was it good - a tad strong but YUMTASTIC in my mouth!  \n\nStewart got the Chocolate Covered Almond which also tasted fabulous and the Orange Dreamsicle which I didn't care for.  Then again I don't like orange dreamsicles and this tasted just like one. haha.\n\nKate got The Great Mississippi Mudslide which was amazing as well and the Love Potion #9.  The love potion one tasted interesting - kinda like a liquid PB&J in your mouth which is an odd sensation but exactly what they were going for.\n\nI'd definitely come back and visit again with friends since it was a cute little place and I'd love to try the others I was debating on.   \n\nFunny thing though - I was totally the only one carded! of course I do look like I'm 15 so what can ya expect?! I thought it was funny.\n\nside note: the bathrooms are small and cramped with weird doors.  not a fan.",

But the helpful staff was very knowledgeable about the different dishes and helped steer me in the right direction.  I went with the Pangoa, and it was DELISH!  It was picture perfect actually. Brown rice topped with fresh avacado, cilantro and cherry tomatoes, roasted corn, black beans, chicken and drizzled with a tangy \"spicy\" BBQ sauce (not so spicy for my tastebuds). I'm literally craving it as I type this....My friend got the Cobb salad and he couldn't stop raving about it. Everything was fresh, crisp, delicious and fast!  Also, a greats option for VEGANS, as the have tofu and falafels for all meal options. They also had a huge array of smoothies, a juice cleanse and breakfast options!!!

My fiancé and I have been curious about this place, as we both love Indian food, and we finally got a chance to stop in this week.  They have a handful of beers and wines to choose from and a Coke Freestyle machine for those not partaking in the boozy stuff.  You place your order at the counter and the food is brought out to you.  They serve on actual plates and you get real silverware and glassware.   There are a number of sauces available to try if you want to further spice up your meal.  What rubbed me the wrong way was the fact that the manager was sitting out in the dining room area on her laptop the entire time we were there.  I have a hard time believing that there isn't an office in the back for her to work from.

  "text": "On this most-recent visit to Square 1682, we noticed the menu changed, removing my main draw to the restaurant: the black bean burger. The falafel sandwich that took its place was served on a rather hard bun, rather than traditional pita, which smushed the falafel as you ate and generally overwhelmed the flavors of the tzatziki sauce. (There are plenty of delicious falafel spots in the area that quite simply do it better.)\n\nThe drop in rating comes from the \"Express Lunch\" taking 45 minutes to get to the table (we had 8 people, most of whom ordered the Express Lunch, assuming it would be quicker than the regular menu). 45 minutes is not express and not at all useful when lunching on a time limit. It would've been nice if the server had noted that because Express Lunches are served all 3 courses together, they do not come out as prepared (they're held under a heating lamp till all pieces are ready) and therefore it might be faster for a large group to order off the regular menu. We saw other groups (including some of our colleagues) come and go in the time it took for us to get our food.\n\nI still like the space, as it's quieter than many restaurants, so you can hear one another more easily, but this latest experience took a hit on my recommending it for future meals. A tiny peeve: the \"giant cookie\" was regular-sized (small?) and fine, for oatmeal raisin.",

  "text": "Knockouts opened on Super Bowl Sunday and I have been there twice so far to taste the fare. The decor is that of a boxing ring/gym. It is very clean with a fair bit of room. It is surrounded by a dozen or more TVs for watching multiple games playing at the same time. Their food is focused on standard bar/pub fare with an emphasis on burgers and fried foods. There is a second lounge area that is still under construction. They intend to have Karaoke there twice a week and possibly a cigar bar. The new lounge has a more upscale feel to it and an impressive bar area.\n\nOn the first visit I ordered the BBQ Burger (I forgotten the name it is under on the menu). It is a 1/3 pound burger patty served with onion rings, BBQ sauce and I believe lettuce and tomato. The burger stands pretty tall, too tall for a human being to eat it. However, removing some of the stacked onion rings brought the height down to a useful level. The flavor was good and despite the heft and wetness of a BBQ burger, the bun stood up to the task and did not fall apart. I had a side of onion rings and they were excellent.\n\nMy second visit was today and I only ordered an appetizer for lunch: the stuffed, deep-fried mushrooms. The site of the mushroom heads was about 2\" across and each mushroom had been cut in half before they were deep fried. I think this diminished the whole \"stuffed\" aspect of the mushrooms as there didn't seem to be much stuffing in evidence. The flavor of the mushrooms was excellent, as was the texture of the mushroom flesh, very firm and moist.\n\nThey do have a pool table, 1 or 2 darts machines and the ubiquitous Touch Tunes music system. The staff is very friendly and I found the service to be prompt. The food took a little time to get out, but I suspect that is simply because the place is new and they are still ironing out the kinks.\n\nI'm giving this 5 stars for a sports bar. I can't think of anything I'd change in the place. I'll update the review once the new lounge opens and I have a chance to put the bartender through his/her paces with some classic cocktails!",

  "text": "We ordered the fried oyster and the catfish platter and sincerely speaking it was terrible. Incredibly greasy and please don't tell me it is because it is Cajun food. Moreover, the service is really bad. We wanted to sit but the place was packed so we ordered food and ate while standing up. When there was finally a place the waitress was really rude and said we couldn't sit because we had already ordered food and we were already eating. Hello? Funny thing is that one of the people eating at the bar had the same exact plastic container for to go food that I had. Please, don't ask me for tips on the receipt if you are going to give me a plastic box and will not let me sit in your restaurant.",

  "text": "One of my favorite spots to swing by while in the Ybor area, either with a group of friends or alone, as they do have a lot of space to bring out your laptop to work or read.\n\nSince I usually come during the workday for lunch, I'm a big fan of their specialty coffee drinks. They have a very unique one - espresso lemonade - which I got to try on my last visit. The bitterness was cancelled out by the lemonade and it was delicious.\n\nThe Bricks has a good choice of apps/salads/sandwiches and I also tried a spicy chorizo, creamed soup, which my server recommended, and he was right-on point with this pick.\n\nIf you're in Ybor please make sure you stop by here...it's vegan/vegetarian friendly and just has a good all-around vibe inside.",

The tacos were just as good, but sadly they no longer offer the combo (one of each kind of taco, chicken, beef, and pork). We spoke with the manager (I'm assuming) several times. She made it a priority to speak with all of the customers. The food here is definitely too notch. My only criticism is that our food was slow coming out. Our server was nice enough to inform us that an appetizer was not going to be ready until near when our entrees would be so we just cancelled it. Overall a great experience and worth the try. \nCame back again and got the Fries and Wings and they came right out! Love the people and love the food.",

  "text": "What was once Heritage, same decor and great menu choices but still lacking what Heritage did, great fresh flavor. We ordered the Halibut with lentils and the Chicken Piccata, fried shrimp to start. The fried shrimp was pretty good with a side of Aioli, celery topped with watery blue cheese sauce and a side of dry spinach leaves. We weren't sure how the spinach fit in with the plate, was a bit odd, seemed it could be an amazing dish had the fried shrimp just had blue cheese crumbles and the aioli dipping sauce. The chicken piccata had great presentation with a side of mashed potatoes but lacked that great strong flavor of lemon and caper chicken piccata is known for, this one was bland. The best of it all was for sure the Halibut with lentils, the fish was cooked very well and the lentils added a great flavor. Overall though it seems that the idea of fresh, somewhat local or house made items is there but they are still missing the boat on great flavor that makes you want to come back or make your meal memorable.",

Pros: good and tasty food, definitely not your average lunch stop. They seem to have good options for salads, bowls, soups and juices. Cons: very small portions for an average guy (might be ok for females). Ordered a bowl with protein and it comes with very little protein. I believe this is a common practice for them based on other reviews that I read. Prices are also on the high end. \n\nThe reason why I only gave this number of stars is because I believe the cons listed are quite important to me and make a big impact in my decision to go to a restaurant.",

The hostess was less than excited to greet us with barely a smile and such a low voice we could hardly understand her.  After we sat, it took our server about 10 minutes to greet us, although he was apologetic and cheery.  It then took another 6-7 mins to bring our drinks, one beer and water.  The good was far below par.  My jalepeno shooters were luke warm at best.  My half pound burger was average and her special sirloin lacked any seasoning.  All I can say is that I'm glad we had a gift card from Christmas we used because I would've asked to speak to a manager...which I didn't notice one at all patrolling the floor.

  "text": "I came here for my birthday as mentioned by Aria S. I made reservations for a Wed night for a group of 9 (this is their max). Good thing too, because every table was full. Since this is a BYOB, we had about 7 bottles of wine for the table. As I looked around, every other table had ice for their wine. I had to ask our waiter after about 15 minutes if he could bring us a couple ice buckets for the table. He took our wine and put it over on a window sill. This was a little strange, but it only got worse. We didn't know if it was appropriate to grab it ourselves or if he would pour it for us. We spent the entire evening walking through the restaurant to awkwardly pour wine. Not exactly how I wanted to spend my bday dinner. Its especially frustrating because this is a BYOB restaurant, you'd think this wouldnt have been an issue. Besides this, the service was fine. They also accommodate to the gluten free people out there.\n\nOnto the food. We started with dips of the day, very authentic and tasty. I ordered the braised rabbit leg. I thought the meat itself was fine. I wish it was seasoned better and more tender, especially for $26. Luckily I was able to try a few of my friends' dishes. My favorite was the stuffed pepper. I really wish I ordered that instead. \n\nUnfortunately I will not be coming back here. I wish I was able to have a great experience like some of the people below.",

Loved the salads , fresh buttery foccacio bread sticks(we asked for extras), and pizzas. Cauliflower pizza was our favourite wood fire taste to it..delicious. loved the deserts, devoured them. Antipasto platter was good first course but they mentioned roasted veggies as part of the dish but only thing roasted was cauliflower there was olives and roasted red pepper seemed out of the can. Nevertheless very tasty and finished the plate . Pasta was decent not outstanding.",

  "text": "Cake Life is one of my favorite bakeries-and I've only been there once! I ordered the chocolate chip walnut cookie, while my sister ordered the Campfire Cocoa cake. We received the Fiesta cake by accident, and the server was kind enough to allow us to keep both slices of cake. The cookie was crispy on the outside but chewy on the inside. Could've used a little bit more sea salt but the chocolate chips were so fudgey and rich so I didn't have much to complain about. The campfire cake was delicious. The cake is moist and fluffy, while the whipped cream is chocolatey. Reminded me of the days I'd come back home from school on a winter day and I'd rip one of those Swiss Miss packets open into warm milk. The buttercream is made with Swiss Miss by the way! The Fiesta cake is a bit more dense, with a cream cheese frosting. Definitely an enjoyable experience. The shop itself is very cute and beautiful. I'll be returning... very soon!",

  "text": "I spent two years in Philadelphia for graduate school and Tria was by far my favorite place in the whole city!  I strongly suggest getting one of their membership cards, which offers rewards for frequenting the establishment (such as a $50 gift card). \n\nTria has a great happy hour (5-7) which offers different lists of wine, beer, and cheese at discounted prices. My friends and I always ordered food from there menu and we loved EVERYTHING! I especially love the asparagus salad with white beans, beets with feta cheese, and their lavender pistachio honey drizzled bruschetta.  Their lemon square dessert is amazing as well!   Their menu does change seasonally throughout the year, which I think is nice.  Their variety of wine, beer, and food offers guests a chance to try new items every visit.\n\nYou cannot get reservations at Tria, but they have a decent turn over for smaller groups.  It is more difficult to go with a large group of people, but if you are willing to split up into smaller groups it is well-worth the wait!",

  "text": "Came here for a small bite since we were just passing some time and decided to get some sliders.   They have a regular sliders (cheeseburger, fried chicken) on the board and daily ones (pork belly, fried oyster, blackened chicken Caesar) on a menu.  We decided on the fried chicken sliders, fried oyster, and the pork belly sliders. \n\nFried chicken was delicious.  Perfectly fried, not too heavy.  Their was a nice kick on the chicken along with some jalapeño and a nice slaw to go with it.  Fried oyster was good, too. Nicely battered (cornmeal crusted?) and fried.  Not at all greasy.  You can still taste the oyster. The pork belly was decent.  Just as you'd expect from fatty pork belly with pickled onions.  As you can see, I went from the favourite to least favourite (even though the least favourite is still pretty good).  The sliders are pretty small, so expect yourself to order multiple.  No shame.  And at around 3.50-5$, why not?\n\nThe inside of this place is open and airy.  There's even outdoor seating in the back.  I feel like this place could be on cap hill- somewhat of a hipster vibe, but I liked it.  Didn't get the donuts, but they definitely had a good selection of them!  Next time, must get both.",

  "text": "This is pretty average Mexican food. Way better than Taco Bell (I don't usually classify Taco Bell as Mexican food, but I'm sure others do), but not nearly as good as some other places. There aren't a lot of restaurants that I can walk to from my house, so I'm really happy these guys are here. But if I have a craving for some really good Mexican food, I'm going to have to get in my car.\n\nI've been here 3 times now, and I've gotten the tacos, tostadas, and enchiladas. These were all pretty good. I think the tostadas have been my favorite so far. My husband got a burrito and he said it was just \"ok.\" For sides, the refried beans are pretty legit, but the rice is pretty bad. Either the rice is really old and dried out, or it's not cooked long enough. Either way I don't like my rice crunchy. The tortilla chips and salsa at the table aren't anything special. I do like the green and red hot sauce they have on all of the tables. My husband and I grew up on the west coast, so we have pretty high standards for our Mexican food.\n\nSince this place is pretty new, I'm hoping they improve, and I will update this review if they do. I will keep eating here unless they give me a reason not to. I hope they stick around!",

It was so rich in flavor and color. I enjoyed it with the warm pita.  Next was my chicken kabob \"sandwich\" which was nice hearty chunks of grilled chicken, green and red peppers rolled into another large pita.

They were crispy enough to satisfy that desire, but soft enough not to be overdone like funnel cakes. The taste was great: simple with enough fat to balance out the sugar so it wasn't too sweet. Definitely worth the less than $2 charge. \n\nThe ambiance was fine, having seating both inside (with A/C) and outside. It was cafeteria style. And, for those who don't feel like even stepping out of their cars, there is a drive through. Otherwise, parking is relatively easy (they have their own lot), unlike at the original cafe in downtown New Orleans. Then again, here in this place outside downtown, you're surrounded by memories of anywhere else: Taco Bell, gas stations, etc.",

Every time I go I am never disappointed with their beer selection, and the food menu seems to constantly be improving. If you can't find a beer that you like at WOB, I feel like it is time to move on from the beer world and go to wine bars instead because this place is fantastic. When I go I usually get a new draught beer on tap and then a bottled beer from Evil Twin Brewing Company. Jeppe Jarnit-Bjergsø is the founder of Evil Twin Brewing Company. He has a cool story - \" gypsy brewer\" who launched his beer in Denmark, but then used friends brew rooms in ten places around the world to produce his beer. He is finally opening his first stand alone brewery in Queens, NY this coming spring. I feel like it is a little harder to find his beers, but not at World of Beer! As for the food, I have tried their wings, tacos, chicken sliders, cheese board, and most recently their fried pickles. All of the food items were quite tasty, and if you go during happy hour a lot of the appetizer items are discounted to $5 dollars a piece.

The food was fantastic for all of us, including quite possibly the best porkchop I have ever eaten. Very busy atmosphere, but the ambiance was great. There was a live band with an incredible female vocal who walked around and sang at a table of women celebrating a birthday. Very fun. \n\nI highly recommend this spot and have already made another reservation for our Anniversary!",

My boyfriend had the filet mignon and didn't really even finish it. he also tried the potatoes au gratin and said it tasted almost as though they used easy-mac cheese on them. \nI had the vegetable platter and thats all it was. I have experienced amazing vegetable sides at other restaurants, but this entree was nothing to write home about.\n\nAs for desserts he had the cheesecake, which was fine, not amazing but nothing bad to say about it either. I had the strawberries and once again, thats all it was. Don't expext them to come out plated amazingly or even with whipped cream, they're only sliced strawberries.\n\nHonestly, for the money I don't think it was worth it. I can think of many other places in the city, some of which are much cheaper, that are much more worth your time.",

I had been a couple of years ago during my first visit to St. Louis and I liked the pizza so much that I had to come back.\nI was the only person in the place. I came in at that weird time between lunch and dinner rush. Regardless, the bartender was super friendly. He chatted me up about all of the local beers they have. I finally settled on a Schlafly pumpkin because it's me and it's fall. I didn't have pizza on this visit (not because it isn't amazing because it is, but because I couldn't eat a whole pizza on my own). Instead I ordered a Cesar salad and the meatball appetizer. \nFirst off the salad was freaking huge!!! It was tasty for a Cesar salad though they really are hard to mess up. The meatball appetizer was awesome! You get about 5 meatballs in sauce and covered with cheese alongside a few pieces of bread. The salad and meatballs were the perfect lunch.\nI'll be back friends, as soon as work takes me to St. Louis again.",

We sat at the table for 10 minutes before Stephanie S approached our table.  She took our drink order and said she would bring bread.  She brought the drinks but no bread. Also, she never explained the specials (we happened to overhear the waiter at the table next to us explaining them.) The salad came and I had to ask for the bread.  The food, as usual, was good.  I had tilapia and my husband had mahi, with sides of spinach and garlic mashed potatoes which were all very good.  As soon as I put my fork down, the waitress swooped behind me and took the plate away while my husband was still eating.  She never asked if I was finished.  She seemed very stressed out and her service reflected it.  Such a shame because normally the waitstaff is very cordial and accommodating.",

  "text": "This place.... dang... they make some delicious donuts thats for sure... I stopped in on a few occasions during my week long visit to NOLA (only to their Mag St. location). Each time I visited the line was somewhat longer than what I had hoped. Although, the line went by very quickly. I waited 15 minutes or so tops on a super busy day. I can't really complain there. A few people in my party made a comment about how they should have a separate \"donut to-go\" window for people just wanting to get a quick donut or two to go. What a brilliant idea!\n\nPer their name, they obviously serve items other than donuts. They have breakfast items (about 5 or 6 to choose from) till 11am. At 11am they begin serving lunch items - sliders and tacos. I am a huge fan of biscuits and saw that they make their own there. I had to try one of their breakfast biscuits. I opted to just try a scrambled egg and cheese biscuit sandwich. Holy cow it was delicious. Really hit the spot. \n\nI never got the opportunity to come back for their lunch items but I had heard from friends that their sliders are delicious! After seeing photos of them though, I had wished they were served on something other than little hamburger buns. Not too much excitement there if you ask me. I'd much rather have it on a biscuit.\n\nAnyways, back to the donuts. They offer about 12 or so different donut flavors each day. They have their standard glazed, cinnamon sugar, iced donuts each day. Those are accompanied by different and interesting flavored (and sometimes filled) donuts. Check out their Instagram page to see what they are serving each day. It is a bit addicting logging onto instagram and checking their menus each day - I just wanted to go everyday and try all of them. My wallet would be so mad at me. Being the huge bacon lover that I am, I had been waiting to see their maple bacon donut show up on the menu.. my last day in NOLA, it finally did. I was pumped! It was delicious, fresh, flavorful, and savory. The bacon was honestly pretty good by itself.\n\nI tried two of their drinks as well. The Sproca-Cola and their Arnold Palmer. Sproca-cola was interesting to say the least. I was glad I tried it - but don't think I will get it again. The Arnold Palmer was also pretty decent. My ratio of tea to lemonade was a bit off though - too much lemonade.\n\nThe establishment as a whole appeared clean and organized. My party and I were always able to find a seat no matter how busy it was. So with all of this said, I would definitely go back if in the area again.",

Even though the selection of food isn't very vast, everything I've touched on the menu (which I'm pretty sure is all of it) is very, very good in a homemade meal way.  The staff is the greatest... from Paul to Teresa, to the owner herself.  They make you feel at home and never rushed.  They aren't afraid to voice their opinions on what is especially good that day, and take the time to small chat without seeming obligated.  There's a cute outdoor area in the back, and it's fairly easy to grab and go if that's your intention.  Beware that the place is small, but crowds seem to get in and out fairly quickly... mainly because the food comes out fast; hard to believe when only cooking on a couple burners and a toaster over.  The name Ants Pants can translate into The Bee's Knees in the US... I'm not really sure how either reference came into play, but it stands true at Ants Pants.  You'll end up being happy for half the day after eating here, and might meet some new friends along the way.\nNote: get the bacon stack, and any soup special they have.",

Well worth splurging for them. \n\nMy friends were drawn in by the awesome looking burger they had, and indeed the burgers were all they hoped for. It came with a generous portion of crispy fries. But if you want anything else besides the $17 burgers, expect to spend over $30 for your entree. While the ambience feels and looks casual, it is fine dining.\n\nUnfortunately, the waiter did sell the shrimp and grits with the additional crab as \"heaven in his mouth\", but that it was not. I've had better shrimp and grits in Atlanta, and there is no reasonable way you should be paying $30 for shrimp and GRITS. Without the crab, it was still over $20.\n\nBut everything else was great. Drinks were delicious. Everything came out pretty quickly. Oh, when we mentioned we were visiting from out of town, the waiter was nice enough to give us a complimentary appetizer of the cool pizza to start. It was great but the name is hard to say or remember. And the rabbit and chicken liver pate was super worth since it comes in a huge mason jar.\n\nI recommend sticking to the drinks, appetizers, and burgers and you'll be a pretty happy camper.",

The scallops prosciutto app, del mar pizza with crab and scallops, and crab stuffed portabella app (comes with a crab and lobster bisque- YUM) are all delicious!!  I also love the roasted portabella app- for a vegetarian option, it is delicious and was recomended by someone who isn't.

We went in one night about an hour or so before closing just to find that they were only serving a partial menu - we're not talking that late, it was like, 9:30 on a weekend.  There was no mention of going down to a bar menu on the website so I was a bit annoyed by that.  Something about 'surprise disappointments that could be totally avoided' really bother me.  So, the dish I had picked out online wasn't available and I ordered a burger instead.  The server seemed to have a very hard time understanding my burger and suggested that modifications couldn't be made?  I told him I'm sure removing a single topping wouldn't cause the kitchen staff any issues...  The rest of the meal we were generally ignored and the service wasn't great.  I found the food to be overpriced for the quality.  Unless there is a special reason to attend, I don't think we'll be going back.",

There is a small food menu, but the selection isn't that great. To add insult to injury the food made me ill. The reviews about service aren't exaggerations. We, too, practically had to tackle our server to order food and drinks many of times. Not my preferred place to go when there are so many better options in Reno.",

We pulled up about 8pm and the open sign was turned off. We thought maybe the light was burnt out or someone just forgot to plug it in. So we proceeded to the door. There were people inside and the sign said open till 11pm, so we walked inside. It was like walking into the Twlight Zone, everyone stopped and stared at us. The woman behind the bar came over and told us they were closed. HUH! Ok.... so we left. It was very akward and unpleasant. If they were closed then the door should of been locked or a sign on the door stating private party or something. \nNot sure if we will attempt to try to dine there again.",

No drinks, water etc. Finally a waiter in another section took out order. We ordered BBQ shrimp (best thing on our table), rabbit and wood plank grilled fish.

Thought that would transfer to this location - not at all.\n\nTo sum it up, our server was extremely energetic, but not in a good way. More like a frantic energy. I was there to enjoy a few drinks and dinner with a friend who was visiting (AKA looking to spend money AKA you will get a larger tip if you let us stay longer) and we were rushed out. Server brought boxes for food we were still eating, without asking if we wanted them. A few minutes later he physically put the food in the boxes at the tableside while mumbling something like \"I don't like food sitting on the table.\" .....we didn't even want to take it home. Next, when we said we were having another friend join for another round or two of drinks he told us we couldn't stay at the booth we were at and we needed to go to the bar. What? I point blank asked him if he was kicking us out of the booth and he said \"yes!\" energetically. There was no one waiting for tables and there were numerous open tables/booths around the restaurant. I felt extremely uncomfortable and wanted to leave immediately. Our friend joined after all this happened, and when the server came over to ask if they wanted a drink, he seemed surprised when we told him we were just going to leave. YOU LITERALLY just told us we couldn't sit at this table any longer!! We then left.\n\nI worked in restaurants for a long time and I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to restaurant service. I was not pleased at all during this visit.\n\nOn another note, the food was not that great.",

  "text": "Milktooth is the place to go if you want a good breakfast cocktail and a twist on traditional brunch. At first glance of the menu, you may think you've never heard of any of these foods for breakfast, and you may be right. I guarantee no matter what you order, you're going to enjoy it. \n\nMilktooth is one of the most popular brunch places in Indy, which means you will typically have a wait. Trust me, it's worth the usual 30 minute wait (on weekends). To make it go by a little faster, they've got a walk up bar for their coffee drinks and pastries. Snack on one of those to give you a preview of the amazing meal you're about to have.\n\nTheir menu changes from time to time but they have a few things that stay one the menu but change ingredients. I love all of their variations on a Dutch pancake, and their raclette grilled cheese is to die for.  If you're making this a boozy breakfast, don't pass up on the michelada. And sit outside if it's warm enough!",

  "text": "Oh Chickie's and Pete's, you are the perfect place to watch some sports and indulge. \n\nNo doubt this is not the best food I've ever had but, if you can get a seat, grab some beer with mussels red and crab fries, there's no way not to thoroughly enjoy this place during a game or any time you're down by the stadiums. \n\nMy favs are the crab fries, mussels red (white is overloaded with garlic that I can't always take it), the spicy pull and peel shrimp, steamers, and if the mood is right the blue crabs (it's a lot of work but tasty). This place also makes getting down and dirty with your food easy. There are sinks all over so you can rinse the mess off your hands once you're done....good touch.\n\nTo sum it up, Chickie's and Pete's is a Philadelphia institution and always a good time. I strongly suggest going at least once to enjoy the experience. \n\nPlease note: Make sure to remember two things before coming during major sporting events. 1. You'll never get a table and 2. You'll deal with a ton of drunk people. I've absolutely been one of these people before and we can get annoying unless you're in the right frame of mind. :)",

The Ponchartrain was quite good with mushrooms and a cream sauce.  We also had the shrimp cocktail and lump crab cake appetizers....both fine, but not wonderful.

The attention to detail with the remodel was outstanding, it almost feels like you are in a Harry Potter movie or something.  There is background music that is set at a low volume so you can clearly hear your friends or not have to shout for them to hear you - perfect for the old library-esque environment. Working behind the bar were Michael and Peggy - both couldn't have been more friendly and were overall just interesting people to talk to.   I had eaten dinner already before I came so can't speak on the food but will definitely be back to try - the prices for meat/cheese trays are much better than comparable places in the area.  I would definitely recommend checking this place out...",

My wife had the tri-tip salad -- greens on one side of the plate with a balsamic vinagrette balanced by four good-sized slices of medium-rare tri-tip and potato \"croutons\" --\nlittle heavenly bits of crunchy potatoes. I had the tri/tip/chicken combo, selecting the fresh corn salad and potato salad as my two sides. It was so good that we ordered dessert as well (not something I do regularly). The offering was lemon meringue, mudd pie, apple pie, and ice cream. We shared the first -- again delicious, with real, perfectly set and browned meringue. The prices were very reasonable for the quality of food and the experience. We've already recommended to family and friends locally, and expect to return soon. Well done!",

It's no longer there-used to be next to restrooms. There is still a payphone back there which I love. There are now ATM's at front entrance.\n  The blue ribbon is now $3.79, but still a bargain since it includes everything: pancakes, 2 eggs, toast, sausage, bacon,juice & coffee. I ate here with my kids. My daughter's choice. Says she \"loves Tom Jones\". Our meals included blue ribbons, french toast, chicken, club sandwich & baked potato . Everyone gets what they like. \n   I don't smell stale smoke and would not call it dirty.  I like the \"loud\" orange booths. I feel like I went back in time with these and the payphone. Service is always fast and I always seem to get a different waitress. Don't know where they find these young ladies but they're good. I've seen different managers there and they are all quick and on top of things-which makes a good manager.\n   Since it's my daughter's fave I'm bumping it up from 4 to 5 stars.",

Their website which is fairly useless if you want to figure out the menu before going, you have to pick your location choice out of 3 locations and then drill down to the bottom to see the weak descriptions of their menu offering, no explanations and no price, just this\n\n    Roast Beef\n    Roast Beef Combo\n    Roast Pork\n    Roast Pork Combo\n    Baked Ham\n    Baked Ham Combo\n    Roast Turkey\n    Roast Turkey Combo\n    Broccoli Rabe\n    Broccoli Rabe Combo\n\n\nNo explanation of whats in a combo (its just where they add cheese by the way)\n\nThe table placecard (instead of menu) had a more detailed description than the website.  \n\nWhen I walked in, its more bar than restaurant, no big deal, but there were tables.  Since I couldnt decide and the sandwiches werent too expensive at $6.85, I got the roast beef and roast port combos.\n\nI got my two sandwiches fast enough, but the roast beef was cold and the roast pork was hot.  Not sure how a cook (for lack of a better word) could serve 2 things at the same time with such a temperature differential, one was obviously sitting for awhile.  I asked the waitress to reheat the roast beef while I finished the roast pork, and supposedly it was reheated, since it was warmer, but it was still cold-ish compared to my roast pork I had just finished.  The waitress did offer to replace it when she inquired, but I was in a hurry and didnt really care for a hot version of this sandwich.\n\nThe sandwiches were very skimpy on meat, but they \"made up for it\" by adding too much gravy to make it overly messy and the bread was disintegrating.  The menu place card mentions the \"wet meat\" option where you get less gravy, I strongly recommend you get it that style, especially if the gravy overpower the meat and structural integrity of the sandwich.",

All of their beers are very good, and I am also a fan of their burgers and tenderloins.  Therefore, I was excited to try their pizza, but I don't think it ended up being on par with these other items.  My margherita pizza had a cracker-like crust and was pretty light overall.  The cheese was good, but none of the other toppings added much flavor.  There was no red sauce as is typical for a true margherita pizza.  My opinion is that Upland's pizza might serve as a nice appetizer for a group, but I'll be sticking with their burgers or tenderloins as my meal of choice on future visits.",

  "text": "The only reason I didn't give this restaurant a 5 star rating, is because of one single pretentious waiter. As a 4 night guest at Hotel Palomar, the location of the restaurant is an obvious plus. The first night of my stay, I met a coworker in the restaurant for a cocktail. When we arrived, the host staff were busy and not available, so we just walked in. The restaurant was not too busy, so we just looked at a small table next to the bar and proceeded to take a seat. A waiter came by and I quickly asked if we could have a seat, before sitting down and told him we'd only be having cocktails. He stumbled on his reply, and in an irritated/in-convinced tone, told me \"I guess it would be fine\" and basically just kept walking mid sentence. My guest and I brushed it off, and started having a conversation while looking at the drink menu. To make a long story short, he was distant and we both got the \"couldn't be bothered\" vibe from him. When it came to the bill, we asked if it could be split due to company transaction policies, and you would have thought asked him for some inconceivable task. We basically spent the rest of our night and elevator ride to our room in shock of the rudeness we had just experienced. \n\nAlthough that situation left a bad taste in our mouth, and the night before we decided to avoid the restaurant, we decided to grab another cocktail and give this place one more try. After looking around and ensuring \"last nights waiter\" wasn't on shift, we walked over to the bar and started looking over the menu. Instantly, the bartender greeted us with pleasant small talk and made us feel 100% welcome. He asked about our day, recommended cocktails and was a completely genuine person. This guy (I think his name was Ben) is an absolute star! He gave us lessons on Whiskey, described how to make classic cocktails, and was 100% invested in our experience. This is exactly what a bartender at a 4/5 star establishment should be - actually he exceeds that. He was kind, funny, friendly and completely redeemed this restaurant/bar from our terrible experience the night before. \nI also ordered room service last night from this restaurant, and it was amazing. The bacon wrapped dates and chocolate cake are to die for! Great restaurant and amazing bartender(s). Too bad one bad egg could have spoiled this experience.",

I am ashamed because it's a St. Louis tradition and remorseful because I missed out on it for so..many...years! \n\nThis place is amazing. What is not to love! It's a factory where you can get a tour (Friday-Sunday, noon-5pm on the hour), there's a shop, bar, and dining area. They also host many event with live music on the weekends. It's fun to just kind of wander and look around - don't worry, you'll get a chance because there will likely be a wait before you dine. The beer is, of course, amazing. The Hefeweizen is my personal favorite and a great start for anyone who is not a huge beer drinker (like myself). Additionally, the food is homegrown and damn good. I had the pizza (recommendation from my server) and it was really spectacular, though I'm admittedly a pizza connoisseur so I enjoy a good pizza pie more than most probably ;P My date had a bison burger which was also really good. \n\nMore fun info: the service is great! I think they tend to hire more funky and alternative people (like tattoo parlor staff) which I support. The quality is what makes this place stand out along with the emphasis on local food and brewery. \n\nIt is a little on the pricier side but for all the experience you get and the quality, it is worth it. I will go again and again and you probably should, too!",

  "text": "Fun fact, I \"recently\" moved somewhat close to the \"Hill\". In fact, on the day that I finally found my apartment, my parents and I were driving down the road and stumbled upon a building adorned with a big, red, flashing sign-it read, \"Joey B's on the Hill.\" Since we were famished from all of the decision making, we decided to give it a whirl.\n\nNow, Joey B's is not quite located in the same area as the rest of the Hill restaurants, so I was anxious to see what it was like-most of the others are sit down, semi-nice, lit by the light of 1,000 candles types of places. You know, your typical Italian joint--checkered table clothes and all.\n\nJoey B's was a little different as it looked a little more like a sports bar than most other places on the Hill--fewer candles, more big screen TVs. [Of course, my father was extraordinarily pleased that he could watch the Nascar race while we ate, so it was all good.]\n\nAfter looking over the menu, my mom decided to order the French Dip and my dad and I decided to split a pizza-half supreme, half BBQ chicken. That's half sausage, pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, green pepper & onion and half grilled chicken, red onion and provel cheese with BBQ sauce. Let's just be honest. This was a mistake. And the mistake was my fault. I was the one who ordered the BBQ half of the pizza and it just did not hold a candle to the \"regular\" half of the pizza.\n\nYes, I'll admit that for once in my life a pizza with provel cheese on it--impressed me. I didn't expect that! But, the BBQ pizza was too sweet and I'm sad to say that we didn't eat much of it.\n\nLuckily, my dad let me have a little of his and I was so glad he did, because his half of the pizza was much better than mine.\n\nThe pizza had a nice crunchy crust, but it didn't crumble and fall apart like some thin crusts can. Plus, the sauce was really good. Nice and tangy. In fact, I believe that the menu said that this was Rachel Ray's favorite pizza sauce--and who can argue with that?\n\nAll in all, it was just good pizza. No, not the *best* I'd ever had, but good. Plus, it was pretty BIG too-definitely enough to share. So either go in expecting left overs or take a BIG appetite.\n\nNow that we've talked pizza, let's talk about the [unexpected] best part of the meal. My mom's french dip sandwich.\n\nThin, juicy, sliced roast beef served with its own au jus and melted provel cheese on French bread. This sandwich was very moist and very flavorful. I would have to describe it as comfort food... to the point where I am seriously look forward to going there in the winter and having one.\n\nPlus, once again, I'm proud to say that I enjoyed the provel cheese on this dish! *gasp!* Maybe St. Louis is stealing my soul.... Or maybe Joey B's just knows how to use juuuustttt enough provel to bring the flavor palette in without overwhelming the taste buds. Yeah, I'll go with the second option.\n\nOther menu items that we selected included onion rings (very heavily breaded, but pretty good... your standard onion rings) and side salads (again, the provel cheese was good on these salads. Shocking!). It was all just very satisfying; a nice hearty, savory meal.\n\nSo, what's the final judgement? The food was good (and partially changed my mind about provel cheese), the service friendly, and the atmosphere upbeat but not super exciting. I'd have to grade Joey B's like this:\n\nFood: A-\nAtmosphere: B\nService: A\nPrice: $\nPortion Size: Large\n\nIt truly seemed like a great place to grab a pizza and a couple beers and hang out with your friends. I definitely plan on returning and you should check it out too. Let me know what you think when you go!\n\nHappy eating!",

  "text": "Probably my least favorite thing I did in New Orleans. It was a boring boat tour with a guide that had the strangest accent. It felt like he was slurring through the entire two hour tour. Not very interesting insights either and it was so freaking hot on the boat I was just trying not to pass out from the heat and humidity. They stuff these boats to the brim and it's a total tourist trap. The water is brown and there is little to see. Much better off doing a swamp tour so you can at least see alligators and birds.  The one positive is they don't charge an arm and a leg for cold drinks which are an absolute must on this tour if you must go. So many other fun things to enjoy, I'd skip this one if I were you.",

I can't say much that put its in a different class then the other local stake houses though.\n\nOne thing to note is their 'happy hours'.  I've had several meetings at the bar during that time (5:00 to 6:30?) where the drinks are $6 and so are their 'Bar Bites' menu.  They have mini crab cake, burger and stake sandwiches - three of each for $6.  The burger and stake sandwiches are rib-eye I believe and really good.  They also have $2 oysters.\n\nAll in all - You can get a $195 shot of Lewi and a $175 porterhouse or a decent $6 sandwich and all with the same great service.\n\n**Please do the rest of us a favor and don't bring your kids here.  Thank you!**",

I had the house omelet. The Greek inspiration for this omelet was a pleasant change from the normal omelets served in most breakfast places. Yes, they do call their fries \"Freedom\" fries.

We visited on a night when there weren't very crowded so it was nice to be able to have such an attentive waitress and service.  I was a bit disappointed when I didn't find as much on the menu as I would have liked to have seen that would appeal to me.  I guess I have become very picky with my Yelp addiction in terms of scrutinizing every establishment I go to pretty thoroughly.  \n\nI ordered the hummus appetizer for the table and was very pleased at the quality of the dish.  For my entree I ordered their Bricks Salad which had plenty of fresh produce packed in.  I ordered a double portion of chicken for it, which still seemed pretty skimpy especially since I was charged for that request.  Overall, I'd say this is probably one of Ybor's lesser known spots as its more on the western edge of the main strip, yet it seems very lively and upbeat.  I did like that they had featured lots of artwork by various local artists that were on display and offerred for sale.  Not a bad place to hang out and have a drink if you're looking for a lower key outing in the Ybor area.",

The hibachi is also fantastic and fun. Way more than enough food. The scallops are phenomenal too. We have had a lot of different sushi rolls here and all of them are fantastic. You can't wrong. The fried rice is awesome. You can't go to this restaurant without eating the fried rice or you will miss out. Our meals range from $60 on up depending on what you order. The best suggestion I can make if you want to save money is to go during lunch. You can get the lunch box and it has a little bit of everything. The owner is awesome he remembers everyone that comes on. Every time we walk in he makes us feel so welcome and he even remembers if we don't have kids with us or not.

Hot and crusty on the outer edges but a tad cool in the center.

Soondobu jjigae is a very popular menu item and therefore hard to go wrong with but somehow they made my mom ask for salt.  Bland.  My spicy kalbitang on the other hand was so over the top spicy that I kept turning to my rice.  I loved how they bring out rice in the little stone bowls.  The waiter was really cute when he brought me white rice and my mother brown/bean rice without having to ask.\n\nThe interior is also spacious and clean.  Would definitely return for a meal before hanareum shopping.",

Lots of sausage in the gravy and a bit of pepper.  I gave it a try.  The sausage gravy was very tasty as was the orange juice.  I didn't enjoy the biscuits.  They were very hard and smothering them in gravy didn't help much.  I also thought this place deserved more than one dollar sign.  It was a bit pricy.  All in all, pretty good.",

However, the service we received was atrocious.  I'd cut the woman some slack if I saw a doctor's note certifying that she was really mute, but she wasn't sharing.  Her response to us ordering was sighing and rolling her eyes.  WTF?  The good thing was,  I was not here to make friends.  I came here with one purpose in life - to slay a mighty roast beef n gravy Po Boy.  It was just what I wanted and more.  So good.  Sweet potato fries are bomb, too.  Good selection of Abita.  Hush puppies were whatever.  Kinda tasteless and underwhelming.  Bread pudding was amazing.  Overall, the food was a 4+, but the service brought my rating down.  I felt like we got one of the only people on Bourbon St. NOT having a good time.",

The décor isn't one to write home about, primarily greenish booths that can be a little tight for those with a belly.  But I must say it looks better now than it did 25 years ago.\n\nThe menu has lots of items; soup, noodles, rice, and entrees and most under $10.  They give you a pen and paper to write down your order and we ordered 2 items using the menu number.  The black bean rice noodles came with lots of sauce and vegetables.  My colleague ordered the seafood with vegetables which had shrimp, fried squid, and squid.  Both of the dishes were good, but I liked the noodles better.\n\nThe prices are cheap, and our meal came to $20 with leftovers too! Come for the good food and don't expect much for service or atmosphere.  Or you could also order take out if you don't want to eat it.  They only take cash though but there's at ATM in the restaurant.",

  "text": "Jenna and Noel exhibited the perfect example of impeccable service and genuine hospitality. I was driving when I got a flat tire and had to pull into the Fleming's parking lot. The roadside assistance service was taking forever so I walked into Fleming's for food and drink. The kitchen was closed at 2:00 and not opening until 4 o'clock for dinner, but Jenna and Noel happened to overhear my telephone conversation about my flat tire situation. They immediately poured me a drink and asked the Chef to open the kitchen early to cook me a meal. After they also invited me to try a new wine they were considering adding to the menu. They went above and beyond for me during a time they were not supposed to be working simply because they knew I was dealing with a stressful situation. Acts of kindness like this are rarer than gold. I never do online reviews but I could not let this story go untold. Thank you for the excellent food and service! Will certainly be back!",

I had a hard time deciding what to order and after she questioned my taste, she recommended the salmon along with a perfectly paired white wine. I have to say, best salmon ever!

  "text": "We have loved Schlafly for many years as we lived just blocks away and love their beer and food. So, when we had guests in town, we decided to drive a bit and take them to Bottleworks on a nice fall day to enjoy a few drinks before dinner at our place. What in the heck happened to this place? Saturday afternoon, the patio was about 2/3 full, but we got a 30-45 minute wait for 15 people including a few babes. On top of that, we were told we had to order food if we sat on the patio. Fine, we will order a few appetizers. Nope, it had to be entrees. After promising to make it up to the server and tip well, we were given a pager. Waited 45 minutes to be seated as we watched tables sit empty. Once seated, some of our group ordered entrees because the server made them feel bad, so that made the meal I already had prepared completely worthless. The topper was when we got our checks, the server told us we were not as bad as she expected and to come back again when we got babysitters for the babies. So is there some new trend in hospitality to treat your guests like this that should make them want more? \nI do hold a special place in my heart for this place as we used to walk there with our kids all the time and even hit up their markets and other events, but I was so embarrassed for talking this place up the way I did and actually driving more than a mile to go here. Surely, Schlafly realizes that there is another great brewery right down the street that has a much better vibe and appreciation for their guests. Live and learn.",

  "text": "Trident never disappoints for me.  It's going to largely be bar cuisine but I find it quite delightful.  I go here not when I'm in the mood for something healthy (though the Paleo Bowl would fulfill that if  you are looking for something healthy) I go here when I went delicious bar food.\n\nIf you like regular nachos, the kind with real melted cheese (not fake cheese sauce), these are some of the best you can get.  They're nothing crazy, no unique twist, just damn good nachos.  If you want fancier nachos, try elsewhere.  But here is going to be one of your best options for straight up regular delicious nachos.  The half portion is more than sufficient for one person.  I cannot even imagine trying to tackle the full portion. I'm a vegetarian so I never get it with beef, but you can totally add a meat option should you wish.\n\nAlso delicious is their mac and cheese.  It's so cheesy, never dried out, and always has some nice cheese melted right on top.  You can get it as a side with many of their burgers, or you can order the entrée sized.  And in my opinion, you can never go wrong by adding green chiles to the mac and cheese.  Because green chilis are a gift.\n\nI love their caprese appetizer as well.  Standard mozzarella, tomato, basil, balsamic.  But it's always tasty.  Same with the mozzarella sticks.  Their white bean hummus plate is also delicious.\n\nThe other thing I love about trident is they do what, in my opinion, all restaurants with burgers should do, they say at the top you can take any burger and substitute a veggie patty.  It's baffling to me how many places don't even offer a veggie burger at all (they're frozen!  not that hard to keep them stocked!) or if they do, they're hesitant or unwilling to accommodate a request to add it to a different burger than the one veggie burger listed on the menu.  Why in the world, if you already have veggie patties on hand, do I have to order the ONE veggie burger you have listed?  Why can't I just substitute the veggie patty onto any other option?  It drives me bonkers.  But for Trident, this is never the case!  The mushroom swiss looks good to you?  They'll make it with a veggie patty.  The green chile burger looks great?  They'll make it a veggie.  Etc., etc., etc.  It's a standard Boca Burger, which are ok.  Normally I avoid Boca Burgers, but Trident makes me excited to eat a veggie burger!  I recommend the Green Chile with a Boca Burger, and add a fried egg.  Side salad and no bun if you want low carb.  Or, if you're indulging, side of mac & cheese.\n\nFor non-vegetarians, my friends are always happy to eat here too.  Popular choices among my friends include the grilled shrimp skewers, the non-veggie burgers, the crispy shrimp po-boy, and the paleo bowl.\n\nThey also have a fully stocked bar.  Good prices on their beverages.  And the wait staff has always been friendly and kind.\n\nWord of caution, if there's football on, it's probably going to be crowded here.  So plan accordingly.",

  "text": "Looking for a delicious New Year's Day brunch was hard this year in New Orleans. We didn't want to wait in line and wanted instant gratification. Although we may have felt tired, my bf and I were appropriately dressed to go to Mr. B's. As soon as we walked in, I felt transported into a different world. Jazz music was playing and I felt at home. \n\nFirst of all, I could not have been more grateful for the fresh loaf of bread we were given. We devoured it in a matter of minutes. Then came the gumbo ya-ya. It was spicy and savory and everything I expected from a gumbo. Finally came the bbq shrimp. We had been warned that these shrimp did come with their heads and tails on. Bibs were placed around our necks and we were off. The shrimp were some of the most rich and delicious ones I have ever tasted. The sauce they were served with was divine. Although it was messy, there is no other dish on the menu I would have traded for this.\n\nOverall, service was friendly and quick at Mr. B's. The food was delicious, although a little pricey. Definitely try the brunch if you are able to.",

We ended up getting the Carmine's trio (crab cakes, scallops and toasted ravioli). Crab cakes were above average. The scallops were a little saccharine for my tastes but the ravioli was good; and let's face it...one doesn't come to St. Louis for the scallops. Thankfully the filet mignon was exceptional. It was the perfect size, not too salty and rare just like I had requested. \n\nThis was partnered with an above average wine list to make a great night out.",

Firstly, I came here specifically for the chicken slider because from the picture it showed that you can get it on a biscuit and when I told the lady taking my order, she said they don't do that -__-. Then I wanted that buttermilk bites and they weren't available, however, my brother ordered the brown buttered cream sundae and got the buttermilk bites in that!! Oh yes, and the glazed donuts are so thick and dry. I liked the sliders I had though: fried chicken, beef belly and catfish(okay). And the sundae is pretty tasty.

They don't have a full bar, but you can still get a real margarita, and they pack a punch! They make them at their other location and bring them over, which is clever, because this location doesn't yet have its liquor license. Overall 4 out 5 stars because it's a good Mexican restaurant, but 5 stars is reserved for my most favorites only. Close second though, and we love that it's right downtown.

  "text": "I used to live a few doors down from Las Cazuelas in 2005 and went there faithfully because the food is DELICIOUS! I dont' know if they still make it, but the Chilean sea bass with pumpkin mole was one of the tastiest things I've ever eaten. \nMy husband and I visited last Sunday for Brunch and we ordered a TON of food because we had a $50 gift certificate to use up. I can highly reccommend the Huevos Divorciados and the Omlette Poblano. I am a poblano and mushroom lover and the oaxaca cheese melts into the eggs and veggies in the most wonderful way. My husband had the Divorciados and it was both unusual and tasty! \nMy favorite at Las Cazuelas are the tacos- the steak with fresh onions and cilantro is by far the winner in my book and I confess, I have dreamed of them and often cannot resist the urge to go get a big plate of them! We tried the marinated steak tacos this time and did not like them very much- there was a red coating of marinade on the steak and it was overwhelming. You could not taste the yummy, meat-y, grilled flavor that is so great in the regular steak tacos. My husband loved the shredded pork tacos and I thought they were ok. The shrimp tacos are always a winner and taste fresh, crisp and light. I suppose it is the pure flavors and how they usually treat the fresh ingredients that brings me back time and again, I will veer away from the overly marinated items in the future. As always, the cafe de Olla (coffee with cinnamon +) and desserts are very good. I tell everyone about this place and always bring it up as an option when we have folks in from out of town. Keep up the great work!!",

I went there recently and ordered coffee, and clearly stated that I wanted it with no sugar.  The girl at the window handed me the coffee, which was loaded with sugar.  I went through again, and asked for what I ordered.  Another employee gave me another coffee, made as I originally ordered, but she made no apology, and seemed annoyed.

  "text": "I'm still a bit in awe of the experience my wife and I had at Livery yesterday evening, and am trying to think through how to succinctly cover everything I want to share - but simply put, it was incredible.\n\nContext:\nIt was our Golden Anniversary last night, 6 years on the 6th... We had just briefly met Exec. Chef Casey Frank at an event this last Thursday, and decided to celebrate at Livery as we'd been meaning to stop by for awhile now. It seems he must have 1.) seen us come in; 2.) recognized who we were from the event; and 3.) remembered we had mentioned it was our anniversary that night - because after we placed our order of a salad and two entrees, the server came back out and informed us we should \"...forget about your order\" and wait for the experience Chef had lined up for us... \nWhat followed was an astounding 8-course small plate journey, with some of the most delicious and memorable flavor profiles we've encountered in Indianapolis. Chef Casey came out on two occasions to chat with us about the food and make sure we were having a good time. We felt like nothing short of royalty at 6:30pm on a Sunday. \n\nFood: (I'll highlight just a few dishes so as not to write a novel) \nSweet Plantains were culinary genius. Sweetness of the plantain, saltiness of black bean puree, spice from the habanero guajillo sauce, and brininess of the pickled onion in the pineapple salsa were perfectly balanced. The combinations were so complex, but you could still individually identify each component and the role they played in the dish. \nPork Tenderloin could be cut with a fork and was full of flavor. Slight char on the outside gave it smoke, which was complemented by an incredible sweet corn puree and spicy serrano hot sauce. \nScallop was the most well-prepared I've had in a long time. Perfect golden-brown sear on the outside, and so tender with not one bite of grit... A feat that, in my book, is quite an accomplishment! Served with a roasted carrot and poblano pico garnish, it was another masterful balance of sweet and heat while letting the seafood shine.\nChurros were a playful and well-executed nod to Latin street fare. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, with a wonderful caramel sauce that was obviously made in-house. \n\nService:\nOur server Tommy was a delight, from the first moment when he brought us 2 complimentary champagnes to toast. Friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive, he engaged my wife and I just enough to provide quality service and make sure everything was in order, while giving us privacy to enjoy each other's company. We very much enjoyed his service!\n\nI honestly don't know what we did to deserve such a gift, but sincere and heartfelt thanks - To Chef Casey, Tommy, and Livery - for making our Golden Anniversary so very special. My only regret is not taking pictures before devouring every bite! We will certainly be coming back, and are adamant about spreading the word on this gem of an Indy restaurant.",

It was packed on a Wednesday night at 7pm, which I actually saw as a good sign and the service and quality of the food definitely met my expectations. My expectations were lower based on the fact that it is part of a small restaurant group, but they were exceeded by the experience and ambiance. The salads are all good and the salmon was cooked really well. I guess I could even say that the portion was too big for me (which is rare for me!), but overall I left with no complaints and the bread was really good!",

The food is incredible made fresh to order there are NO microwaves in this hip joint ! The pizza is off the wall the Italians wouldn't believe what these guys can do with a little dough I highly recommend the buffalo chicken pizza it will blow your socks right off ! The atmosphere is perfect.  A bunch of hungry college kids looking for some good food and the prices are just right. Oh one more thing the chicken soup is a real winner I still haven't been able to reproduce it , this soups is prepared fresh daily with super chunks of breasts of chicken so don't be shy use the scoop it straight  from the bottom and serve it up hot!",

  "text": "I visited Joey B's for lunch today. My experience was just ok. They were busy. The waiter was friendly and helpful, but service was slow and our food took a long time to come out. \n\nThe decor is a tad nicer than your average sports bar, but the layout is fractured into several small compartments and they have flat screen TVs galore, but they are not positioned in a way that most of the seated folks can comfortably watch the game. \n\nThe menu consists of standard pizza, salad, sandwiches and pasta fare.  My lunch partner ordered a burger and liked it. I ordered the tutto mare and was disappointed. It was slopped in the bowl, drowning in sauce and too rich to eat more than a few bites. The clam flavor was strong and overpowered the remainder of ingredients. My salad was soggy and too sweet. I know that local Italian salads have a tendency to be sweet, but this one was seriously over the top. Prices were a little high for the quality of food. \n\nOverall, my experience was just OK. I will go back if others invite me, but I won't go out of my way to eat here. \n\nBTW, I'm getting bored with the argument about provel cheese. It is a local favorite. Every area around the country has a \"cheese\" that's typically used, and here it is provel. Giving a restaurant 1-star because they serve a local favorite is ridiculous. Also, just because you've \"been around\" doesn't mean you are a cheese expert. I've been around the world and most of the states in this great country and the argument can be made that most of the cheese available today isn't real. If you don't like it, don't eat it.",

My husband got a shrimp po boy with fries and I had a buffalo chicken wrap with sweet potato fries that was the day special and they were both REALLY good. Or maybe we were just really hungry. The service was on the good side of average- our waitress was a little forgetful but funny and was at least trying.  And my drink had a plastic mermaid with it. And an umbrella. And it wasn't even a fruity chick drink, so it made me happy. Strange to find a surfing bar theme in downtown New Orleans, but they made it work!",

  "text": "My girlfriends and I ate at the Creole House for dinner. Our decision to dine here was largely based on the fact that it was pouring raining and this restaurant is next door to our hotel. We started with the bacon garlic oysters and jumbo buffalo wings. The bacon garlic oysters were average, at best. The oysters were overpowered by the cheese and bacon, which was disappointing. The buffalo wings were pretty good and seasoned well. For entrees, we ordered: 1) jumbalaya pasta, 2) blackened red fish and 3) canal street red fish. The jumbalaya pasta lacked flavor and was our least favorite (would not order again). The blackened red fish was just okay and the skimpy side of sautéed veggies (spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms) were VERY salty (would order again as a LAST resort). The canal street red fish wasn't great but my friend would order it again. Her biggest complaint was that it had very little garlic sauce. We also ordered paddle boat drinks, which tasted good but were more juice vs alcohol (had to order an extra shot).\n\nSo, overall, we were underwhelmed with the food, making it a solid 3 stars. On a positive note, our server, Alexander, was great...very hospitable and tried his best to make sure we were satisfied.",

  "text": "Okay, don't jump on me for this, but its partially my fault because I held them to such high expectations (due to the hype and anticipation of them opening up here) before actually eating at this location. I read so much about it on Facebook and the likes......so reading and seeing the yummy pics; well I just knew it would be all that.....untill yesterday.....\n\nMe and my bf Vince went to BlackFinn for Sunday lunch yesterday. The atmosphere was cool and it was really nice inside. The staff was pleasant as well, so I'm thinking \"hum...I like...\". We ordered  a couple of mojitos and we also had another drink, which was okay.  Time to order; I ordered the Cuban sandwich, hold the mustard, and add mayo instead....with Black Finn fries and my bf ordered the Prime Rib sandwich with au jus and the same fries.  We got our order, which took a bit of time but it was okay. Everything looked so yummy and I knew they were going to meet my expectations. Now mind ya, my bf put off going to BlackFinn since they day they opened and I've been on him to go here. So anyway, the fries were a bit salty, but good. I had a choice of two dipping sauces, which I believe were ranch and barbeque. Delicious! I bit into the sandwich and what did I taste? A mouth full of mustard!!! Eeewww!! Okay, did I not say \"hold the mustard\"? So lo and behold, my food had to be returned while my bf ate his food. His beef about his sandwich (no pun intended) was that there was more bread than meat. I looked at it and I noticed the same thing. Also, the au jus was a bit low as well and wasn't enough for the sandwich.  So I'm like the little old lady from the back-in-the-day commercials saying \"Where's the beef?\" LOL. Wow! \n\nFinally, after he finishes his sandwich, my food finally comes out and guess what? They left the swiss cheese off the sandwich. WTF! Okay, so at this point I'm like \"forget it, just take it back.\" How many times must I send my sandwich back to get it right? Now I must say that the manager on duty was accommodating and she took care of the check and apolgized for the errors. So for her professionalism and the fact that the staff was very polite, I give them two stars. Will I go back....yes I will give them another chance to redeem themselves, but all in my ear is my bf saying that there must have been a reason why he hesitated to come here and this is why.  Oh well......",

  "text": "Almost $4 for a slice of pizza??\n\nI went to NY Pizza after a Mardi Gras parade last week. (Price gouge much?) The woman at the counter presented us with two options for individual slices: pepperoni and spinach. We asked why we couldn't see any green on top of the spinach pizza and she told us \"The spinach is under the crust\" (spoiler alert: there was no spinach!). The service was prompt, despite them being busy, and we paid and left. Within ten steps of leaving the front door, the cheese on the \"spinach\" slice slid off the bread and fell to the ground. Granted, I think this is probably in part due to the pizza-holder, but cheese should never slide off a pizza that easily. What a waste of $4. I won't be back.",

We walked in the restaurant and were seated at a table by the bar immediately.  There were two people at the bar and two other tables seated.  The host (may have also been our server) asked us what we wanted to drink.  Ten minutes later, the same man came back to our table, told us he had a \"brain fart\" and forgot what we ordered to drink.  We politely gave him our drink order again, and after at least five more minutes, we still hadn't seen him again, and we left.  The bartender, who walked past us at least 3 times, was at the bar on her IPad about 3 feet away from us when we walked out.  We gave them a second chance, and we won't be back.  We each have at least 20 years of restaurant experience, so we understand what service should be, and there are too many other choices to give this place another shot.",

  "text": "I have to start out by saying, why do those who like hookah not know about this place?! It was such a wonderful experience! Please hear me out!\n\nMy mission on this review is to get the word out! A friend and I went spur of the moment and I'm glad we did. From the outside of the building you wouldn't know it was a hookah bar (except the giant sign of course lol). The moment you open that giant wooden door, the decor and paint color gives it that authentic look. Warm yellow paint with evil eyes and giant metal wall lamps with cutouts shining red surrounding all the walls.\nWhen you go up a few steps there's a gift shop, a table, and the register. They ask you to take a seat upstairs and they follow you shortly after. (There's even another upstairs that I barely peaked at).\nThis is the amazing part: cushions on the floor with giant metal mandala tables!!!! It was so authentic I could barely handle my excitement. They have a menu with drinks, food and hookah. Water was only a dollar which was amazing because hookah bars are usually pretty pricy.\nWe smoked \"sex on the beach\" flavored shisha. It was smooth! Very smooth! We even brought bubbles for the trip to have a little fun :)\nWhat I like about this place compared to other loud hookah bars is that it wasn't even close to being hectic. I felt like I should have whispered at first, but after awhile I was more comfortable. Only one other couple was there and they were very nice to talk to as well. The older man and the young guy was extremely nice. The younger dude checked in on us and was sociable which was really kinda nice but not overbearing. \n\nIf you want a low key, quiet and chill hookah bar, this should be at the top of people's lists.",

This is a must stop if you're a sushi/Asian fusion fan. We look forward to seeing what's in store for Tuna Bar and are thrilled to have this a two minute walk away!",

My sister ordered a drink off the menu and 10+min later, as we're finishing our lunch, the waitress comes back and says \"sorry, our bartender doesn't know how to make that\" ..... So the bartender doesn't know how to make the drinks listed on the menu? And the 10+mins. it took to tell us that, it could have ben googled and made. I don't want to bash this establishment, but the customer service has always been an issue here. I would recommend continued training to both current and new staffers to improve their level of knowledge and customer service",

This family owned restaurant really makes you feel at home. \n\nWe started with some drinks and seafood apps. The clams in white were awesome! Perfect flavor and consistency. The broth was so good, I wanted to treat it as if it were soup. We also got some crabs to share, they were a good size and were warm and cleaned. \n\nI chose to get one of the specials, the Salmon, and WOW was I impressed. It was cooked so perfectly. A slight crunch on the outside (not burnt) and juicy on the inside. It was honestly the best salmon I ever had. There was a corn succotash on top and it came with orzo, because I can't have gluten I chose to sub broccoli. \n\nI am impressed with Dagwoods every time I come. They never fail to amaze and create a great experience weather it's your first time or you're a regular.",

All that changed last night when we were kept waiting over an hour for our food (the server explained they had a order come in for 45 pizza's) and people who had been seated 20 minutes after us were chewing away at their dinner. We also had to flag our waitress (older, petite, blondish hair) down to order more drinks after a 45 minute wait between beverages!!!! It was later on a Friday night, the dinner rush was over, but we still felt completely overlooked.  \nThe food is excellent, however my husband had the ribs (his usual) last night and he said they tasted phoned in. My lasagna was perfection and I'm glad I ordered it rather then my usual steak and potato. \nThe highlight is always the parkinglot. There is a Porsche GT3RS that always makes me smile and when I am able to park next to it in my Cayenne Turbo (yes, I know, I am not your typical woman...I love cars.) I imagine what it would be like to \"accidentally\" swap keys with whomever owns that car. \nWe will return, the food and normally, the service, is just too good to stay away.

  "text": "We took a break from Sesame Place and ate some real food here before heading back to Elmo for a final beating, aka: The Sesame Parade and Fireworks show. \n\nIf this wasn't the sweet haven of amazingness between furry monsters and sweat, I really cannot attest to what the heck a sweet haven is. \n\nI ate steak, delicious steak, instead of a grilled cheese at Elmo-Bites. Because I found out that Elmo can really bite. He is a monster after all. \n\nThe servers are so great with kids and yet you sit in that swanky dark mahogany bar atmosphere and feel like you are human again after a day at Sesame Place. I actually think JB DAWSON's is the reason we went back after our dinner. I downed my steak and two beers, looked at my adorable 3 year old who was quietly coloring on the kid menu they have, turned to my husband and said, \"Wanna be parents of the year, and take her back to see the parade?\" Swiftly, he responded, \"Let's do it. Go big or go home.\"\n\nAll the waitstaff works together here too. I don't know if they pool tips, but it's like some sorta family feeling they give you as if the waitress' big brother just took over her shift so she could go help mom in the kitchen. So rare to find fast, efficient, and dependable hosting like that in a restaurant these days. \n\nBeing from New York City and eating at an array of places over the years (with plenty of annoyed waitstaff), this place reminded me of Gorgios of Gramercy in terms of atmosphere and service. And it was child friendly which always scores well with me.\n\nMy only constructive criticism: my newborn has a dairy allergy and an overwhelming majority of the dishes and sides have butter, milk, or cheese in them. They made me a beautiful plate of steak, but all the higher priced sides I was supposed to get, I could not have. So I paid the same amount for two less filling sides....basically steamed broccoli (which was actually amazing) and fries. An additional side of something small like corn or rice, would have made it even-steven. But I loved my meal. I'd go back.",

  "text": "Eh. As others were saying, the design is pretty bad. It took an hour to get out of the parking garage. Elevators take forever, so we took the stairs, just to be greeted by a locked door.\n\nI'm sure there are varying opinions on this, but I'm in the boat with the people saying I thought D&B was Chuck E Cheese for adults. Little kids everywhere. I don't mind gaming with teenagers, but there were probably 100 toddlers in this place. There's people with strollers taking their infants. People, please go to Chuck E Cheese.\n\nI guess there's an any-age policy at the whole chain, it's just not what I was expecting. If anything, they should make it adults-only (or at least 13+) on weekdays and maybe open it up to all on weekends. I know that banning kids would cut into their customer base, but this makes older people not want to go, so pick your poison. I thought adults were the target market but that's not even close to the truth.\n\nAs far as the games, I didn't see anything for more than two players. I don't know how arcade games have evolved in the past 20 years, but way back in the day you could play some with four. \n\nThe best I saw was a downhill ski racing game, where you stand on it and steer with your feet. Cold air in your face for added effect. \nThe Walking Dead game was pretty cool. Kind of weird to have a crossbow that you reload instantly with 8 shots at a time. ....but I guess they're not going for realism in a zombie game. It's just a license for marketing, it's a generic zombie game. No show or comic characters. I don't care either way, it's not a bad game.\nThere's a racing game that takes a picture of your face before the race, and is connected to other machines at other locations. My friend and I were in tears laughing at this, since we would pick out a victim at the start of the race and try to ruin their day by running them off the road and making sure they lose. We just picked whoever looked most likely to cry.\n\nThere are plenty of bad games to make up for the good ones, but overall I actually had fun. Not sure if I'll be returning unless I find time to go when school is in session. However, I guess that wouldn't stop two year-olds from being there.",

We brought a bottle of tequila for margaritas and I am almost certain the waitress stole a nice amount of it, (the bottle was returned with 1/6th left and we only had two pitchers) and the two waitresses were acting drunk when we left.

  "text": "An upscale mexican joint? Really?! I enjoy good authentic mexican food, this is by far the most upscale Ive seen.  Im more of the food trucks and hole in the walls type, so this was different than what Im used to. \n\nThe atmosphere at Besito is tough to beat. They have Merengue & Salsa on the background which doesn't really go with the Mexican theme but who's paying attention. An ideal Date night atmosphere for sure. \n\nFood here is fantastic. A little pricey, but you get your money's worth. You have the ($3) valet outside, great service, waiters have always been friendly and happy to discuss the menu, Besito more than met our expectations. \n\nIf you love Mexican food, and feel like taking it to another level for once, Besito is your place. It's a gourmet mexican restaurant, certainly worth trying.",

The meatloaf sandwich for $9.50 was two meals, and the special 8oz Angus burger was perfectly cooked and flavorful for only $6.  Our side was the prime rib mac and cheese and we shared a 2-4-1 hard cider since happy hour stars at 11am.  Chrissy was our server and you should definitely ask for her.  She knows the menu, she is efficient, keeps the drinks filled and nearly sold us on dessert even though we were just too full.  We will be back again for sure!  Hump day has 1/2 price appetizers too...Check out this local gem!",

  "text": "My first time trying Indian. I would say my neutral rating is due to the service. The waitress didn't introduce herself or any specials and didn't  explain the menu it was just a \"what do you want.\" We guessed and picked a few things, they were good. Then when the bill came she put it on the table and in under a minute came back and picked it up before we even looked at it. Waitress then said \"how are you paying\" I felt awkward because we hadn't pick it up and it was a first date and she put the bill in front of me. I was hoping my date would be chivalrous, and he was but it was uncomfortable with the waitress coming back picking it up and seeing we didn't put a card in the book yet , because we weren't ready and she kept putting the bill back down, in front of me! This happened about three times. In my prior service experience you put the check in the middle, not in front of one person especially the lady of a date. Unsure if I'll go back.",

I think this is my all time favorite burger. I read many negative reviews about how long it takes to get your food. And I guess they listened and have improved . Our food came in a very respectable time. Also very good service and was seen to within minutes.  I give this place a two thumbs up. Oh and ask for extra napkins cause they are one juicy and messy hamburger..",

Wow, that was a huge order! They could have been heated a little more, but I can't complain otherwise.\nFor my entree, I went with my personal benchmark, Chicken Fried Steak. The portion was huge, and I'm pretty sure it was hand-breaded, and likely in their fried chicken breeding. This is a GOOD thing. In addition, it came with two sides. Green beans were delicious and bacony, and the 4-cheese Mac and Cheese was good...and a little kick of heat!\nOverall, this isn't fine dining by any stretch. But it's good basic homestyle.\nI will return...if I ever stop feeling so stuffed!!",

The server Megan  was really fast and nice. The breakfast menu has a great variety. They have vegan and gluten free options if you prefer. I order the French toast with a side order of their chicken sausage. The portion size was larger than I expected and very affordable. I think my plate was around 8-10 because I added the sausages. The French toast is probably the best French toast that I have ever tasted so if you love French toast you will defiantly not be disappointed!!!",

  "text": "Bully's all have the sports bar theme and they all have a plethora of TV's all playing different sports channels; there really isn't much else to say about the atmosphere but then again atmosphere isn't really why people go to Bully's.  I stopped in with my gal pals to take advantage of their happy hour which includes $3.50 screwdrivers and bloody Mary's, which are massive and not light on the liqueur.  We all ordered off of the happy hour menu which had 16 options for $6 dollars apiece.  Their regular menu is also massive so there is sure to be something to satisfy just about anyone. \n\nWe ordered zucchini sticks and jalapeno popper for appetizers.  There wasn't really anything special about the jalapeno poppers; there was no spice to them at all.  I'm the type that likes my stuff mild but this was no spice at all!  The zucchini sticks were good and I liked the size, they were more like a big French fry size which made them easier to share.  The zucchini wasn't especially impressive but anything deep fried is usually good.\n\n I ordered the beef sliders with a salad.  Two of my girlfriends got the chicken fingers and another got the chicken Philly.  Mine was certainly the best presentation; it was the best part about the meal too.  My sliders were served on Hawaiian rolls which were good but the patties were actually one hamburger patty cut into four pieces which I thought was really lame... If you're going to serve a slider at least make individual patties for it or don't even bother.  The hamburger was also really dry and had to be doused in mayo and ketchup in order to be eaten without choking.  The salad was good.  My girlfriends that got the chicken fingers were happy with them but I could tell that they probably came frozen and all Bully's did was fry them.  The chicken Philly was definitely the least impressive meal; the chicken was left in huge, tough, chunks and there was mention of quite a bit of gristle which is a deal breaker for me.   My friend picked at it a little but ended up eating hardly any of it.\n\nThe service was fine overall; no extra points for great service and no deducts for bad service either.  I would recommend going to Bully's for the great drink specials.  If you are going to get food stick with anything fried; Bully's doesn't get any extra points for being special or unique. The food had a good price but I can't say I would want to pay more than $6.00 for it.\n\nIf you want to see any other places I've reviewed check out my blog at: http://jparkhurst07.wordpress.com/",

  "text": "We were looking for a hands-on class instead of just a cooking demonstration.  We got exactly what we were looking for (and more) with Chef Bond. The description on his website was exactly what we got.  Several other reviews have covered the main points of the class.  \n\nIn short - we had a great time and highly recommend the class.  It was one of the highlights of our few days in New Orleans.  It was a fun, laid back, way to spend an afternoon.  Learned a few things.  Created and ate some great food.  If you're on the fence, definitely do it.\n\nWe attended a Sunday class that started at 11:00 AM.  The first ferry is at 11:00 AM on Sunday and the trip over only took a few minutes.  (Ferry tip: the fare is $2 per person each way.  Bring *exact change*.)  \n\nI'd recommend calling him on the way so he knows you are arriving.\n\nWe ate a late breakfast before the class and that worked great.  Keep in mind that it takes a while to cook everything, so don't expect to eat until late afternoon.  You don't want to be cooking while you are starving.\n\nMy wife has a couple of food allergies and we let him know in advance.  Chef made some adjustments to accommodate, although he wasn't able to eliminate the allergens completely.  (We understood.  It's difficult when you aren't used to it.)\n\nWe did read the reviews here before booking.  So glad we didn't let the one negative opinion keep us from having a good time.",

  "text": "Terrible, terrible service. Entitled hipsters who confuse orders, give attitude, and ruin customer's experience. The new manager is also frumpy and has awful music taste; think awful 50s - 80s rock/reggae music that's disappeared for a reason, but blared close to full volume. Softer, more neutral music would be greatly appreciated. Terrible consistency with orders too, they don't have consistent standards with coffee etc.\n\nCustomers are mostly Penn students, business types who interact with the school (recruiters from NYC etc) and visitors to the area. It's almost as if the staff feel some kind of insecurity or have pride issues serving almost always polite patrons. \n\nGelato is pretty good and coffee is pretty good but can be sloppily made (I.e mix your own iced latte). Also slimmed down portion sizes and got rid of the bar. The place has a great location and nice open feel to it, but so much potential is lost because of really shitty staff with terrible attitudes. So many frequent customers but the staff make no effort to get to know them (and trust me, they try). I can't emphasise enough how much the staff and manager need to change.",

Do yourself a favor and skip your kids recital, blow off that friend you've been playing phone tag with for weeks... but don't bring your friend who's all like \"are these gluten free vegan fries?\"... get some of their seriously awesome beers, a burger, maybe start off w some of their mac and cheese?

  "text": "We came here for dinner on the recommendation of a friend of a friend, who loves it and has been here multiple times.  We liked the idea of ordering a bunch of small plates to share.  It didn't disappoint--everything was delicious and lovingly presented.  We ended up ordering the goat cheese and basil bruschetta (mild but tasty); figs stuffed with blue cheese and served over prosciutto (rich and pungent); calimari (which I didn't try); fennel sausage (tender and flavorful); two of the cheeses (one was an amazing triple creme; can't remember the other one); and the chocolate torte.  The cheeses (which are listed on a separate part of the menu--make sure not to overlook them!) are served with sliced bread and are paired with various toppings.  Ours came with fresh honey and some kind of tapenade.       \n\nIt's somewhat pricey but not exorbitant, which we had anticipated.  The bill came to $80 for five small plates, a cheese board with two cheeses, and two glasses of wine (i.e., a moderate amount of food for dinner for two people).  You could obviously tweak this depending on your appetite, your budget, or your mood.  It would be a great place to just drop in for a snack. \n\nWe ate at one of the cafe tables on the sidewalk, which made for a really pleasant evening.  The service was good but was attentive to the point of being slightly overbearing.  But on the whole this was a very fine meal.  Thank you!",

  "text": "Worth the cruise down the river, but do NOT bother with any of their food promotions.\n\nLook, it's not a boat from the 1800's or anything like that. I believe it was built in the 70's or something. But you're in New Orleans, and these boats are a big part of the history and you should experience it to the fullest.\n\nAs a short 2-2.5 hour cruise, even as a local, it is worth the money. You can sit, stand, walk all over most parts of the boat, enjoy the sights and listen to the narrator. It's nice. They even serve drinks. VERY OVERPRICED drinks, but.... c'mon.\n\nDon't bother with the food. For a seriously pricey premium you can take the cruise and get a lunch or dinner. I went on the Jazz lunch one time and it was just... meh. I was expecting a live jazz band playing some dixieland while I ate some etouffee or jambalaya or other staples like that. What I got was a piano player droning out modern day boring Kenny G jazz and a buffet of bland mediocre \"New Orleans syle\" food. SERIOUS waste of money. There are literally a dozen restaurants where you can eat in the immediate vicinity of the vessel, so WAIT and eat there. \n\nBut like I said, the actual cruise is nice. I tell people to at least check it out all the time. Even if you LIVE here, you should check it out every now and then. \n\nI think they offer a cruise down to the Zoo. I'd like to try that.",

  "text": "Of course we know it is not Las Vegas, but per Tripadvisor figured it would be worth going. To sum it all up, it's a castle of secondhand smoke!  We are non smokers and have gone out to clubs which had smoking and could tolerate it more than this place!\n\n We were very disappointed that we could not enjoy ourselves for all the smoke. Soon as some hit the door, they were lighting up cigs. SMH.. Why not invest in some of  those high power fans to vacuum some of this smoke out??? We were not the only patrons cutting our visits short because of this. \n\nNice looking hotel and heard the buffet was delicious, yet sadly we will never know... Doubt we will  ever come back unless it changes to non-smoking or clear divisions of smoking and non-smoking areas. Oh well, can not win them all. Maybe if some happy competition moves in town, things would be interesting.",

  "text": "We were feeling hungry after a long day and decided to have dinner with family and friends at BK's. We are seated promptly and our waitress took our drink and appetizer order.  A short time later,  our drinks and appetizers arrived. The drinks were great and the guac with chips was fantastic.   \n\nOur waitress took our dinner order and we patiently waited for our food.  The waitress checked on us frequently and kept us pretty hydrated.  As time passed,  we noticed that the restaurant was delivering food to tables that were seated after us and even sat new customers after those folks left and feed them too!\n\nWe asked our waitress, what's going on with our food? She replied,  \"hasn't the manager been out to talk to you?\"  We said, \"no\" and our waitress said, \"I will ask her again to come out and talk to you.\"  A short time later, a young lady came out and brought us complimentary guacamole and warm chips and said this is for waiting on the food.  \n\nWe waited a long time before we saw our waitress again.  When she came by she asked if we had talked to the manager. After we stated we hadn't, she proceeded to call the manager again and check on our food.\n\nWhen the manager arrived at our table, it was the same lady who brought the chips and guac! She was very unpleasant and never provided any explanation other than it was busy and the steaks were frozen when we ordered them. Okay...let me apologize for my party ordering the t-bone steaks and for me ordering the cabreria. \n\nWe explained that no one ever mentioned a delay or asked if we wanted to change our order which we could have done hours ago. She pretty much just walked away like no big deal if you are not happy. \n\nAt least lie to me and say you ran out of some main ingredient and had to run to the store. Bring out the food that is ready and feed the antsy children on the table.  Very disappointed with how she handled the situation or I guess how she didn't handle it.\n\nThe food finally came out. I would like to give zero stars for the manager but food and micheladas were still great even though it took hours to arrive. \n\nBTW, the cabreria was fantastic.  \n\nThere was a time when i thought that Bk's competitor was better than this restaurant but over the years the competition started sacrificing their quality and customer service.  I hope that this isn't happening to this restaurant.",
