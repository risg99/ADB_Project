I like that this place can accommodate large families or birthday parties like for kiddos, but they also have a bar in the back. There are TVs all around playing different games which is also nice. There is a tiny arcade in the back too. We shall definitely be back!",

  "text": "A tour guide perfectly described the difference between Bourbon Street and Frenchman Street. Bourbon Street is for drunks, drag queens, and prostitutes. Frenchman Street is where the music is. I highly recommend Three Muses, which is a gastropub on the street. The food is incredible. The mac and cheese is amazing. The cheese it uses is great and the dish comes out sizzling hot. Once I started eating it, I could not stop till I finished it. I have the dish ranked as good as any mac and cheese I have tried. It is in a tie with Beechers (locations in New York and Seattle). The pork belly and \"Banh mi\" Gulf Fish Tacos are excellent. The lamb sliders and sweet potato gnocchi with Louisiana crab are very good too.\n\nOf course, Three Muses also has live jazz performances. The music is fantastic. I arrived at the gastropub ten minutes before it opened so I could get a seat at the bar immediately. It was a Sunday night and it still got busy for dinner in a hurry.\n\nIf you are visiting New Orleans and looking for recommendations, feel free to message me through Yelp and I can share my itinerary, which includes my Yelp reviews. The information for an electronic copy can also be found via my Yelp profile.",

  "text": "This was a fun place to visit for a light dinner and some great entertainment with the kiddies! We caught a band called Washboard Rodeo, and they played some fun bluegrassy-type western swing. We'd made a 7:30 reservation via Open Table and were seated immediately. It's a small place, so any table you get is a good one. This is one of the few places on Frenchman Street that seems okay for children: mine are 9 and 11 and very capable of behaving well in a gastropub setting. The menu has a great baked mac & cheese and the waitresses are warm and welcoming. I have to say, after sampling the fish tacos, I sorta wish that I had ordered the mac & cheese, too! The tacos were okay but small and pretty bland. The mac & cheese was plentiful and well-seasoned. But this place is all about the music and the drinks, and on these they won me over. Had a simple Stella Artois apple cider (despite the great drink selection) and hubby enjoyed his porter. If you make a reservation, they give you 90 minutes to dine, which to me was more than enough. The band starts at 7pm on a weeknight, taking a 15-minute break around 8pm, and our 7:30 reservation gave us plenty of time to enjoy the music. If you visit New Orleans with older kiddies, I'd say give this place a go.",

When I was last here half a year ago, I was less-than-impressed, but this time, the staff was friendlier and the ramen was close to perfect.\n\nWe came for a late lunch, minutes before they were supposed to close at 3pm. The waiter still good-naturedly accommodated us, providing fast and attentive service. \n\nThe noodles were chewy, and whereas last time they were a little clumpy, this time, they were perfect. The broth was not too salty and somehow managed to be full flavored and (refreshingly) light at the same time. The meat was meltingly tender, though a little broken-up for my tastes, and the soft-cooked egg was perfect.\n\nWe also ordered a special grapefruit juice, whose tart flavor complimented the ramen and served nicely as a palate cleanser.\n\nAfter eating ramen, I often fall into a sodium stupor and feel mildly ill for at least half a day, but after Cheu ramen, I felt pleasantly full. The attentive service and delicious ramen made for a much-improved experience.",

  "text": "Good food and for a chain very good food. It lived up to its reputation of serving fresh food. I give it three stars instead of four mainly because it's probably not on my top 10 places in Reno for Mexican food. Chipotle is not even my favorite Mexican-themed chain restaurant. That would be El Pollo Loco.\nFor my meal I got a burrito with beef, black beans, white rice, sour cream, cheese, lettuce and maybe some other stuff. I added a patrone margarita and a bag of chips with what they described as their hottest sauce.\nI had to wait about a month to try the place because the lines were so long the previous times I came. The staff was friendly when I placed my order. I got my burrito, chips and salsa when I paid and the maragarita came a few minutes later.\nChipotle failed to live up to the hype with my first bite of food. The chips are good quality chips. The salsa tastes mass produced. It was supposed to be their hottest salsa but it had a streak of that sweet ketchup flavor some shows up in salsas some times. My favorite salsas are the red salsa from the Michoacan region of Mexico with its nice garlic kick. \nThe ingredients in the burrito were fresh, but there were two significant flaws. No. 1 is that the rice overwhelmed everything else. Usually if one ingredient overwhelms a burrito it seems it is the beans, but not in this case. It made the burrito bland and a little dry. The second flaw was all the gristle I found on the beef. My tray had more than a half dozen chunks of inedible meat on it by the time I finished. I decided to spare Yelpers a photo of that.\nThe margarita was okay. I'd get one again but it was routine.\nThere's basically two kinds of wine bars: Those that serve wine that wine geeks like (these are the ones that have the hardest time surviving) and those that are a place where women feel safe to drink. I get the sense that Chipotle is a Mexican restaurant designed to make gringos feel safe to eat there.  Again, for a chain, they serve good quality food. I can get better food for less money at a half dozen taquerias around town. \nChipotle is a smoke jalapeno used in cooking. For people who have never had a good chipotle in a Mexican restaurant, I would suggest trying the camarones ala diabla (devil shrimp) at La Fuente in Sparks. It's quite a bit spicier than the hot salsa served at Chipotle but it has great depth of flavor.",

Philly is lucky to be one of those three cities! \n\nThe bar melds perfectly inside the restaurant and does not make you feel like it is the \"bar\" area. Tables fill this room for dining or having a cocktail. One step up and to the side is an elevated floor, where we sat.  Beyond the \"bar\" area that you walk into, is a more secluded dining area, but we were center stage and had a great view of it all. \n\nHubby and I ordered and shared three appetizers. We loved them all, but I was partial to the escargot and the oysters Rockefeller and he to the clams casino, so I did not mind letting him finish the clams while I devoured the other two appetzers. We did skip salads, but hubby enjoyed the wonderful lobster bisque, of which I found exceptionally good, with my one snitched spoonfull. \n\nMy husband had the Prime Rib, what else? I love filet mignon and they have in house made bearnaise sauce, so I stuck with what I love best and it was a huge, juicy and tender portion, very good indeed. \n\nThe restaurant has a lot of class and prices are what you would expect. \n\nWhat I loved most about the service, for such an upscale establishment, the wait staff was not at all uptight. The waiters were professional, but with charisma and humor and knew how and when to have conversation. \n\nBottom line, I would go back in a heartbeat!\n\nWheelchair accessible with ramp through main entrance into the lobby of the hotel and entrance right in through their door.",

It's smaller than  the supercentre but I find it has a decent selection of items in the food section where the prices are cheaper than the nearby stores.  The produce section can have limited items though with just the basics in stock.  I find the snacks and canned food section are fine with good prices.\n\nAs for the rest of the store and items, well it's hit or miss.  I was looking for lightbulbs and they only had one brand of the type I was looking for and it was a energy efficient so pricier than others if they had in stock.  However, the price I paid for the item was probably cheaper than other stores.  \n\nDon't expect much help if you need help finding an item.  Associates seem to be difficult to find unless you count some of the younger staff who like racing shopping carts in the store as they were on my last visit.  \n\nThe check outs can have at most 5 cashiers working but I find the time in the line ups is never too long so that's good.",

Richard, our waiter told me (confidentially per him) that he could give me the 8 oz lobster tail for $24 along with the mashed potato side and my choice of broccoli or asparagus.  Chose the asparagus.  Chip\nOrdered the Berkshire pork chop with a pepper rub, mashed potatoes and asparagus.  My lobster was good, but no way was this tail 8 oz before cooking.  Chip's pork chop was a spectacle of gristle and fat.  Despite its huge size he probably got about a half portion due to the bad cut of meat.  His potatoes were pretty good. His asparagus were missing, but when he saw the sad little overcooked spears I received, he figured he'd pass.\n\nWhen Richard came back and asked if we wanted a box for the uneaten gristle and fat we told him it wasn't necessary and explained why.  To his credit, he apologized and removed the $15 charge for my glass of Groth Sauvignon Blanc, which we thanked him for and appreciated the gesture.\n\nWhen we got the bill I noticed that I was given an additional charge for the asparagus, even though that was not mentioned when he offered the choice of broccoli or asparagus.\n\nI should say that the house chopped salad, rolls and maple butter were delicious and that's what made me give 1200 two stars instead of one.\n\nAvoid at all costs.

I almost forgot dessert...an entire side of the room is dedicated to a table full of desserts AND a chocolate fountain. The brunch price also include bottomless mimosas which were literally bottomless. Our server never let us empty our glasses and  the mimosas were very heavy on the champagne, so we all got a bit tipsy. At least the alcohol let us forget how much weight we gained during this meal.\n\nAs if the buffet spread wasn't enough, they also have an a la carte menu with small dishes. The choices included Belgian waffles, french toast, blintzes, Mahi, and a few other savory dishes.  You can order as many of these items as you want, as many times as you want. Our server was sure to remind us of this, she seemed to enjoy watching how gluttonous our table was! \n\nUnfortunately we were here during Tropical Storm Debby, so we didn't get to enjoy a beautiful view of the bay, Although, being here while the weather was so awful was very cozy with the fireplace and wood interior. Thanks to the weather it wasn't crowded either, so don't write this place off on account of bad weather. \n\nAt $35 a person, the Sunday brunch seems pricey, but if you have no qualms about overeating and overdrinking, you'll definitely get your money's worth.",

It's not dirty, per se.  It just doesn't look very clean.  Everything looks like its falling apart.  It probably gets its business from suburbanites like me craving what we think of as Chinese food.\n\nAll that said, the food I had was palatable.  Nothing outstanding or amazing: it was just all right.  I won't recommend against it, but it's nothing that you would think of as that great either.",

  "text": "The service here is spectacular.  After we parked along the street nearby, I went in to ask if we could sit out on the patio and although the hostess was not spotted, I saw two staffers chatting at the bar area who immediately spotted me, so I asked them about sitting on the patio.  One of them said we could and apologized about not being up front at the restaurant when I walked in, which was totally fine with us.  He was very, very nice and allowed us to pick a table outside and got us menus before our server came out, which was shortly after.  And with the great service - our server was very nice and checked in with us about getting refills, getting more beers, bringing anything else, etc...  She also was well-informed about the menu when we would ask for specifics on items.\n\nUnfortunately though, I didn't like my burger as much as I had hoped.  I ordered the Taco Truck Burger, which came with guac, sour cream and tortilla chips on a burger, so sounded amazing!  But it wasn't something I'd order again, as I thought it was very bland - even with all of the jazzed up toppings.  It didn't taste like the patty was seasoned at all nor the guac, which was odd.  The sweet potato tots though were yummy.  I do like that instead of fries you can get tots, especially sweet potato tots.  I recommend getting the sweet potato tots with the garlic aioli that the server recommended for me when I asked if she could bring me an aioli to go with.  I just wished the burger had been more to my liking.  \n\nThey have some local beers on taps, and most are from the east coast.  Patio seating was spacious, looking out to the street/Gulch area and they have heated outdoor lamps there.",

Or maybe it was just because I had my own kitchen. \n\nAs an out-of-town visitor, I've tried it twice (10th and Walnut and the Chestnut St location), both times on a weekday morning on my way out of town. Both times the food hasn't lived up to the menu and has left me with regrets. On the most recent visit, which, I swear, will be the last, my croque monsieur was cold and my coffee sat empty. \n\nBut in both cases, I have to admit, the restaurant provided a nice, nearby, Center City brunchy-breakfast destination that got me on my way in good time.

  "text": "I thought this tour was phenomenal!!! We had originally booked our swamp tour with Dr. something or other and they were horrible so we jumped ship (no pun intended) and booked with Cajun Encounters. I am so glad that we did! \n\nWe opted to take the bus from NOLA and was glad that we did. Our driver was so-so and he attempted to give us a tour from town out to the dock but sadly it was lacking (this is why I am deducting half a star...you will see why the other half star deduction...just keep reading). I think there was a language barrier and that kind of sucked. Oh, and he was 30 minutes late. That was a little frustrating. We took the first tour so this meant I could have spent an extra 30 minutes sleeping. Boo!\n\nOnce we got there we checked in and it was rather chaotic (the other half star deduction). You walk in and see a long line for tickets. The bad thing was that it is in the center of the gift shop. That made shopping rather difficult. This is probably not a good thing for revenue. The dumb this was that there was a register in the back...which was closed! \n\nThe tour itself was great! Our guide was friendly and very knowledgeable. I really enjoyed him. He gave us a history of the swamp and offered tons of info about the elusive gators of the bayou. We saw a number of them and even got to hold a baby. How awesome is that? Let me tell you, it was pretty darn awesome! I highly recommend that you request a covered boat. The poor people with the open boat were sweating like you couldn't believe. I thought it was very interesting that we did not encounter one mosquito! Amazing! \n\nOverall, I highly recommend this tour! If we travel back to NOLA we will definitely be back!",

  "text": "Cajun Encounters ... matching tourists with gators since 19somethingsomething\n\nThey have a pickup route in NoLa so if one misses it, one can still get to a later stop and get on. Its a pretty comfortable ride to the swamp. You'll get to see (while in the shuttle bus) the abandoned Six Flags along the way.\n\nFair warning - BYOB. There is a little convenience shop where you pay fully for your ticket, but no booze. And the food gave some people stomach pains. But you can find various gator jerky. \n\nThere are modular bathrooms that flush and have running water.\n\nThe swamp tour is pretty cool, you get to go under one of the lift bridges (?, they don't draw up in the middle, but lift straight up via four gears). You'll see grass lands, swamp lands, old trees, houses on stilts, and maybe some swamp folk. If you're lucky, you'll see some animals and stuff. We saw a baby gator, a big gator, a tiny raccoon, an angry raccoon, an egret, and a heron. \n\nIt might drag on for a while so don't drink too much - you'll be dying for the bathroom. Fun! Definitely don't need to do it again.",

When I asked the server what's going on, she gave me a really bitchy attitude and acted as though she was talking to a child. She goes \"yeah like I said the kitchen is backed up.\" To which I said yes but not enough She did take them off the bill but her attitude was so off putting and condescending I didn't even care at that point. \n\nThe tacos still took another 15 min after that. \n\nAlso they have 2 different websites with different menus which is confusing.

  "text": "While walking around Bourbon Street, it's a little frightening to see white powder riddled on the streets and plastered on peoples' noses.  Because of that, you might suspect people are sniffing cocaine due to their boisterous attitudes, but after eating beignet's at Cafe Beignet on Bourbon Street, I'm convinced that they are the reason for such things. Lol\n\nCafe Beignet offers better beignets than Cafe Du Monde and it's not even close.  They're far more fluffy, soft, well-sized, and deliciously powdered than any beignet I've had and it's only $3.99 for three!\n\nCafe Beignet has two locations--one being this one inside Musical Legends Park on Bourbon Street and the other on Royal.  I much rather prefer the one on Royal as it has a more clean and endearing environment.  This specific location on Bourbon is more fun and lively, but the distasteful smells of Bourbon Street creeps in from time to time.  I do love the live jazz music that is played though.  \n----\nConclusion: Those who are looking for 5 star beignets and a lively, musical atmosphere, come to this outdoor location.  I, along with Mr. Alton Brown (famous food critic on the food channel) agree Cafe Beignet is much better than Cafe Du Monde.  Come here for food, alcohol, music, and the best beignets! can be found here too!  \n\nExtra Notes:\n-Accepts credit card\n-Tables are available but be aggressive when trying to obtain one.  There are three tables upstairs near the restroom too\n-Service can be better as they're not very friendly or helpful\n-Restrooms are filthy",

Fortunately, the tables are close together so we made friends with our neighbors, and ended up sharing our bounty with them.  Ha.  \n\nMost things were really good- we were starving though and waited over an hour to get seated.  The meat and cheese plate stands out.  I'm a sucker for cheese.  Other notable menu items are:  fried pickles (actually, they were amazing), french fries (sooo good), the lamb sliders weren't that good in my opinion, but the masses seem to like them (read in other reviews).  Something with mustard sauce, maybe egg rolls, or shrimp tempura were good- obviously, the condiment was the one that stood out to me.  That boolgogi bowl was really good too.  I think we had the mac and cheese too.  \n\nSo aside from this being a testimonial to me being a total cow- the main thing you should draw from this review is that, aside from the great music here, the food and drinks are good.  I think I stuck to wine because the cocktails were a little strange to me.  I'd go back.",
