Delicious drinks, a wide variety of coffees and tasty pastries make this a must see if you're in the neighborhood. The honor bar is great for those times you just want some coffee and need to get in and out in a hurry.",

  "text": "This place is cute and I enjoyed myself. The salon was beautiful and well kept, and the owner or manager desk person was a total delight and I would go back for lashes or just a pedi bc the pedi there was honestly incredible the tech had me in heaven. Also the prices were reasonable.\n\nBut the mani is just meh. I didn't really inspect my nails when I left bc I was in a hurry. It's just frustrating I can do my own nails better and paint all the way to the sides without leaving a gap. But toying with an at-home LED lamp is a pain.\n\nSo the nitty gritty: There are little bumps and bubbles. I had to pick clear and colored gel off my skin later and trim where it had pooled in cuticles with nail scissors. Several nails were filed slightly assymetrically. Also they do something called wrapping their tips with a extra layer so it's sealed under and looks kind bulbous on the nail, like thicker visibly and to the touch at the tips. \n\nThat being said the tech was super sweet and genuinely nice. But if I went again I would just stick to a pedi or request someone else for a mani.",

  "text": "Was on a mission trying to find the perfect coat for the Holidays. Found my idea of the perfect coat at Burlington but they did not have my size. Went to Target, bought a coat but ended up taking it bath. Was not my dream coat. Next stop Ross. The only coat in my size was a beautiful Bomber style jacket made of pleather. Bought it right before Christmas. Now it's a few days after Christmas and my husband Guy points out to me that the coat is really wrinkled. I go on line and look up every possible hack to get wrinkles out of pleather. They all fail miserably. I just went back to Ross with that coat, no receipt, no tags and asked to speak to the manager. The manager is a young male with dark hair and black framed glasses. I tell him of my plight. He literally says go find what you need, no problem. WOW! You won't believe it, but there was my Camouflage coat, in my size, hanging there waiting for me. Oh the irony! They exchanged my coat and after all that I ended up with my Dream coat after all. Thank you Ross Dress for Less. You will forever be my first choice for now on!",

Kudos to the mixologist - not everyone can consistently craft cocktails - at least in my extensive research.\nAlso various local draft beers were tried and a Bordeaux for good measure.\nApps of blackened shrimp and hominy hush puppies were tasty.  Dinner ranged from Blackened Red Fish Po'Boy served w/ Cajun chips, crab stuffed Missouri catfish to Shrimp & Grits. All were pleased with our choices and nothing remained once we were done. Dessert of Whiskey Caramel baked Alaska was shared.

They provide breakfast which I assume will be just ok but at least is free if that matters to you. The gym is pretty miserable. A depressing room with 3 elliptical machines, on bench and a few dumbbells. Pool is very unimpressive. \n\nHowever would stay again as we have kids and one room very comfortable for all.",

I wanted to try everything but had to control myself so I went for a tostada and and three tacos. \n\nThe service is super fast. As soon as we sat down, we were already given our waters and within 5 minutes, our food followed. Both dishes came out extremely fresh and hot. The tostada's ingredients were layered together to create a perfect bite. The beans, cheese, and vegetables complimented each other so well with the crispy base. The tacos weren't as impressive but they were still yummy. I wasn't a big fan of the corn tortillas because it was kind of bland and chewy. The carne asada meat was flavorful but the lengua (beef tongue) had an iron/gamey taste unlike most other Mexican places. The sauces that are given on the table were really flavorful, the red sauce had a smokey peppery taste while the green one (extremely hot) had a citrus/jalapeño like mixture. \n\nThe restaurant is very clean, has plenty of seating, and I definitely will be back to try the other menu items!",

We sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and helpful. \nIt was around 6 pm, so we reached for the happy hour menu (4-7 pm M-F).  Both my friend and I got the Tavern Jalapeño Margarita. I think this is my new favorite drink! Slightly spicy with charred lemon and unique deep flavor. Most importantly- not sweet! Perfection!\nWe shared the sandwich shooters. They are the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars. I had higher expectations. The tomato bisque was kinda bland, and the baguettes were not anything to write home about. For my main entree i had the Southwest bowl- delicious! Great flavors, generous portion and nice presentation. My friend got the district salad with salmon and she was very happy with her choice too. I'd definitely come back again for the jalapeño margarita and to try something else on the menu. \nTip-you can take the Downtowner to and from here!",

  "text": "This is the worst delivery experience I've ever had. I was a delivery driver for another Domino's for 5 years during college, so I know that things can get hectic, but this was ridiculous. Ordered online at 11:00pm, tracker said it would be delivered in 25-35 minutes. At 12:00am, the pizza had still not arrived so I called the store. They said mine was the next one out the door and should be there in a few minutes, because I live about 1 mile away from the store. At 1:00am, still no pizza. I call again and they said the driver left with my order and another order 30 minutes ago, and instead of driving to my house first, which was 1 MILE AWAY, he went to the other house first which was further away, and gave them their pizza AND MY PIZZA. They offered to make a new one and send it out, but I didn't want to wait up until 3 in the morning, so I said no thanks. They offered a free pizza on my next order, but that doesn't do anything to help me right now because it too late to order from anywhere else. This is why Uber Eats and other forms of food delivery will end up crushing stores like this. So to whoever runs this store, seriously, congratulations. You've just won the award for worst store in the franchise.",

Not to mention the lady who washed my hair massaged my head amazingly!I bought the pack of four and will definitely be going back.

You can earn rewards for visiting there. I paid with a card and everything was easy and receipt was sent to my phone. \n\nFood***You can order from cluster truck they deliver to the parking lot. 1st time ordering you get 10% off Cluster truck has a ton of food options. And the food is Fantastic. You order from an app and they accept Apple Pay too. The reason I focus on the food is because good beer is good beer, but having food too is rare. They also have a stage area for small concerts. I will go back!! Oh and the bathroom has to be one of the cleanest public bathrooms I've used.(just saying)",

I recommend grabbing a latte and a baked good to munch on while you wait. \n\nI've had few dishes I haven't loved.  I normally find it hard to narrow down the options, I normally ask the wait staff bc there always seems to be a few dishes that rise above the others. The sorghum bacon is always pretty impressive and a crowd pleaser and I've definitely ordered a few different versions of the Dutch baby. Happy brunching!",

  "text": "The husband had a hankering for Asian food so we decided to check out this new Thai restaurant based on the reviews. We were not disappointed. We started of with their pork & shrimp dumplings. They looked more like Shu mai which was different than what we expected but very delicious. They have 4 spice levels; mild, medium, hot, & Thai hot. They are not kidding around with how spicy their food is. Normally I order the Pad Thai the first time I visit a Thai restaurant but decided to try the spicier Garlic Beef at their medium spice level. It was delicious & perfectly spicy. The hubby got the Panang curry chicken, medium spice, & it was delicious & perfectly spiced too. The portion sizes were just right. We finished off our meal with their sweet, sticky rice with mango. OMG, it was the best I've ever had! They use the black rice & it was warm & drizzled with hot sweetened, condensed milk. The mango was perfectly ripe & there was more than 2-3 slices. We will definitely go back. The hubby wants to try something hot.\nAttention Vegans - they have a separate menu of dishes just for you!",

  "text": "First time at HS. It was difficult getting a reservation. It always is after great reviews from patrons and the most recent 3 star out of 4 from CL. HS really steps it up for Collingswood. Once inside if you close your eyes one would think they were in a major city in the US. Love the open kitchen. Beautiful inside and out. Now for the food. Kale salad with hazelnuts was fantastic. Even if you don't like kale you will love this. Next the octopus. Perfectly done and one of the best I have tasted. This next dish they hit it out of the park and should make it permanent on the menu. Pasta cups with red meat gravy aka bolognese sauce. It was so good and had a little spice to it. And last a table share of a pork shoulder that they crisped up which was fantastic. Believe it or not our friends made a reservation for this Wednesday so we can't wait to go back. Staff was great and steered us in the right direction for ordering. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!",

The flavors of the curries and other stews are simply delicious; they are doing everything right with what seemed like very authentic tastes and aromas. Now here is my particular issue: this restaurant chooses to curry salmon. It is my fault, really, as I should have asked what fish was to be used in the curry fish dish. Had I known it was salmon I would have passed. Salmon is not a fish for curry, in my opinion. With that said, please note that this is a rather personal opinion and is based completely on the one issue. The restaurant is clean and the service provided is that from good people, no qualms on those points.",

Right from the fish tank in the cooking pot on your plate. Don't expect a fancy restaurant with a nice ambiance because this is not the reason you come here (though the outside seating has a nice ocean/harbor view). It is the variety of fresh shellfish prepared according to your appetite and taste buds. The wait can be long during peak hours but it is worth it.

Sweet potato fries were good. \n\nToday while at lunch with a group of colleagues the most disturbing thing happened. I noticed the manager in a green sweater lingering around the entrance and then two cop cars with lights flashing pulled up and 3 officers rushed in walked to the table next to us that the manager was pointing to and one of the officer's proceeded to pull out their handcuffs and tell the guy delivering food to put food down at the table and hands behind his back. They escorted him near the front door and had him sit down for a moment before taking him outside in freeZing cold with no jacket where he stood for a few minutes while cops came in and out of restaurant. \n\nThis entire thing was poorly handled, disturbing and unsettling not only to the customers but the other staff. They should have had the cops walk back away from where customers were and deal with it there. Then all the managers disappeared not available to talk to any of the customers let alone apologize or acknowledge people being unsettled. \n\nNo one needs to know why the arrest happened but there needed to be more care for customers and staff in how it was handled. \n\nNot ok!!!",

I'm well aware of the several Sahm's locations, the Big Lug brewery, and recent acquisition of Bent Rail in South Broad Ripple, but this was my first time at Roost, despite working in the area for over 10 years. \n\nDuring an early errand run with my daughter, I checked the area for a breakfast spot. I was reminded of this spot I've passed dozens of times, on the SE corner of Allisonville and 116th. We were seated quickly and greeted by a festive woman donned in sparkles and a Santa hat. \n\nAs with other locations, they had specials, in addition to a full breakfast & lunch menu. I ordered a scramble and bacon that came with hash browns and an order of biscuits and gravy and toast. Z got an omelet with a side of fruit and a waffle. \n\nThe portions were large and the hash browns were just the way I liked them. The gravy was a bit on the runny side, but not terrible. \n\nThere's a breakfast 'bar' that several people were seated around and the restaurant filled up quickly while we were there. \n\nWhile they don't serve cocktails, its a perfect spot for a family meal.

He told us that once furniture was delivered it would be harder to return; however, he didn't say it couldn't be returned--just harder. When I called to tell Joe two of the furniture pieces weren't going to fit and we needed to exchange, he said \"oh, let me talk to customer service and call you back.\" I let two days pass and called him back since he didn't return my call. The person that answered phone asked if they could give Joe a message, I said yes, that they could tell him I wanted him to call me back like he said he was going to do. Within 2 minutes my phone was ringing, but it wasn't Joe. I think she said her name was Madilyn, not sure. She said that she was just calling to tell me there are no returns or exchanges. I told her that Joe had said it was hard and the paperwork just says Ashley reserves the right to refuse returns but it doesn't say they won't. She proceeded to rudely and condescending ly say that she could read the paper to me. I told her thanks but I know how to read. \n\nIt's sad that some Ashley employees in Clearwater Florida are rude and intentionally mislead what would have been ongoing customers. Our home is new and we need more furniture. However, we will now look for a more reputable company to give our money to. Hope it was worth it smiling Joe and condescending customer service person",

My friend asked for bolognase sauce on the lasagna which was a great addition. Do it. \n\nThe hostess is great also - ask her for recommendations she's very passionate about the food there and is really funny/nice. \n\n. The meatballs are good but a little dry/too beefy. The sauce is good too but on the sweet side so it's something u have to be in the mood for.

  "text": "Hrm. I HATE to bad mouth a place which is obviously a small business and in a super competitive market. But this order was .... problematic. \n\nListen, they totally got the basics and cheaply too. Pork fried rice, excellent.  Crab Rangoon,  over cooked, but fine. In fact, anything premise and deep fried was exactly as you'd expect.\n\nBut the award winning Whole Chicken Pad Thai is just one giant green pepper disguised as noodles and nuts. It's not just bell peppers -- it's spicy hot, even though it wasn't marked that way -- and they marked half the menu as spicy.\n\nI bought $50 worth of variety and opportunity,  but I'm left wishing I'd stuck to the super boring stuff you can get anywhere.  *sigh*",

  "text": "I wish I could give Moto 3.5 a stars, because it really wasn't a bad meal. It just wasn't a standout meal. My husband and I went to Moto on a date night, not a special occasion. I enjoyed my glass of Sangiovese, and my husband enjoyed his cocktail. He had a pasta dish with a creamy tomato sauce and sausage, which was good, but tasted like a rather pedestrian Italian pasta dish. Take away the pretty dishes and beautiful table, and I think it was just about as good as any other creamy tomato pasta with sausage dish. My entrée was a black bucatini with seafood. The bucatini was good, and sauce was appropriately light and spicy. And the shrimp was pretty well cooked - something that does not happen all the time in Nashville. But the pasta was light on seafood. When lobster is listed on the menu, I want to see and taste the lobster! We also got a half order of the grilled artichoke hearts, which were very well cooked. We shared a dessert, a spicy peanut tart, which was interesting. The restaurant is beautiful, very modern, very hipster Nashville, very dark. The service was great. Really, truly - everyone was very helpful and nice and informed about the menu. So, it really wasn't a terrible meal. But it wasn't one of the better Italian meals I've in Nashville. And I didn't leave very pleased with the meal overall. Good, not great.",

I waited 20 mins to get my water, and another 10 mins to place the order, and yet another 20 mins to get the food. I went there twice. Both time, I experience good food + slow services. \n\nWill I come again? Well, maybe. I will make sure I sit inside or near the door at porch so that servers could see me.",

  "text": "AWFUL. I have been there more than once, and it was never great but ok. However the most recent time we went was the WORST EXPERIENCE I have ever had at a restaurant. We were sat and no one ever came to our table, I had to go get them, she got us the wrong appetizer, the food was awful and cold, everything took forever even though the restaurant was empty!!! The waitress was just terrible, I had to go find her several times. We almost got up and left and I wish we had! At the end of it our check was wrong and I never complain but when I did finally talk to the manager she didn't even care and did nothing about it. She didn't apologize or offer any kind of restitution. On our way out I did see that waitress was eating at a table, that would explain why she never came to ours!",

  "text": "I do not get the Surrey's hype at all. It was an incredibly mediocre meal. \n\nWe were told a 40-minute wait around 10:45 on a Friday morning. We waited over an hour (aren't hosts supposed to overestimate wait times, not under?).\n\nThe wait wasn't worth it. For a place that boasts about their homemade breads, it's shocking they don't have better than smuckers jelly packets to pair with their baked goods. The shrimp and grits was good but not great, and the bread served with it was legitimately bad. Dry, crusty, literally just stale slices adorning the plate. My partner got a breakfast burrito - it was meh, nothing special.\n\nI got a juice given their namesake and it tasted like concentrate!!!! It was a special, orange-pineapple-mango. I would not get a juice unless you're looking for a glass of sugar.\n\nBad. Skip. Go to Willa Jean's for a far superior/tastier breakfast experience.",

The wait is endless, no one is available to help and at Christmas time getting a gift wrap is act of God that requires endless wait. I bought gifts and knew that the wait for wrapping would be long SO I even left my items at the store to be gift wrapped at their leisure. They were not even moved from the counter where I bought them when I returned almost two hours later ready for pick up. This was a gift that needed to be given and The staff COMPLETELY \"dropped the ball\" on my time constraints! \n\nI love their stuff, but today was my last shopping experience at this location: couldn't get a gift wrapped after being assured that it could be done in a timely fashion???  I'll  cancel my card, do everything online and try not to go there if I can. It's really a shame!",

Two things  made our experience top notch. First was out waiter Eric, who was friendly, observant, went out of his way to get odd requests, and quick to getting back to us.  Eric is the type of waiter you would find a quality sit down restaurant.  The other were the 2 people at the grill house station. When I asked to have shrimp not basted due to a pepper allergy that offered to get different tings to remove them from the grill. I appreciated their thoughtfulness.",
