The restaurant is located just outside the French Market on Frenchman St, in a lower-key, musically-influenced area of town.

They use only Louisiana oysters and because of the oil spill in the Gulf, they cannot serve any dishes with oysters.  Boo.\n\nI subbed in a fish (catfish, I assume) po' boy instead and it was delectable.  It had catfish, shredded lettuce, slices of tomato, mayo, and pickles, inside a loaf of French bread.  With a side of fries, it was yummy and filling.\n\nSmall note on the fries: the menus have printed the fries are only $1.50 extra when ordered with a po' boy.  However, the restaurant charged us $2.00 and the server told us there was a sign out front that noted the change.  The menus still say $1.50 though.  The restaurant needs to correct this.

Both businesses are located in Pie Town, a neighborhood on the southern edge of downtown Nashville. There's not a whole lot of stuff in this part of town. These are definitely two of the highlights.\n\nTennessee Brew Works opened on August 18, 2013. It's popular. This place has won numerous awards and earned plenty of recognition including the best brewery in Tennessee according to Yelp. These folks are all about being local, green, and sustainable. The taproom is two stories with views of the brewery from both floors. There's a patio with both covered and uncovered spaces (mostly uncovered) as well as a small, string-lit rooftop patio. As this is a brewery, the property has an industrial, warehouse feel to it, much like the other businesses in Pie Town. It's clean and modernized. The first floor of the brewery features a small stage for live music (a band was setting up on our way out) and the room upstairs, which is much more spacious, has TVs playing sports and nice overhead views of the brewery floor below.\n\nBrewery tours take place every Saturday at 3pm, 4pm, and 5pm. It costs $10 plus tax and a fee per person. Tickets for the tour can be purchased online.\n\nAlong with high-quality craft beer, the brewery also serves food. Their limited menu includes apps/snacks like Baja fish tacos, Springer Mountain chicken wings, salads, burgers, and sandwiches (including a Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich). Food prices range from $8 to $18 per plate.\n\nWe grabbed a few beers and hung out inside the taproom downstairs. Downstairs, they use barrels (some with tabletops) for tables with bar stools. We showed up around 2pm on a Saturday and the place was busy. It wasn't slammed or jam-packed, but most of the tables upstairs and downstairs were taken. Our group of six was lucky to find a table in a corner next to some brewery windows. The atmosphere was very relaxed and laid back. The staff was cool and friendly. We all enjoyed our time here.\n\nI don't think Tennessee Brew Works has dedicated parking. We parked for free on the street (Middleton Street because we also went to Third Man Records).

It's managed by the city's Parks & Rec department. This is a great sightseeing spot in Philly. I recommend it. The views are beautiful.\n\nSome quick Q&A:\n\n1. Why is it called Logan Circle?\n\nBecause it serves as a major traffic circle for Benjamin Franklin Parkway (https://www.yelp.com/biz/ben-franklin-parkway-philadelphia), connecting it to North 19th Street, Vine Street, and Race Street.\n\n2. Why is it called Logan Square?\n\nBecause it was one of five squares originally planned for the city in 1864 by William Penn, founder of Pennsylvania.\n\n3. Who is the circle/square named after?\n\nJames Logan, 14th mayor of Philadelphia.\n\nLogan Circle is actually surrounded by three other parks: Aviator Park, Sister Cities Park, and Shakespeare Park (small). Combined, the land area for these four parks, including the roads (Benjamin Franklin Parkway is wide and scenic) is about four city blocks. So for a city park, it's not huge, but not small neither.\n\nThe highlight of Logan Circle is a large fountain in the center called the Swann Memorial Fountain: https://www.yelp.com/biz/swann-memorial-fountain-philadelphia-2. We visited on a bright and sunny Sunday afternoon and the park was filled with people, both locals and tourists. Even though there were signs that said no swimming in the fountain, I can't tell you how many kids I saw swimming and playing in the fountain. A lot. It almost looked more like a pool or water park than a historic fountain.\n\nLogan Circle is centrally-located between Philadelphia City Hall and the Philadelphia Museum of Art (Rocky Steps: https://www.yelp.com/biz/rocky-steps-philadelphia). Benjamin Franklin Parkway connects all of it. If you've never been to Philly before and want to sight-see, I think walking the parkway between city hall and the museum is a must. Including the aforementioned adjacent parks, Logan Circle is surrounded by sights and attractions including the Franklin Institute, the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University, and the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul.\n\nNote: At the time of writing this review, there's another Yelp listing for Logan Circle. It's called Logan Square Park: https://www.yelp.com/biz/logan-square-park-philadelphia.

I purchased my old Google Pixel phone from the Google Store (online). One of the options I could add to my phone was Device Protection for $99. Device protection is the same thing as phone insurance and Assurant was the provider.\n\nThe coverage I purchased was good for two years from the date I received my phone. The maximum number of accidental damage repairs or replacements under Device Protection was two during the coverage period. My Pixel's camera lenses, both front and back, got scratched. The scratches caused light streaks in my photos and videos so I decided to file a claim and get a replacement.\n\nPer the Device Protection welcome and terms and conditions email I got from Assurant, I filed my claim at https://mydeviceprotect.com/. It was really quick and easy to do, especially since Assurant had most of my information on file from my phone's IMEI/serial number. I filed my claim on a Friday night. In less than 24 hours, someone from Assurant called to verify my information and approve my claim. I received a claim approval email after the call and a shipping notification that Monday (first business day after my claim was approved). I received my replacement Pixel on Tuesday afternoon; basically, in two business days. Fast!\n\nI did have to pay a $79 deductible, but it was totally worth it to me. It was like I got a brand new Pixel for only $178 ($99 for Device Protection + $79 deductible). Technically, the phone was refurbished, but it looked and worked like new - the battery too, which was huge, since my old battery was on its way out. Considering my particular phone model at the time, a 32-GB Pixel 1, originally retailed for $649, I thought this was a good deal. Plus, I had one more replacement remaining on my contract before my two years were up. It was nice to have that peace of mind.\n\nGoogle made it easy to transfer all of my apps and data from my old Pixel to my new Pixel. I just connected the two phones with a USB-C cable and followed the prompts. The entire transfer took about an hour (my new Pixel had to download and install almost 100 apps). I was really pleased with how simple and seamless the transition was. My old phone was essentially mirrored to my new one which was exactly what I wanted. I did have to set up new fingerprint recognition and log in to all of my apps again, but that was it. I was back up and running with a \"new\" phone with hardly any interruption.\n\nI returned my old Pixel in the same packaging that my new Pixel came in. Assurant emailed me a shipping label to print and tape to the outside of the box. I had to return my old Pixel within 14 days from the date my new Pixel was shipped. Otherwise, I could've been charged an \"unrecovered equipment fee\" of up to $2,000.\n\nIn the end, I am very happy with the Device Protection I purchased from Assurant. I already bought it again for my latest phone, the Pixel 3, for $129 (unsurprisingly, the insurance price went up).", "date": "2019-02-03 16:24:22"}, {"_key": "2258282", "_id": "reviews/2258282", "_rev": "_fNyzHbW---", "review_id": "xNTO7hUoAIx9I2uL0s8K-g", "user_id": "j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "business_id": "pCmaISSyKum22MOtPOxL-w", "stars": 3, "useful": 10, "funny": 3, "cool": 8, "text": "The Philadelphia Phillies are one of the oldest American professional sports franchises, established in 1883. Unlike other storied teams, the Fightin' Phils have never left their original city.\n\nIt took nearly 100 years, but the Phillies were able to win their first World Series championship in 1980 and then again, 28 years later, in 2008. In 1980, future Hall-of-Famer and perhaps the greatest third baseman of all time, Mike Schmidt, led Philadelphia to a 4-2 series win over the Kansas City Royals. In 2008, four-time All-Star pitcher Cole Hamels led Philly in a dominating series performance over the Tampa Bay Rays, 4-1. (Since 2020, Hamels has played for my favorite team, the Atlanta Braves.)\n\nThe Phillies play at Citizens Bank Park, located in South Philly. The ballpark opened in 2004 and is part of the South Philadelphia Sports Complex which includes the adjacent Lincoln Financial Field (home of the NFL's Philadelphia Eagles) and Wells Fargo Center (home of the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers). You can see the complex from the interstate (I-95) as you drive into the city from the airport. It's just across the Delaware River from New Jersey.\n\nThe Phillies haven't done well since 2011, the last year they made the playoffs. From 2012 to present, they've yet to finish a single season above .500 (they finished at exactly .500 twice, in 2012 and 2019), a far cry from their 2008 championship. However, the Charlie Manuel (manager) years (2005-2013), immediately preceding the current playoff drought, comprise a great era in Philadelphia's baseball history. Under Manuel, the Phillies made the playoffs five straight seasons (including that '08 World Series title), had first baseman Ryan Howard named NL Rookie of the Year in 2005 and then NL MVP the following year in 2006, shortstop Jimmy Rollins named NL MVP in 2007, and pitcher Roy Halladay named NL Cy Young Award winner in 2010. Unfortunately, the team hasn't been the same since Manuel's firing during the 2013 season.\n\nAt the time of writing this review, the Phillies have an all-time win percentage of .472 (9,853 wins against 11,032 losses).", "date": "2021-02-12 20:10:07"}, {"_key": "2310438", "_id": "reviews/2310438", "_rev": "_fNyzWcO--X", "review_id": "Ez_VZ6uSsna2r9tGKbWbKA", "user_id": "j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "business_id": "TgbI5_wXWa82NBVwkvC0yQ", "stars": 4, "useful": 5, "funny": 1, "cool": 3, "text": "We stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott Philadelphia Plymouth Meeting and really enjoyed our stay. Everyone at the hotel seemed nice, especially Kim, the lady who checked us in. Kim set the tone and was really welcoming and affable. The hotel and amenities were nice considering the tier of hotel and price paid. We were part of a wedding block and were charged $119.90 per night after taxes. Not bad.\n\nIf you're not familiar with Philadelphia, this hotel is located in the suburbs northwest of town. There's plenty of free parking and the hotel is located within walking distance of a big shopping mall, Plymouth Meeting Mall, that is anchored in part by a Whole Foods. Aside from the mall, if you don't have a car, you're going to have to Lyft/Uber to get anywhere.\n\nThis Courtyard by Marriott is four stories. Our room was 335 on the 3rd floor. It was a \"KSOF\" (king with sofa bed) room with a view of the parking lot and office building to the north. The hotel is surrounded by several office buildings so I suspect a lot of business travelers stay here to work at those buildings.\n\nFrom the outside, the hotel looks like your standard Courtyard by Marriott. Inside, it looks like some renovation work has been done. The place was clean and looked fairly modern. While there's no full-service restaurant or shop, there is a fast-casual counter where you can order made-to-order food and drinks, a small retail corner with grab-and-go items, some dining and lounge-like areas, and a business center of sorts. There's also an indoor pool, hot tub, and gym. The gym is tiny. Outside in the back is a little courtyard with nice landscaping and additional seating. It's worth exploring and checking out.\n\nWhen we checked in, Kim handed us two bottles of water and two Peanut Chews, delicious candy bars that are manufactured in Pennsylvania.\n\nOur room was clean and comfy, and contemporary in design. The toiletries, such as the shampoo, conditioner, and body wash, were Paul Mitchell Tea Tree brand. The bathroom had a standard tub and shower with a floor that was tastefully tiled. The bed was very comfortable, from the soft-yet-firm mattress to the silky-smooth and smell-good sheets. There was an artsy-looking couch (sofa bed) with a conveniently-angled end table. The office desk was extendable which was great for more surface space. The TV was a smart TV with apps like Netflix and YouTube installed. There was a coffee maker, iron and ironing board, luggage rack, and hair dryer. The Wi-Fi was free and fast enough. And there was free, self-serve, tasty coffee and fruit-flavored ice water in the lobby.\n\nStandard check-in time is 3pm and check-out is 12pm. I used the Marriott Bonvoy app to keep track of my reservation and make an early check-in (12pm) request. The hotel (Kim) was quick to respond to my chat messages in the app and she remembered me from our chat conversation when I showed up in person to check-in. I like how they stay on top of that. Saturday night, when the lobby was used for the wedding after-party, I called in a request for additional toiletries and housekeeping was reasonably quick to respond despite the craziness going on downstairs. I appreciated that.\n\nOverall, I think this is a very good mid-tier hotel.

The Flyers won back-to-back Stanley Cups in 1974 and 1975. The team's number of championships (2) is tied for 11th best in the league. Historically, the Flyers have been a perennial playoff team. All time, the team ranks in the top 10 in total playoff seasons. However, over the last decade, the Flyers have only made the playoffs on average about every other year. All things considered, Philadelphia has been home to one of the NHL's better-performing franchises.\n\nThe Flyers are among the NHL's second-oldest members. They were part of the second wave of franchises that joined during the league's 1967 expansion. That expansion saw the league size double from six teams (the Original Six) to 12 teams. Of the 1967 expansion teams, Philadelphia was the first to win the Stanley Cup. Another 1967 expansion team, the in-state rival Pittsburgh Penguins, have won the Stanley Cup five times (the most of any of the expansion teams from that year). After winning back-to-back titles in 1974 and 1975, the Flyers went on to appear in six more Stanley Cup Finals, the latest in 2010.\n\nFour of the Flyers' six retired jersey numbers belong to players who won the Stanley Cup. They include goaltender Bernie Parent, defenseman Barry Ashbee, left-winger Bill Barber, and center Bobby Clarke. Parent is a legend among goalies and a Philadelphia sports icon. Clarke was the captain of both teams that won the Stanley Cup. Parent, Barber, and Clarke were all inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. Ashbee was a member of the 1974 championship team, but his career was unfortunately cut short from an eye injury he suffered in the Flyers' series preceding the Stanley Cup Finals. Tragically, only about three years later, Ashbee passed away from leukemia at age 37.\n\nThe Flyers' home arena is the Wells Fargo Center. With a present seating capacity of 19,600 (the number can vary depending on where you look; 19,600 is from the Wells Fargo Center website), the Wells Fargo Center is the fourth-biggest arena in the NHL. The Flyers and the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers have been the building's only two full-time occupants since the building opened in 1996. The seating capacity for Sixers games is slightly larger at 21,000.

Sadly, Edmonton has only made the playoffs twice since losing to the Carolina Hurricanes in a heartbreaking Game 7 in the 2006 Stanley Cup Finals. However, their history in the 80s cannot be denied. The Oilers won the Cup five times in seven years: 1984, 1985, 1987, 1988, and 1990. To date, the Oilers are tied with the Pittsburgh Penguins for the sixth-most number of Stanley Cup championships. The Oilers and the Penguins have the most NHL titles outside of the Original Six. A finer point, the Oilers franchise did not join the NHL until 1979 while the Penguins were part of the league's 1967 expansion. It's impressive how many championships Edmonton racked up after being a member of the NHL for only about a decade.\n\n\"The Great One\" Wayne Gretzky, started his NHL career with Edmonton. He is the franchise's all-time scoring leader in both goals (583) and points (1,669). Unlike many of the great hockey players today, Gretzky was not drafted. He played in the now-defunct World Hockey Association (WHA) for Edmonton for one season before the WHA folded. After that, the Oilers joined the NHL and the rest is history. Gretzky won all four of his Stanley Cups with Edmonton. He left the team in 1988 when he was traded by the Oilers to the Los Angeles Kings. The Oilers would go on to win the following Stanley Cup without him and Gretzky would never win another Cup again.\n\nToday, Connor McDavid is the Oilers' best player. He's currently considered one of the best players in hockey. Edmonton drafted him with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft. Already, McDavid has won the Hart Memorial Trophy (NHL regular season MVP in 2017; Gretzky won the Hart Trophy nine times), the Ted Lindsay Award twice (NHL regular season most outstanding player in 2017 and 2018), and the Art Ross Trophy twice (NHL regular season most points in 2017 and 2018). He was also on the cover of EA Sports NHL 18. He's quickly climbing up in the franchise record books.\n\nThe Oilers' current home is Rogers Place, located in downtown Edmonton. Opened in 2016, Rogers Place is one of the NHL's newest arenas. It has over 1,250 TV screens and the largest HD center ice scoreboard in the league. For hockey, Rogers Place has a seating capacity of 18,347. The Edmonton Oil Kings of the Western Hockey League (WHL) have also called Rogers Place home since 2016.

It's located just one block away from Philadelphia City Hall and is adjacent to the very popular Reading Terminal Market, so it's convenient to other must-see spots in the city.\n\nBy my count, Chinatown takes up about 21 city blocks. The Pennsylvania Convention Center takes up roughly a quarter of the neighborhood. Like other Chinatowns in big American cities, Philly's Chinatown is relatively old and densely-packed. Food is a big draw, of course, with restaurants serving not only Chinese food like dim sum and Peking duck, but also Japanese ramen and yakitori, Korean fried chicken, Malaysian, Thai, and Vietnamese cuisine, and vegetarian food. There are also Asian bakeries and bubble tea galore.\n\nThe official entrance to Chinatown is located on the south side of the neighborhood on N 10th St at Arch St. The gate is known as the Friendship Gate or Friendship Arch (https://www.yelp.com/biz/chinatown-friendship-gate-philadelphia). It's a vehicular gate and, ironically, traffic flows only one-way: out of Chinatown. N 10th St is also home to the Chinese Cultural & Community Center as well as the Mandarin-language campus of the Chinese Christian Church & Center (https://www.yelp.com/biz/chinese-christian-church-and-center-philadelphia-2).\n\nI attended a wedding at the church's Vine Campus which is less than a five-minute walk away. Vine St forms Chinatown's north border with N Broad St to the west, N 7th St to the east, and Arch St to the south. The neighborhood immediately north of Chinatown, Callowhill, is referred to by many as Chinatown North. The Asian Arts Initiative, a non-profit community and arts center, is located there (https://www.yelp.com/biz/asian-arts-initiative-philadelphia).\n\nIf you want to sight-see and explore Chinatown, N 10th St at Race St is a good place to start. From there, there's a lot of stuff to see in every direction.\n\nIn addition to being close to City Hall and Reading Terminal Market, Chinatown is also only a block away from the National Constitution Center, Independence National Historical Park, and other historic spots on the east side of town.", "date": "2019-10-20 15:43:11"}, {"_key": "2499964", "_id": "reviews/2499964", "_rev": "_fNyzcR---b", "review_id": "S0K28CD-74j6CZzlq7PQmg", "user_id": "j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "business_id": "0k8DG6BPaVKCRfnWJZhLUA", "stars": 4, "useful": 7, "funny": 5, "cool": 6, "text": "I've reviewed a lot of things on Yelp, from bridges and tunnels (http://bit.ly/2YCOtxX) to gas stations (http://bit.ly/2GXPRAi), but never a gate. This is my first review of a gate.\n\nThe Chinatown Friendship Gate, also known as the Chinatown Friendship Arch and the China Gate, is the \"official\" entrance to Philadelphia's Chinatown. The gate is located on N 10th St at Arch St. It's 40 feet tall and weighs 88 tons. It's called the Friendship Gate because it symbolizes the friendship between Philly and its sister city in China, Tianjin. The gate officially \"opened\" (was dedicated) in January 1984 with a rededication in 2008.\n\nThis is a neat landmark and worth checking out if you've never been to Philly Chinatown before. It's ornate and colorful and makes for a nice photo/selfie. The architectural style comes from the Ming (1368 to 1644) and Qing (1644 to 1912) dynasties. I think Philly's Chinatown gate trumps San Francisco's Chinatown gate, Dragon Gate (http://bit.ly/2Yy21uu), in terms of size and decor, but SF's gate is actually three gates in one (two gates for pedestrians and one for vehicles). This gate is built over vehicular traffic only: two one-way car lanes and one one-way bike lane, all heading south out of Chinatown and into Center City.\n\nIf you're visiting Philly from out of town, I recommend going to Tea Do (http://bit.ly/2M9XSWV) one block north of the gate and Reading Terminal Market (http://bit.ly/2OOoUFG) two blocks east.\n\nAfter leaving a review for this gate, I realized I never left one for the SF version (http://bit.ly/2Yy21uu).

I ordered a dozen of these, but only received 10.  After letting the server know, he (eventually) brought out three additional oysters.\n\nThe charbroiled oysters were hot off the grill, very buttery, and quite tasty.  However, many of the oysters were quite small (the key to good charbroiled oysters is to use big fat oysters).  At $16.95 for one dozen, it may not have been worth it.\n\nWe also tried to order raw oysters of which they had none.  Our server tried to explain to us why they did not have raw oysters and all we could surmise from his explanation was that there were not a sufficient number of oyster boats due to the BP oil spill, but he also mentioned something about a one-hour refrigeration time, so it left us a bit confused.  Oh well.  No raw oysters = bad.\n\nDrago's serves higher-end Creole cuisine and also specializes in a variety of lobster dishes.  The restaurant is located at the ground level of the Hilton.

I love spicy food and who doesn't love fried chicken? The combination is truly mouthwatering and delicious. I'm getting hungry just writing this review.\n\nSince 2012, Hattie B's has grown into a small chain specializing in Nashville hot chicken. This location, in the Melrose neighborhood of Nashville, is the company's third and newest location in the city. It's relatively new, having opened less than a year ago (November 2017). A location recently opened in July 2018 where I live in Atlanta. At the time of writing this review, the chain's newest location opened last month in August 2018 inside The Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas.\n\nWhile Hattie B's isn't the originator of Nashville hot chicken (Prince's Hot Chicken Shack was the first and many say they do it better), Hattie B's has done a lot to popularize it in the last six-plus years.\n\nWe visited this location on a Friday shortly after the business opened at 11am. This was my first visit to a Hattie B's and I heard the restaurants often have long lines/waits. Since we arrived early, we barely had to wait. This is a fast-casual joint where you place your order and pay upfront at the counter and then wait for your food to be served to you. Fountain drinks, tea, and lemonade are self-serve.\n\nThe ample seating at this location - it's got a spacious dining room and covered patio - was the main reason we chose to come to this location over the other two in Nashville. It turned out to be the right choice. The place was mostly empty when we arrived, but was packed with a line out the door and spilling onto the sidewalk when we left shortly after 12pm. So, if you want to avoid a wait, arrive early.\n\nThe restaurant itself looks great. It looks like new construction. A functional, modern design with a somewhat vintage Southern feel. There's a fenced-in lawn outside, next to the patio, with umbrella-covered picnic tables and cornhole. TVs inside and out. It was nice and clean during our visit.\n\nHattie B's serves hot chicken plates that come with different types of chicken, two Southern sides, bread, and pickles for anywhere from $8.50 for a small dark plate (leg/thigh quarter) to $13.50 for a large white plate (two breast/wing quarters). They also serve wings, tenders, and chicken sandwiches ($9 per sammie). With the hot chicken, you can go with zero heat or choose from five heat levels, ranging in spicy intensity from \"Mild\" (\"touch of heat\") to \"Shut the Cluck Up!!!\" (\"burn notice\").\n\nDesserts include classics like banana pudding, peach cobbler, and floats ($3 each). Aside from the aforementioned non-alcoholic drinks, they serve beer (draft, canned, and bottled) too. Finally, on Sundays from 11am to 4pm, you can get chicken and waffles ($11-16 each) and bacon cheese grits.\n\nWe ordered a bunch of stuff. Here are the things I tried:\n\n* Small dark plate (leg/thigh quarter at medium heat) with pimento mac & cheese and Southern greens ($8.50)\n* Tenders plate ($9.50) - three jumbo tenders (two at medium heat, one at hot) with crinkle-cut fries and creamy coleslaw\n* Large white plate (two breasts/wing quarters) with baked beans and Southern greens ($13.50)\n* One additional tender ($2) at \"Shut the Cluck Up!!!\" spicy\n* Peach cobbler ($3)\n\nThe chicken and sides were yummy. Every piece of chicken, whether it was dark meat, white meat, or a tender was packed with flavor and spice. In terms of enjoyment level, I liked the medium and hot spice levels the best. In terms of taste, I thought the dark meat, naturally, tasted the best. The leg and thigh were tender, juicy, and extra savory. The batter on the dark meat chicken was most crispy and crunchy. Just excellent.\n\nThe tenders were my second-favorite followed by the white meat chicken (breast and wing). All chicken types came with a good portion of meat, particularly the white meat. Despite being white meat, the breast and wing still had a good bit of crunch on the outside and moistness and tenderness on the inside. It was good stuff.\n\nOne bite of the \"Shut the Cluck Up!!!\" tender and my mouth was definitely on fire, but not a sensation I haven't felt before (being a lover of spicy food). However, there comes a point where food gets so spicy that you can no longer taste the food and only feel the heat. At that point, it's not enjoyable anymore. That's what Hattie B's \"Shut the Cluck Up!!!\" is. It's legitimately very spicy, but I don't recommend it to most people unless one just wants to try it for the experience.\n\nEach order of chicken, even the lone tender, were customarily served atop a slice of white bread with two pickles toothpicked on top of the meat.\n\nAs for the sides and dessert, they were OK to great. My favorites (great) were the Southern greens (with pepper sauce), baked beans, and peach cobbler. The pimento mac & cheese was good while the creamy coleslaw was just alright (I don't really recommend the latter).

Completed in 1901, it's the largest city hall in America, covering 14.5 acres of total floor space and rising high at 548 feet (it was the tallest building in Philadelphia until 1986). The building is topped with an enormous statue of William Penn, founder of Philadelphia and Pennsylvania. This statue is its most notable and defining feature. It's situated so high, you can see it from many different places within the city.\n\nCity Hall has made appearances in numerous films including, most recently, the DC superhero movie Shazam! (2019). Something funny happens to William Penn in the movie. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0448115/\n\nThere was also a curse associated with the William Penn statue known as the Curse of Billy Penn. I first learned about it while watching the Rocky location tour documentary Rocky Jumped a Park Bench: https://youtu.be/ryGnmGKbRFo?t=757. In the documentary, host James Rolfe (more famously known as the Angry Video Game Nerd) explains that Philadelphia sports teams were cursed because there was another building in the city that was built higher than William Penn. That curse was broken when the Phillies won the 2008 World Series. Less than 10 years later, the Eagles would go on to win Super Bowl LII (2018). In college sports, Villanova won the 2016 and 2018 NCAA men's basketball championships.\n\nTwo tours are available for City Hall, the Interior Tour and the Tower Tour. The Interior Tour lasts about 1.5 to 2 hours and includes the Tower Tour. The Tower Tour, where you go to the top of the tower for amazing city views, is also available separately. Currently, an adult ticket costs $15 for the Interior Tour and $8 for the Tower Tour (less for military, seniors, and students). Visit the City Hall Visitor Center at 1 S Penn Square, Room 121 and the Independence Visitor Center's website for more info: https://www.phlvisitorcenter.com/CityHall.\n\nNo trip to City Hall is complete without visiting the two relatively new/renovated parks nearby, Dilworth Park (https://www.yelp.com/biz/dilworth-park-philadelphia-9) and Love Park (https://www.yelp.com/biz/love-park-philadelphia).

They're relatively new, having opened in 2017.\n\nAt the time of writing this review, monthly rents start at $1,714 for a 529-square-foot 1 bed/1 bath. 2/2s range from $2,460 for 1,146 square feet to $3,894 for 1,782 square feet with two balconies. Not cheap, but these are \"luxury\" apartments in a prime location with numerous amenities. Amenities include a private clubhouse, billiards/pool table, theater, conference and dining room, gym, courtyards with grills and outdoor fireplaces, bocce, and more. No concierge or swimming pool, however. The apartments have upscale, modern designs with vaulted ceilings. The apartment entrances are interior hallway entrances only.\n\nOne thing that's unique and quirky about Hanover North Broad is the apartment complex is separated into two completely separate buildings. N Broad St, which is a major 6-lane street, splits the two buildings. Our friends live in the East Building, so if they want to go to the gym, they have to cross over a busy street.\n\nWe spent most of our time hanging out and lounging around at the East Building's elevated courtyard. This courtyard was clean with manicured landscaping, bocce, cushioned seating, tables, grills, and cabanas with nice TVs. We couldn't get the fireplace working. I'm not sure what was wrong with it. I was hoping the courtyard would have a nice city view or a view of the street below, but it does not. I'm not sure why they designed it that way; probably because there's not much to look at on Carlton St.\n\nBoth buildings have parking garages that are open to the public for a fee (the ground level of the two buildings includes retail). The East Building garage was brightly lit and felt clean and safe enough.

This local restaurant chain was recommended to us by three separate friends as one of Philadelphia's best spots for breakfast and brunch (they serve lunch and dinner too). The food was good and service was great. While I don't think this place is *significantly* better than other popular and highly-regarded brunch restaurants I've tried, it's still definitely worth checking out if you want American breakfast/brunch comfort food. The food is delicious, though heavy, and the portions are huge and filling.\n\nThere are five Sabrina's locations in the Delaware Valley including three in Philly proper. This location is the second and it opened in 2007 (the first opened in 2001). Sabrina's is named after the owners' daughter. This particular location has \"and Spencer's Too\" in the name because of the owners' son, who was born later. We chose to dine at this location because it was close to our hotel, the Philadelphia 201, which is only a couple blocks away; a short walk. If you're staying at this hotel or anywhere nearby, I do recommend Sabrina's for breakfast/brunch.\n\nI heard this place gets packed with waits the norm. We showed up bright and early on a Monday morning just before opening (8am). A small crowd had already built up on the sidewalk in front of the entrance. When the doors opened, all of us were seated immediately. This place has plenty of space. It has a diner feel to it. You can sit at the counter with its cushioned and pattern-upholstered chairs or at one of the numerous small tables or booths. The atmosphere is casual and homey. There's a tiled coffee bar and lampshades with floral designs.\n\nDuring our visit, the large blackboard menu on the dining room's center wall featured chalk drawings of Sonic and Knuckles (random). Specials included chicken and waffles ($14.95) and dinner entrees like seafood scampi ($15.95) and goat cheese penne pasta ($14.95). We also received a seasonal drink menu and monthly food specials.\n\nSabrina's signature breakfast items are the huevos rancheros ($11.79), stuffed challah French toast ($11.99), and \"The Tots\" ($12.59). Other breakfast/brunch foods include eggs, frittatas, omelettes, pancakes, bagels and lox, housemade granola, avocado toast, and a quinoa bowl. Most of these other items cost about the same or less than the signature items. Most non-breakfast/brunch food includes soups and salads and burgers and sandwiches. Expect to spend about $11-13 each for those items. They have a kids menu too. Beverage-wise, they offer coffee and espresso-based drinks, teas, fresh juices, and Jones brand \"craft\" soda.\n\nWe ordered two signature items and a couple seasonal drinks:\n\n* Stuffed Challah French Toast ($11.99) with farmer's cream cheese topped with bananas and vanilla bean syrup\n* The Tots ($12.59) - fried panko-encrusted tater tots topped with grilled hot sausage hash; caramelized onions, bell peppers, and fennel seed; topped with basil chimichurri, sour cream, and over-easy eggs\n* Cookie Butter Iced Mocha ($4.79) - cookie butter, dark chocolate, espresso, and milk\n* Iced Strawberry Mocha ($4.79) - strawberry, dark chocolate, espresso, and milk\n\nThe food was great. I preferred the Stuffed Challah French Toast over The Tots, but I could change my mind given the day. The French toast was outstanding. The best thing about it to me was the filling: farmer's cream cheese. I'm a cream cheese fan in general, but this particular cream cheese was lighter and less dense than your typical American cream cheese. Its silky smooth texture trended towards whipped cream. Overall, wonderful flavor when combined with the vanilla bean syrup (I love vanilla). Ripe slices of banana and a bit of cinnamon and powdered sugar were thrown on top. The consistency of the French toast itself was soft, springy, and appetizing. I recommend this dish.\n\nThe Tots was heavy, but satisfying. It's a lot of food packed into a medium-sized bowl. The panko-encrusted tater tots were bigger than average tots. They were like tots on steroids. The ingredients, particularly the hot sausage hash and the over-easy eggs, came out temperature hot from the kitchen. I had to wait for the bowl to cool down a bit. This one was a savory, greasy smorgasbord of textures and flavors. I had the tots with ketchup and ate the rest of the dish with various hot sauces at the table (Cholula, Frank's RedHot, Sriracha). If you have a ravenous appetite, The Tots is for you; it's packed with lots of carbs and protein.\n\nThe iced mochas were good. They were expectedly sweet; almost too sweet for me (and I have a sweet tooth). I liked the Cookie Butter Iced Mocha better than the Strawberry. Both drinks were rich, flavorful, and refreshing. The dark chocolate flavor was strong. If you order these, you might ask if you can adjust the sweetness.\n\nPatricia was our server and she was attentive and sweet.

The line to get in wasn't very long, but it was very crowded inside, especially on the first floor. There were two bands, one on the first floor (ground level) as soon as you walk in and one inside on the rooftop (fourth level). I believe both bands were cover bands (definitely the band on the top floor; I remember one song they sang was the Alien Ant Farm version of Smooth Criminal). Both bands were pretty good and most people seemed to be having a good time.\n\nThere are a lot of lights and neon signs on Broadway. You can't miss Paradise Park's sign because it's one of the biggest. It's green and red and spans over two stories. It's one of the most prominent signs on the street. The space has colorful and kitschy decor (neon signs, string lights, Christmas lights, a disco ball, and more). Just inside the entrance is a photo booth and Skee-Ball. During our visit, the second and third floors were closed. The second floor was home to a dueling piano bar called The Big Bang.\n\nWe spent most of our time on the rooftop patio which was a lot more laid back and relaxed than downstairs. The rooftop has both an interior and exterior bar. The outdoor portion of the rooftop is covered in artificial turf with picnic tables, lawn/porch chairs, and high tops for seating. There was always a game of cornhole going on while we were up there. The highlight, to me, is the view from the rooftop.

I thought it was alright.\n\nVirago is part of the \"upscale\" M Street restaurant group which includes five restaurants along McGavock between 12th and 11th Aves. They are: Kayne Prime (steakhouse), Moto (Italian), Saint Anejo (Mexican), Virago, and Whiskey Kitchen (pub grub). We showed up to McGavock around 9:20pm on a Friday night without a reservation to any of these places. After first checking with Whiskey Kitchen and then Saint Anejo, we settled on Virago because they could seat us almost immediately. Whiskey Kitchen and Saint Anejo were packed with waits. There were plenty of open tables at Virago.\n\nVirago is on OpenTable. Book your reservation for free and earn dining points that can be used towards future discounts at select OpenTable restaurants or an Amazon gift card.\n\nAll three of Whiskey Kitchen, Saint Anejo, and Virago looked modern and stylish. It's evident this company has put a lot of money into the construction and design of its restaurants. Virago is the oldest of the bunch. It opened in 2000. It's been in its current spot since 2010 (the original location was in Midtown). This isn't an authentic Japanese or sushi restaurant, but more of a sleek Americanized sushi and Asian fusion joint with a huge drink menu. I'm not a huge fan of these types of places as the food can often be subpar and overpriced. Virago pretty much fell in line.\n\nThe restaurant has a swanky aesthetic. When we visited, it felt a lot like a lounge complete with lounge music and dim lighting. The place is spacious. There's a sizable wraparound sushi bar and multiple dining rooms and seating areas including a large lounge/waiting area with couches. There are private booths, big tables for groups, and a variety of lighting from pendant lights to recessed lighting. This restaurant can easily accommodate groups (we had six in ours) and the candle-lit ambiance is ideal for dates too.\n\nThe dinner menu had a decent selection of Japanese and fusiony food. They included salads and appetizers ($7-14 each) like \"V2 edamame\" (charred edamame with togarashi Japanese spice mix and sweet soy sauce) and yellowtail jalapeno (a popular app); ishiyaki - foods cooked over hot stones ($29-96 per order); agemono - deep-fried dishes ($9-19 each); robatayaki - skewers ($9-24 per order) and meat/seafood ($22-34 each) cooked over charcoal; nigiri and sashimi ($6-15 for two pieces); and makimono - rolls ($13-29 each). They also had chirashi - assorted sashimi over sushi rice ($24 for a small size, $42 for a large), omakase - a chef's tasting ($85 for the \"chef's tour\" and $95 for the \"sushi tour\"), and more. Finally, there were daily specials such as ramen ($17), Waygu strip steak ($30), and matcha sponge cake ($12).\n\nThe drink menu was extensive: cocktails, wine by the bottle or by the glass, over 40 selections of sake (impressive), and all sorts of beer and spirits (scotch, bourbon, Japanese whisky, gin, tequila, vodka, rum, etc.).\n\nHere's what I tried:\n\n* Ishiyaki Wagyu strip, 6 oz. ($35) - hot rock, togarashi salt\n* Chirashi don, large size ($42) - chef's sashimi selection on rice\n* Sake #702. Ozeki Nigori, 375 mL ($17) - crisp and vibrant, unfiltered\n\nIn general, the food was good, though not great, and everything was presented nicely.\n\nThe ishiyaki Wagyu strip was quite tasty though 6 ounces of meat wasn't much. However, what little meat there was was high quality. The meat, which had great marbling, was served raw and cut into thin slices. This was a cook-it-yourself dish. Each slice of meat was cooked, sizzling, on top of a single hot black stone. This dish was 100% meat aside from a miniscule amount of green onion (primarily used as a garnish), oil (I believe it was sesame oil, to help with cooking), two sauces (one a savory dipping sauce and the other a concentrated chili sauce, perhaps Sriracha), and togarashi salt which was more salt than togarashi. Togarashi (or shichimi) contains seven different ingredients including various pepper flakes and sesame seeds. The stone lost its heat towards the end of the meal, so the server had to bring another one. While this dish was yummy, it wasn't filling.\n\nSince I'm allergic to shrimp, I asked for the chirashi don to be prepared without shrimp. There was no shrimp on the plate, but my mouth still experienced a mild allergic reaction. There was definitely some cross-contamination going on. Aside from that, I thought the chirashi was average at best. I order chirashi often at sushi restaurants and Virago's version was simply OK. The large version was filling (at $42, it should be). It contained plenty of thick slices of ahi tuna, yellowtail, salmon, escolar, and albacore tuna plus avocado, cucumber, and multicolored fish eggs (either tobiko or masago).\n\nWe got multiple bottles of the Ozeki Nigori, a cloudy, milky-white sake.

The original sculpture is inside the Indianapolis Museum of Art.\n\nUnlike other cities, Philly's Love sculpture is propped up high so you can stand and pose for a shot underneath it (as opposed to in front or beside it). The park serves as the southern endpoint for Benjamin Franklin Parkway (https://www.yelp.com/biz/ben-franklin-parkway-philadelphia), a wide one-mile-long street worth walking if you've never been to Philly before. If you look north (technically, northwest) up the parkway, you can see Logan Square (https://www.yelp.com/biz/logan-circle-philadelphia-2) and the Philadelphia Museum of Art (https://www.yelp.com/biz/philadelphia-museum-of-art-philadelphia) with its famous Rocky Steps (https://www.yelp.com/biz/rocky-steps-philadelphia). It's a cool visual.\n\nThe park must have been renovated relatively recently because pictures I've seen of it on Yelp show a fountain which no longer exists. Instead, there's now a big splash pad. Dilworth Park (https://www.yelp.com/biz/dilworth-park-philadelphia-9), one block over, has one too. Kids were having a blast in both. Around Love Park's splash pad are several red lounge chairs. A nearby gravel space has umbrella-covered red tables with additional seating including tree-shaded benches. There's a lot of green space, but perhaps almost equally, a lot of concrete, gravel, and brick. The trees and benches in the brickyard on the southeast end of the square are nice touches. A modern-looking glass building on the northeast side serves as an entrance/exit to an underground parking garage.\n\nThis park is also known as John F Kennedy Plaza.\n\nFun fact: Love Park was designed by Philadelphia city planner Edmund Bacon, father of Kevin Bacon.", "date": "2019-09-21 07:49:27"}, {"_key": "3666592", "_id": "reviews/3666592", "_rev": "_fNy0ZxG--K", "review_id": "-RRIbHW7McNb9vgXiquVYg", "user_id": "j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "business_id": "ZsnasqY3YhRf_g2OmlTtoA", "stars": 3, "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "text": "This review is for our recent Delta Air Lines flights (two round trips) into and out of Philadelphia International Airport (PHL). In short, these trips were fine.\n\nI checked prices using kayak.com and booked using delta.com. I flew with my fiancee. For all flights, our seats were assigned at the gate. In all cases, Delta automatically seated us next to each other. We flew coach so we always got one middle seat and one window or aisle seat. On one or two flights, we got the exit row, which was nice. I remember at least one of our flights was on a McDonnell Douglas MD-90.\n\nFor one of the flights, we boarded and sat at the gate in Atlanta for about an hour. This didn't bother me since we weren't in a rush. I just watched Pet Sematary (2019) on my laptop.\n\nWe flew out of and into Atlanta. Our first round trip, arriving on a Friday and departing on a Monday, booked about three months out, cost $303.60 per person. Our second round trip, arriving on a Saturday and departing the following Sunday (quick turnaround), booked about two months out, cost $360.60 per person. Same season. Delta-estimated flight times were anywhere from 1 hour 55 minutes to 2 hours 9 minutes. In actuality, I think one or more of the flights was slightly under 1 hour 50 minutes (in pure flight time).\n\nOn a flight into Atlanta, we were one of the last ones to board, so we had to check our roller bags at the gate (free). Unlike some gate checks where you can pick up your bag at the gate at the destination (usually, on smaller jets), this particular check meant we had to pick up our bags at baggage claim in Atlanta. The Delta app was useful in helping us keep track of our checked bags, letting us know the bag tag numbers and which baggage claim carousel in Atlanta to go to. The app also notified us when our bags were available for pick-up.\n\nThe Delta app gives you a bit of information about your flight including statistics such as the percentage of time your flight is on time. One of our flights had a historical on-time rate of 97%.\n\nOur in-flight experiences were fine. No complaints. Each flight included a free drink and and a snack. The snack was a choice of a small bag of Cheez-Its, a single pack of those popular Biscoff cookies (my dad likes to buy boxes of them from Costco), a KIND bar, or almonds (I forget the brand, but it was one of those well-known brands). Not all the snacks I listed were available on every flight, but there were at least two choices on every flight.\n\nWe flew into and out of gates D12 and D14. Getting through TSA PreCheck at PHL Terminal D was super fast. https://www.yelp.com/biz/tsa-checkpoint-d-philadelphia-international-airport-philadelphia", "date": "2019-11-30 15:15:34"}, {"_key": "3678242", "_id": "reviews/3678242", "_rev": "_fNy0aGa--e", "review_id": "IamSO9DBQzX_VknoGNNiwg", "user_id": "j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "business_id": "kbEVlzQLcYS3JSQPG9QMOQ", "stars": 4, "useful": 5, "funny": 1, "cool": 4, "text": "How can you not like the Liberty Bell, a symbol of American freedom?\n\nThe Liberty Bell, which was originally cast in 1752, is located inside a building known as the Liberty Bell Center which opened in October 2003. The center is located next to Independence Hall within Independence National Historical Park, a park that consists of several blocks in Center City, Philadelphia.\n\nAdmission is free. The bell is owned by the City of Philadelphia and the center is run by the National Park Service. The center is open daily, except Christmas Day, on a first-come, first-served basis. There's not much to the place. You have to go through security (metal detectors, bag inspection) to enter. Once you enter, there's a hallway with various exhibits about the bell including a 10-minute video put together by the History Channel.\n\nOf course, the main attraction is the Liberty Bell itself which is located in a room at the end of the hallway. The bell is roped off so you can't touch it, but you can walk around it. You can view and take pictures of the bell from 360 degrees. The room the bell is located in is cool because the backdrop is Independence Hall (https://www.yelp.com/biz/independence-hall-philadelphia). Admission to Independence Hall is free too. Whoever designed this center did a great job because the backdrop is perfect; very picturesque. The bell is attended/guarded by a National Park Service ranger.\n\nWe visited the center on an ordinary Sunday around 5:40pm. There was a line to enter the building, but it moved fast. We were through security in about 5 minutes. There was a small crowd around the bell, but luckily, everyone was polite and respectful, keeping their distance and taking pictures in turn. Our entire visit at the center lasted less than 20 minutes. We could have spent more time looking at the hallway exhibits, but were hungry and wanted to get to Jim's Steaks (South Street location, about a 15-minute walk away) for a cheesesteak dinner.\n\nThe center was clean, modern, and felt safe.\n\nWe're glad we came here. This is definitely a spot worth checking out.", "date": "2019-09-08 13:52:58"}, {"_key": "3701667", "_id": "reviews/3701667", "_rev": "_fNy0aya--O", "review_id": "YNfCdviDj90zM3towWSYtA", "user_id": "j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "business_id": "io4YNLvABJrFraEwtQBWqA", "stars": 2, "useful": 10, "funny": 1, "cool": 3, "text": "Where do I even begin with this hotel? How is this a Marriott property? If folks from Marriott corporate saw the condition of this hotel during our stay, they would not be happy. This is easily the worst Marriott property I've stayed at. It certainly didn't live up to the Marriott name/standard. This hotel does have a few things going for it, but the cons definitely outweigh the pros.\n\nFYI, this used to be the Sheraton Philadelphia Downtown.\n\nWe stayed in room 1426 on the 14th floor. This hotel has 26 floors, I believe.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Excellent location. If you want to be close to all of the tourist attractions and hot spots in Philly, this hotel is central to it all.\n\n2. Good value. We paid $119 a night, a wedding block rate, which wasn't too much cheaper than the standard rate. I think this is a good price for a hotel room located downtown in a big city.\n\n3. Friendly staff. From the ladies at the front desk to our housekeeper, Gisella (not sure if I spelled her name right), everyone we interacted with was nice and polite. Even a restaurant server smiled at us as we passed by.\n\n4. Big smart TV. Not the best picture quality or responsiveness, but good enough. It had all the major channels and streaming services. You have to use your own accounts for the streaming services.\n\n5. Fast and free Internet. The Wi-Fi in our room was blazing fast. Great!\n\n6. Good, basic amenities. Luggage rack, iron and ironing board, coffee maker, hair dryer, and toiletries (bar soap, body wash, lotion, shampoo, conditioner). However, they did not offer a couple common amenities; see #4 under Cons below.\n\n7. Cool-looking, modern bathroom. There was a walk-in shower with a hand-held shower head. Both the sink and shower looked relatively new.\n\n8. Elevators were fast.\n\nCons:\n\n1. This hotel was old and it showed. We also happened to stay during the wrong time -- there were signs in the hotel that said, \"Pardon our appearance as we reimagine our guest rooms.\" So we visited before/during a renovation. Everything, it seemed, was on its last legs and the whole place, from the lobby to our room, smelled funny.\n\n2. Our room was in poor condition.\n- All of the furniture was well worn, from the surfaces of the open closet to the edges of the dresser and bathroom shelving.\n- The switch on one of three lamps in our room was broken. In order to turn the lamp on/off, we either had to unscrew the light bulb (which is what I think the previous guest(s) did since the bulb was unscrewed upon arrival) or unplug the lamp from the power outlet. We opted for the latter.\n- The bed old, creaky, and not very comfortable. It was in worse shape than my 14-year-old mattress which I just got rid of recently. Yikes.\n- One of two nightstands was super weak and wobbly. It felt like it was going to fall apart just from a gentle push. I uploaded a video if you want to see.\n- One of two phones was missing buttons.\n- The cabinet door in the bathroom was missing its knob. We couldn't even open it for the duration of our stay.\n- The bathroom faucet looked relatively new and nice, but it wasn't seated/secured properly. It was very loose. Check out my video.\n\n3. Upon check-in, our room was dirty.\n- There was an obvious stain on the carpet in one corner of our room. What could it have been? Coffee? Bodily fluids? I don't think we wanted to know. Check out my photos to see it.\n- The lamps were dusty.\n- The power sockets at our desk were very dusty.\n- The room had a decent view, but it was spoiled by the dirty windows. They were quite dirty from the outside and needed a good wash.\n- The carpet was old, dingy, and frankly, gross. We didn't step on it with our bare feet and instead wore sandals to walk around the room.\n- There were stains on both our bed skirt and comforter.\n- One of two coffee cup lids was dirty on the inside.\n- Perhaps the grossest thing were the tongs for our ice bucket. They had some nasty, brown, sticky stuff on them. It looked like dried-up syrup.\n\n4. Our room did not have the following common amenities (for a Marriott or similar property):\n- Mini fridge\n- Safe\n\n5. Our \"king\" room didn't even have a true king bed. It wasn't even a queen. The bed was smaller than a queen.\n\n6. While the shower was nice, the water pressure was low and the shower head was placed awkwardly in the corner above the retractable seat. This made showering awkward as I'd have to lean over the seat to wash my hair. The shower space wasn't fully utilized. Weird placement.\n\n7. The bathroom didn't have much surface space to put our toiletries, both inside and outside the shower.\n\n8. The AC unit was old and loud. It was one of those wall units with a control panel on the unit itself. There was another thermostat on the opposite wall, but it didn't seem to serve a purpose.\n\n9. There was no ice machine on our floor (14) so I had to go down to 12.\n\n10. Poor security. Anyone could walk into the hotel from any door at any hour it seemed. No key card was required to access the floors either.", "date": "2019-07-10 13:58:37"}, {"_key": "1977876", "_id": "reviews/1977876", "_rev": "_fNyy81a--V", "review_id": "vILRJrV_Qxhroxgn4_cstw", "user_id": "2WnXYQFK0hXEoTxPtV2zvg", "business_id": "N5QQdPac1cXwOHr-ePr90g", "stars": 5, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "text": "I love this place.

We ordered the Surfer's roll...twice...maybe three times because every time it hit the table everyone began using their chopsticks as weapons of war. We went on to devour the Red Dragon and Montecito rolls with impatient precision. The ahi tuna appetizer is also worth noting. The sushi is served in press box form so you won't find any seaweed holding things together or impacting the overall taste. Every dish is positioned like artwork with splashes of colorful sauces striped across and as you eat and dip the image on the plate transforms. \n\nIt's not cheap but it's also completely worth the price tag. Plus, they are cool with BYOB so our feast for four ended at under $40 each. For a bonus, see if you can convince your dining companion that the HD fish screen is actually a live feed of the tank in the back kitchen. The fish is fresh enough for it to be convincing...", "date": "2010-09-28 18:34:01"}, {"_key": "2174909", "_id": "reviews/2174909", "_rev": "_fNyzESy--M", "review_id": "Y5Qgbesj0pjYBTEpJlPK1A", "user_id": "q_QQ5kBBwlCcbL1s4NVK3g", "business_id": "USyJiGIvZ8fHjRVaVTu1Zw", "stars": 3, "useful": 8, "funny": 7, "cool": 9, "text": "Is it sacreligious to say that the Philly cheesesteaks here were less than amazing?

Everything that was put in front of me, I devoured, and happily.  I was amazed at how they chose flavors that I never considered together, and it worked so perfectly.  \n\nNow, to the piece de resistance of Commander's:  the service.  I have never in my life received such wonderful, almost perfect service.  They gave us adequate time to make selections, made suggestions when asked, made sure that we received each course of our meal at the same time--I mean exact, same time, and I would say that the room's six or seven servers each visited our table in some sort of way.  Commander's has this down to an art form, and it a wonderful thing to witness.  I even left the table for a moment to use the restroom, and when I returned, they had taken away my old napkin, and replaced it with a brand new one.

One with super long, fluttery eyelashes (read: faux) and smoldering eyes. I, unfortunately, am not competent when it comes to fake lash application nor at creating the smoky look... sigh.\n\nI first stopped by the MAC counter, knowing full well that they make the best fake lashes and are awesome at creating a theatrical look (also - they're relatively inexpensive among department store cosmetics brands). But alas, they were booked solid and a sales associate at Chanel coaxed me to her chair. After asking what the minimum spend would be to get my make-up done (3 products or $75), I restrained my inner thriftonista, remembering I was also on a strict time budget. Proceed, lady in black!\n\nAnd so she did. 45 minutes later, I was transformed into a va-va-voomin' vixen with a sexy, smoky eye, mile-long eyelashes (purchased from MAC), what appeared to be cheekbones (oh, hello!) and a demure, rosy lip to balance the strong eye look. Now, for my (not really necessary) product picks: blush, liquid eyeliner and a Glossimer lip gloss. Total cost? $112. Gulp.\n\nBut my make-up endured the test of 12 hours out and my new Chanel products will last much longer. When shopping at pricey department stores like Saks, it's best to go in knowing exactly what you need as saying 'yes, I'll take that!' just one too many times can easily result in a 4-digit spend.

I went to Total Serenity yesterday for a massage, and it was a horrific experience.  I'm trying to be gentle, because the woman who took care of me seemed to be somewhat nice. However, she has absolutely NO EXPERIENCE with professional massage. I get better backrubs from my 7 year old niece.\n\nI would have to agree with one of the other people who posted before me who said that the masseuse had no technique, just straight up and down rubs.  At first, I thought this was just her way of prepping or warming up my muscles. I kept thinking to myself,\"Okay, NOW the real massage will begin!!\" LOL. Well, after saying that about 20-30 times, I knew this woman didn't know the first thing about a REAL massage. This made me mad, because my back and neck were full of stress knots.\n\nWell, the worst was yet to come.  She moved on to my legs and started doing some crazy technique that made me want to yell out in pain!!!  I get massages fairly often at other places, so I'm pretty sure she was doing it WRONG. Every person who ever massaged my calves and thighs did it in a relaxing way to get the kinks out.\n\nOn top of that, I think this woman had a BUTT FETISH!!!  LOL. I'm laughing right now, but I wasn't laughing yesterday.  As she massaged my thighs, she made sure to end each stroke with a handful of my butt.Each time, she stroked it slow and sensually, almost like she thought it was turning me on!  EWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I don't want that kind of massage from a woman!!!  It was sooo unbelievably uncomfortable.  \n\nI felt bad, because my bf gave me the massage as one of my birthday gifts, and instead of leaving the salon relaxed and refreshed, I felt even more tense and stressed from clenching my butt cheeks every time her hand grazed and caressed it. When it was over, I couldn't get to the exit FAST ENOUGH!! lol. To add insult to injury, she had the nerve to hand me an empty envelope, indicating that she was expecting to get a tip.  Well, I ended up tipping her a few dollars, because in the end, I usually DO tip people when I receive any kind of service. Trust me, I would have rather kept that money in my wallet. \n\nI understand that for some people, the butt massage is no big deal, but I would have preferred to be asked. Don't just grab it and HAVE AT IT without my permission. This experience has me so jaded, that I doubt I will ever go to a spa for a massage again. I'll stick to Massage Envy and places in the mall. They do a better job anyway and for much less money.\n\nOh, and forget about trying to get an appointment here. It took me two weeks to get mine, because no one answered the phone during business hours, and then when you leave a message, no one calls you back!\n\nDo yourself a favor, don't go to Total Serenity for a massage.

One of the things I know I'll miss about Philly is access to all of the unique cafes I've grown to love. It's nice to know I can get breakfast/brunch that's just as good as those places at the Turning Point. What a great little find.... and quite a surprise, I might add.\n\nMy fiance' and I were in NJ house-hunting when we decided to stop for brunch.  We both decided we were sick of all of our regular go-to places in the area (Silver Diner, Grand Lux, etc.) and decided to check for a place we hadn't been to yet on Yelp. Lo and behold, my fellow Yelpers have once again turned me on to a winner!  Turning Point is a great restaurant, for the most part. However, there are some not-so-great things that I need to address.\n\nWhen we walked in, we thought it was really cute and especially liked how sunny it was inside, courtesy of their sunroom ceilings.It was cozy and charming..... in the FRONT ROOMS, that is.  Unfortunately, the front room was not where we were seated.  Instead, we were led to one of their rooms in the back, where seating was cramped, the floor was wet and sticky, and there was no sun whatsoever. I have to admit, I was a little disappointed because it's such a cute restaurant. That little room in the back is definitely a downer. It's next to the kitchen, it's noisy, and you really feel secluded from the the rest of the restaurant. Normally, this would ruin my entire experience, but the Turning Point WAS able to redeem itself.  \n\nHow, you ask?  Well, the food. It's DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!   I had the OMG, which was \"dipped wheat french toast with dollops of pumpkin cinnamon mascarpone, toasted pecans, caramel drizzle and chopped Virginia smoked bacon.\" My fiance had the Huevos Rancheros, which is kind of his \"usual\" when we eat out. He said it was the best he had ever tasted, even better than Sabrina's in Philly (which is our favorite cafe for brunch).  \n\nWe also ordered fresh squeezed valencia orange juice, and I had a cup of breakfast tea.  The Turning Point also has lots of gourmet hot drinks, such as expressos, hot chocolates and loose leaf hot teas, and cold drinks, such as a variety of iced teas and coffees, smoothies and shakes, and fresh squeezed orange juice (as I said earlier) and lemonade.  \n\nSo, yeah... this is really good place to have brunch. You will definitely find something you like on their menu.  Just remember, take my advice and ask your waitress NOT to seat you in the back.

I sat at the bar, since I was alone, and the bar always feels right for diners that.... dine alone (a table for 1 is too depressing for me to even fathom).  When i sat down at the bar a menu was already made available to me.  The bartender was cordial, and I use that word because I don't want to say she was overly friendly, mean, or any of the other emotional extremes.  She simply was just THERE.  She took my drink and food order very systematically, and I began wondering if she may have been a cyborg (and this was before I had my drink).  \n\nNow onto the important tidbits.  I ordered the Veal Piccata as my entree with a  side of pasta (garlic and olive oil), and the lentil and sausage soup to go along with.  Overall, the food felt very pre-prepared and reheated frozen-like.  It was fine, just the typical overly salty, overly rich sauces you would come to expect from Italian chains like Olive Garden, Macaroni Grill, and Bertucci's.  The side of pasta I mentioned before that had the olive oil and garlic was wayyyyyy overcooked and had close to maybe 4 cloves of garlic chunked up throughout it, talk about overkill!\n\nI hinted at the style of service I received earlier, and I wanted to talk about that more since it was the most memorable aspect of my trip.  The service, overall, had a very cold quality to it, not inviting,happy, or hospitable at all.  I guess it's a typical mentality for these restaurants which is a shame since it all probably boils down to the patrons being pretty cheap and not even tipping the standard 20%, which can lead to a disenchantment with good service amongst the employees.  At least that's why I think the typical chain-restaurant worker isn't that good.  There was also another bartender behind the counter that was dealing with all the dining room drink orders that came in.  I could sense the tension that he gave off, he seemed so miserable and the tone of his voice was borderline seething.  Although when it was time to get the check, he was very (surprisingly) polite towards me.\n\nOther highlights of the meal included receiving the wrong soup the first time around and the bartender yelling across the bar to waitstaff passing by, practically begging them to pick up her bar orders from the kitchen (it wasn't like she was busy at all, with me and maybe 4 other people at the bar).\n\nLong story short, don't expect sensational, and don't expect comfort, at least at the bar.  I digress slightly since I have eaten in the dining room at this specific Carrabbas location and the service was some of the best I have received at a chain restaurant.

This was such an important day as we are expecting and he had to leave the next day for training out of state. I asked for a romantic spot.

She gave him a very complete exam and talked me through every step of the way. There was never a feeling of being rushed out so she could get to another patient and her placid, conversational demeanor instantly put us at ease. \n\nJust as much as Dr. Majeska cares for pets, she's clearly got a thing for the environment. This brand new facility boasts a green roof, environmentally sound architecture, reused plastic bags, and paperless billing, to name a few features. \n\nAfter diagnosing the pup and suggesting a system of attack (he's got a growth on his paw and his ears are chronically itchy), we proceeded on to the medication I should start giving him. I agreed with all her suggestions, which sounded totally logical, and upon paying for all the antibiotics, pills, ear cleaner, ear medicine, and doctor's exam, the total came out to $150. Seriously, that's nothing compared to what I had calculated in my head. \n\nThe staff was beyond cordial and Giles and I couldn't have been more happy.

It was packed but not crowded where there was a line out the door.  We were seated quickly and ordered our coffees and beignets.  We could see the guy making the beignets behind the counter and he only made them when they were ordered so we got piping hot fresh beignets that were chewy and crispy all in one.  We ended up ordering three plates to split between four people because we loved them so much and had to have it before we left.

You could tell that these were regulars, some of the musicians on stage would call others in the crowd, asking \"Where's your trombone?\", and telling people that they need to \"Hurry up and get up on the stage!\" The jam session quickly turned into a trombone vs. trumpet battle.

After living in Santa Barbara for three years, we thought it was about time to try the coveted \"Julia Child's favorite Mexican restaurant.\"  We went for the #2 (steak tacos), #16 (the special with marinated pork, cheese, and grilled peppers), and #18? (guacamole and two tortillas).  We loaded up on the fresh salsas and eagerly awaited our order.  There was plenty of seating (specifically, lawn furniture) in the semi-covered patio.  We were there at around 4:00, so it wasn't too busy.\n\nWhen we got our food, we couldn't wait to dig in.  The #16 is definitely not overrated.  SO tasty.  LOVED the peppers.  Would definitely order it again.  The homemade tortillas and the guacamole were certainly tasty.  I loved that we could literally watch our tortillas being made from scratch as we waited in line.  The steak was pretty good in the steak tacos, but we'd probably try something different next time.  The salsas made everything taste better.  And we got a generous-sized cup of water, which is a lot better than those mini cups that most places give you, to make you feel bad for not buying a beverage.\n\nThe whole meal for me and my boyfriend was $13 - quite the deal!

A conference center and hotel, Gaylord Opryland offers ample walking paths, multiple restaurants, a river boat ride, a salon and spa, and now a water park as well. It is quite the labyrinth and is easy to get lost despite the signposts peppered throughout, although this often makes for the best exploration. While the hotel isn't located in the heart of downtown Nashville, it isn't a terribly far drive either.\n\nTaking a stroll through the atriums is like being in a tropical oasis. There are multiple waterfalls, streams, and lush foliage. While I have no idea what any of it has to do with Nashville itself or its history, it is quite lovely. The strategically placed oversized guitars feel a bit out of place, and yet seem more authentic to the local flavor. Compared to Gaylord Palms in Orlando which actually has decor centered around Florida (Evergaldes, Key West, and Saint Augustine), I felt less of the connection to the city here. However, I can't deny that the hotel is still quite picturesque. Visit around Christmas, and the entire hotel is bedecked in holly and strings of twinkling lights as well.\n\nLike any major hotel,\u00a0Gaylord Opryland\u00a0\u00a0comes with its pros and cons. The parking is high on my annoyance list, because although it is ample, it is pretty steep extra on top of the cost of your actual room. Whether\u00a0you are a short term visitor, or a hotel guest, expect to pay around\u00a0$32 a day.\u00a0Also the restaurants are plentiful (think Italian, Mexican, sushi, and a grill), but none are particularly great. They do have Starbucks on premises if you are short on time, but walk or drive across the street to\u00a0Nashville Coffees\u00a0for a better selection and more interesting options.\n\nIf you are staying on business or at the hotel for a conference, the conference center is massive and quite convenient. There is more than enough space for an exhibition hall and smaller rooms for more intimate talks. WiFi is available throughout the area if you need to sneak away to get work done on your laptop. Speaking of the WiFi, you can also connect throughout the grounds or in the hotel rooms, and they have a direct wired connection if you need something faster, which makes a better choice if you need to connect to a VPN or are on a call.\n\nThe rooms themselves are comfortable, although certainly some sections are better than others. For example, a room in Magnolia may have you in a fairly basic look (your standard outdated hotel) and a view of a courtyard/pool, whereas in Delta the rooms seem to be a bit more modern, and if you're lucky you can get a view of one of the domed areas, which makes for great people watching.\n\nWorth visiting at least once, even if you aren't a hotel guest!

Other varietals include adjuncts ranging from vanilla beans to maple syrup to raspberries.

For those unfamiliar with meads, or those just wanting to try more of their masterful libations, I highly suggest grabbing a flight. The menu is ever changing, and often includes limited offerings that may not be available otherwise. Each mead is quite distinctive and may range from fairly dry to on par with a Sauternes.

The Mill is one of my brunch go to places when in the area, offering some of the more innovative items I've encountered. \n\nFirst, you should know that they do not take reservations, so if you would like a table, I'd highly recommend arriving early.  The only tiny niggle in an otherwise perfect plan, is that you cannot order a cocktail in the city before a certain time, so although you may be guaranteed a seat, their delightful libations may be out of your reach.  I actually first tried some from this restaurant at a cocktail competition in Miami, and they definitely know their stuff. So for the drinks at least, you may want to make a return visit. \n\nAs for the food, I typically struggle with what to order as the changing menu is filled with tantalizing dishes. Typically I end up sharing with the table so as to increase the number of options I can sample.  If they have it let me just say that the Vegetarian Crack cakes are sure to hook you whether or not you actually are a vegetarian.  A combination of zucchini and squash pancakes, topped with preserved lemon crema, guava onion butter and a sweet pea salad, they make me believe that I could give up meat and still be blissfully unaware of what I'm missing. Thankfully this item seems to be a menu constant.  Although the sweet options change too often to recommend a particular choice, I'd like to note that options like the banana bread french toast with rum raisin compote and coconut dulce are worth ruining your diet for. Although not every selection is total nirvana, you're more likely to find hits than misses, so be sure to give them additional chances if your first experience seems to be a bit lackluster.\n\nWhether you are a local seeking for your regular breakfast place, or a visitor looking for a high caliber new choice, The Mill is undoubtedly the restaurant you want.", "date": "2016-11-20 05:40:11"}, {"_key": "3225860", "_id": "reviews/3225860", "_rev": "_fNy0Be6--S", "review_id": "zO5vNWKzXc-lzTlKJdKIWg", "user_id": "q7iWal_rXNSHkHeCMMvZxQ", "business_id": "uYMVRPYEqpmVXWN2xOs5KQ", "stars": 3, "useful": 9, "funny": 6, "cool": 7, "text": "Wine bar meets restaurant, it sounds like a perfect match.  \n\nAfter doing some research, I discovered that this is a Illinois based chain, where they produce their own wines, and then serve them in the restaurant as well.  If you want a table, I would recommend making reservations in advance, or just resigning to sitting at the bar.\n\n The wine tasting room is right at the entrance, and is definitely a lovely piece of tasting room eye candy. Style-wise it competes with any number of higher-end wineries.  Wine tastings are fairly inexpensive, and ranges from $7-$12.  They do seem to offer quite a broad range of wines, with an especially large number of sweet wines.  Personally, I decided to spring for the \"Lux\" flight and found almost none of them to my liking, but everyone has different preferences.  I don't think there is anything wrong with cheaper wine, and in fact, I believe there are many great wines that are relatively inexpensive.  That being said, there just wasn't much complexity, and there seemed to be unpleasant lingering aftertastes with many that I tried.  I also didn't appreciate that my entire tasting was a sales pitch for my server, during which time I was forced to endure endless droning about the perks. \n\nWhen I finally got around to dining, the menu seemed on par with your average chain.  They have a variety of options, and large portions.   The food is quite competent, and will definitely satisfy hunger.  Cooper's Hawk isn't organic, gastronomic, or tapas-style, so don't expect it to be.  Also, yes, they only serve their own wines, but this makes sense to me considering that is the whole point of the venture.  Additionally there are some cocktails if you really are not feeling wine.    \n\nThe pretzel bread that is served before the meal is a bit more interesting than the standard crusty Italian bread loaf.  It is a large soft, pillowy bun of pretzel dough, which can then be slathered with the slightly sweet butter.  Also, I did receive excellent service throughout my meal. \n\nCooper's Hawk is not the place to come for wine experts, nor for a truly gourmet dining experience.

While the brewpub does offer some of Cigar City's brewery beers, they also have a selection of their own unique beers as well. Not only can you drink a cold brew there, but you can also fill a growler to take home later. In addition to the standard Cigar City fan memorabilia, you may also be able to snag a bottle of something special (read \"rare\") from the fridge on your way out.\n\nNot really in the mood for beer? No problem, they have wine and cocktails as well. You can even combine the two with their beer cocktails. \n\nFeeling hungry? The food menu is quite varied, with some Latin-flair and plantains thrown in for good measure. Burgers are offered a couple of ways, or you can chart your own destiny and choose the toppings. The Cuban (Ham, mojo pork, Fiorucci salami, Swiss, mustard) is a great version of the classic sandwich, and the upgrade to yucca fries with aioli is well worth it. The Chicken Saltimbocca delivers grilled chicken breast wrapped in prosciutto, fresh sage and smoked gouda, served over a wild mushroom risotto with a choice of vegetable. I thoroughly appreciated the addition of the sage, and the creaminess of the risotto. They also made a very tender Ropa Vieja (a slow stewed flank steak with peppers, onions, and tomatoes served over black beans and rice, with sweet plantains). For dessert, Hunahpu's Imperial Flourless Chocolate Cake is quite dense, but the acidity of the berries cuts through some of the richness nicely.

Since Paxton is only a month+ old, he's still in a carseat, and doesn't make much noise, but because of this, we needed a place to put him.  The tables are too small to fit four people, plus a carseat, and we couldn't slide him onto the bench seat.  The one table that had an extended bench was open, but wasn't cleaned, so they said we couldn't sit there.  Fine.

So relaxing and such an exhilarating feeling after grueling Bonnaroo. \n\nSome of the exciting perks about Club-Hotel were their mini fridge and microwave, which allowed us grab some groceries and make some make-shift lunches for ourselves, their on-site laundry facilities - which allowed us to bring back clean smelling clothes for our journey home, the complimentary shuttle which took us back to the airport, and their complimentary wowing breakfast spread.\n\nEach morning we would tiredly drag ourselves downstairs to indulge in a breakfast display that made our hearts beam. With a waffle maker on hand, hot eggs, sausages, homefries, cereal, muffins, bagels, fruit and more - we would go to town every morning - fueling ourselves up for mid-day pool lounging.

After leaving my car there for one week, I received it back with only half of the work done.  There evidently was a dispute over what the repair center and what my insurance company were supposed to do, and it does appear that my insurance company bears some responsibility.  My primary concern is that when I spoke directly with the person at reception about having the repairs done, she neglected to tell me that there was a problem and that she needed additional information. Instead she told me everything was all set. I think she was overwhelmed and just wanted to move on to the next waiting person.  A week later, after having been told the car was completely repaired, I went to pick it up to find only half the work done - and, had to find this out myself.  No one at the repair service told me that they only did one part of the repair.  Poor, expensive, assembly-line service is what you will get at this place.\n\nReview Update:\nAs Shawn at Don Brown mentioned, after posting this review, I was immediately contacted by Pam in Customer Service.

Phillies are dedicated fans and it defiantly showed. They came out hours before the game and sat in the rain til it started. We watched the Phillies vs the Washington Nationals on Monday, May 21st. It was funny routing for the Nationals the day before. We arrived over two hours early and they had already opened up a limited section of the park. We got a drink at Harry The K's the restaurant in left field named after Hall of Fame broadcaster Harry Kalas. You can sit and watch the full game there as long as you keep buying. We watched the Phillies batting practice and walked around the park as it opened. We had seats on the very top level (4 levels!) and it was high up there, still a great seat...but almost a touch of vertigo. The whole stadium felt huge. Capacity 43,651, but it felt like 50+\n\nThe video board in left field was so clear and massive, apparently it's the largest HD screen in the National League.  It also wouldn't be Philly without a replica Liberty Bell.  It \"rings\" and lights up after Philly home runs and wins. Unfortunately, we didn't see either. The Nats won. Another Philadelphia quirk is that their bullpens are in the outfield amongst the fans. When they first opened in 2004 the Phillies bullpen was closest to the fans and after Philly fans booed their own pitchers (these are the same fans that booed Santa Claus) they switched to have the visitors section closer for heckling.\n\nThe mascot always needs mentioning. Its rates high on my husbands list. The Phillie  Phanatic....a green beakish creature. The Phanatic has been named the best mascot before and he did not disappoint. He was absolutely hilarious. He came out with a full rain suit on when it began to sprinkle. He mimicked and danced with middle school cheerleaders. There are also videos of him traveling to the Galapagos Islands...his birthplace.\n\nAll in all, the stadium might not have a beautiful backdrop of the city, but it was still a beautiful park.  Its very open and you can see the game the entire time you walk around the park.  There were so many options for food (love the cheesesteakes!) and the craft beer was endless.

Yeah, that's why it's normally served in courses, you know, the bread followed by the appetizers followed by the soups and salads followed by the entrees and side dishes? Nope, not this time.

Standouts were the squash soup, burrata mozzarella appetizer, scallop BLT, and the absolutely HEAVENLY mashed potatoes. The steak was fantastic too, and my mom loved whatever non-steak item she ordered... I think it was chicken, although it might have been fish.

I knew that.  Neither was Rotier's.  But my handy Yelp app had assured me that Fido's was open.  Imagine the disappointment when I realized there was a very real possibility that no burgers would happen on this trip down to the Deep South.  Would I really have to wait two more weeks when I would find solace in East Texas?   \n\n\"We can try Burger up,\" I mentioned.  \n\n\"Why don't you just call them?\" hissed the appropriately nicknamed Viper.  \n\nTrue.  We didn't have to keep driving around aimlessly.  So I call Burger Up, and a very pleasant, sweet voice assures me they are indeed open.  \n\nViper: \"What was her name?  She sounded hot.\"\n  \nMe: \"Paige.\"\n\nViper: \"Yeah, she's definitely hot.  Have you ever met an unattractive Paige?\"\n\nMe: \"Good point.  At least we have that going for us.\"\n\nPaige was indeed attractive, but this review isn't about a photogenic individual who happens to work at Burger Up.  It's about what ended up being a visit to our fourth choice for burgers in Nashville.  \n\nBurger Up follows a national trend towards upscale burgers.  My particular order consisted of a medium rare patty served with aged cheddar, Benton's bacon (very good), and ketchup served on an artisan bun.  Basically, it was a gussied up bacon cheeseburger, but it was a rather tasty one.  My major complaint is that I wish the actual meat itself exhibited more flavor.  Having said that, the burger was cooked properly and the flavors worked well together.  I ordered some wilted spinach on the side (mediocre) and truffle fries.  Let's talk about those truffle fries for a bit.  I know more people are apparently into the sweet potato fries here, but I think they are missing the boat.  Burger Up's truffle tries have pleasant aroma, taste great, and are the perfect texture for soaking up oil.  If you are on a diet, it is true you should skip these delightful fries.  But if that were the case, why are you at a burger joint in the first place?  Seriously, if you get nothing else out of my review, please do yourself a favor and order the truffle fries.  \n\nBurger Up also boast an interesting beer menu with semi-obscure breweries from the Deep South included in the list.  I tried a pecan-infused amber from Mississippi - not bad.  I could imagine Burger Up could be a decent place to drink for a bit after eating.  \n\nIf I attended Vanderbilt, I would probably go here on a moderately frequent basis.

It was all pretty standard until I reached the gumbo.  \n\nLi'l Dizzy's gumbo is heavenly.

Nashville's unique contribution to Southern cooking entails the preparation of fried chicken basted in a fiery combination of peppers and spices that absolutely will send you running to the closest fire hydrant to squelch the burning sensation where your lips and tongue once resided.  Mr. Bolton will make you hot chicken from almost any part of the bird, and he will even do it with chicken tenders should you choose (which comes with the welcome addition of ranch sauce to alleviate some of the heat).  I opted for wings and a call to the fire department.  \n\nAside from the heat, it should be mentioned that Bolton's approach favors flavor.  The wings themselves were fried perfectly and reminded me why I frequently hold my head in only mildly feigned agony when eating \"Southern food\" in places like my current hometown of Washington DC.  The green beans at Bolton's, flavored liberally with bacon, were so impressive that I ended up ordering green beans at nearly every single restaurant and dive that I visited in Nashville.  I assumed it was a Nashville thing; I was wrong -- it is a Bolton's thing.  Maybe some pseudo-celebrity chef should visit Bolton's and say it was the best thing (s)he ever had; it certainly was the case for me when it comes to green beans.  The mac-n-cheese is also very nice with heavy use of white cheddar and liberal amounts of black pepper.  If you like a \"bready\" mac-n-cheese, this is probably not your style.  I thought it was delicious.  \n\nMr. Bolton himself was an appreciate and friendly man who probably should have been annoyed that two rather inebriated individuals were awkwardly ordering (ex. me: what's the one that is hot chicken?  Bolton: i can make any of them hot chicken?  me: ok, i'm confused now) but he helped us out anyhow.  I know Nashville loves this business, but if I ever find out how to teleport people, Mr. Bolton is coming to Washington DC.  But at least you got my lack of an advanced degree in any engineering on your side.  Outside of a moment of idiot savant-like genius on my part, you are probably safe.  \n\nFinally, although it rarely happens, there are a few somewhat misguided reviews that lament that the chicken wasn't spicy enough when they ordered MILD or make similarly obvious patently illogical complaints.  There is a saying that the inability to appreciate the Mona Lisa speaks more about the criticizers than the actual work.  I feel the same way about the plebeian fools that dare to defile a culinary gift from the Gods (or, in this case, a gift from the able hands of Mr. Bolton and his staff).  Bolton's is divine and is a foodie must for anyone visiting Nashville.  Unless you are vegetarian or hate chicken, to visit Nashville and not try hot chicken from Bolton's is about as despicable as going to Vanderbilt and cheering for the University of Tennessee.  It simply should not happen under any circumstances.  As for locals, if you haven't been here, then I would highly recommend that you support this culinary gem of a local business.", "date": "2012-01-03 16:04:12"}, {"_key": "3198287", "_id": "reviews/3198287", "_rev": "_fNy0AmO--b", "review_id": "fmet4HphmADVS24Gk6ok4w", "user_id": "K7thO1n-vZ9PFYiC7nTR2w", "business_id": "Z8qGOmU8YxDjLPBbrz84Yw", "stars": 5, "useful": 9, "funny": 4, "cool": 11, "text": "While I will readily admit that gelato isn't exactly my first love, I can still appreciate the obvious work that goes into the preparation of the creations at Capogiro.

I commend Capogiro for providing both options.  Third, the price point is correct.

Yes, it's absolutely touristy.  Yes, the trashy shitshow that is Bourbon Street spills off of the street and directly into this venue on a regular basis.  But if there is a better karaoke experience than Cat's Meow anywhere in the country, I've yet to see it.   \n\nNow I've seen some people complain about the drinks here but Cat's Meow knows its audience.  Namely, the idea of serving drinks in glass is simply a terrible idea when you have patrons so obviously beyond their usual limits.  To wit, by the time we reached the second floor to take a Roman Colosseum view of the events below, two girls from a bachelorette party - one the bride and another an aging bleached blonde with a silicone chest - were fighting for crowd attention and eventually each other (silicone kicked the bride on the karaoke floor!).  No one wants glass in a venue like that.  \n\nBy the way, if you don't particularly care to karaoke or dance, may I strongly suggest this second floor?  From our original vantage point, you get a bird's eye view of all the lunacy.  For example, we watched a horrific breakup (the girl grabbed another man's you know what right in front of her man), people falling on stage, the best drunk dancing ever, and the obligatory drunk people coupling from the balcony.   \n\nThe range of songs offered by Cat's Meow is quite good.  But what really makes the event are the MC's who bring the party back every single time after a bad song.  These dudes can sing, dance and are pretty much a bachelorette's dream as they are pretty sculpted too.  Their ability to bring energy back into a place is borderline magical.  \n\nIt was my friend's b-day, and I was proud that she left the second floor and was having fun dirty dancing with the MC's.
