I am accustomed to huge two story locations with day cares, tons of mirrors, full locker rooms, pools, saunas, packed schedule of classes.  Now the offset of that (back in the day) was that you were in some crazy contract for ever and paying 40-60 bucks a month.  Although pricing changes for each location and depending on the placement of the moon and the sky, most people at anytime fitness have a 1 year contract for between 20-30 bucks.  So, you know, you get what you pay for. \n\nAt this location, as compared to my experience at Bullard location, you may get a little less than you pay for.  The space is extremely cramped. That being said the equipment is quality equipment, they do have the standard classes, and it is generally clean. There are no lockers just cubby holes by the member entrance/exit door.  The parking lot can get crowded when the dance studio and dojo are having classes.  The classes fill up and it gets dangerously crowded and hot in the studio.  There is one shower.  Fortunately, I haven't had to wait for cardio equipment.  Most of the people working out at the time I am there are in class or are on weights.\n\nI think the most annoying thing about this location is the service. By the time I arrive at 6 or 7 in the evening, the staff has zoned completely out.  They are nice but not at all proactive.  The first time I went to this location, one of the members let me in the front door and I stood there for a good 2 minutes before I had to then go in to the office and say, hey I am here on a free pass.  No tour was given, no information about classes (until I asked), no policies, and no membership prices.  I loved that it wasn't a hard sell but I expect 1) for people to be aware of people coming in and out of the locations and 2) for you to care and follow up with me on whether I had a good experience or not. Also, with the classes, the teacher was late and her music skipped.  However, everybody has an off day so I am going to reserve my final opinion on that.  Especially since her zumba choreography was fire!\n\nFor me, working in CBD and living in New Orleans East, this location is more convenient because I can stop there on my way home.

I've been going here for almost 2 years and the staff is incredibly nice.  I've been a gym member since I was 16 - at Aquatic Fitness Center, LA Fitness, The Firm (of Marlton, NJ), and Planet Fitness.  In all my years, I've never been greeted by name with a high five and sometimes a conversation.  They've got my schedule down, they know when I'm coming in for the most part, they even know what I'm reading.  And not in a creepy way.  They know I love my spin classes and when I come in they hand me over the red class card immediately because they already know that's where I'm going.  They've even got my keys memorized!\n\nI utilized their fitness assessment when I first joined, and I got really worried that I was going to be pressured and ostracized until I bought a personal training package.  Not the case at all.  Tony was super helpful, and had a ton of information, and there was no beef at all when I didn't want to sign up.  He's still friendly, fixes my form if he sees me, and he too also comments on my reading ha.  \n\nSpinning Intructor Carl is another amazing staff member.  His classes are energetic, and even though it pisses me off that he'll call me by name to sprint (or call me out on not going fast enough) he challenges me to perform and that pays off.  He's inpsired me to get my own certification that I'm very excited to utilize.\n\nThe gym itself gets crowded after work hours, but the parking isn't terrible and there's street parking on Green.  Their hours are great, and they open at 5am during the week...meaning their desk people are there at 4, jeez.  Their equipment is up to date, there are tv's on every machine, they play uplifting music and football on the weekends on the gym TV's.  They have a juice bar with a 4square special, and there's tanning --something that I haven't taken advantage of.  They also have circuit training classes with a trainer at a decent rate, and there's member appreciation events every month.  I mean they REALLY appreciate their members...they give us alcohol!

I used to play lacrosse. (Sure, I rode the bench, but I still practiced like a winner.) I used to strength train with a former Romanian World Cup soccer player who looked eerily like John Travolta from Pulp Fiction on many, many steroids. (True story; 2006 was a weird year for me.) I used to eat right, drink plenty of water, and take all my essential vitamins. I was young, virile, and full of energy, ready to live a long and eventful life free of prescription medications.\n\nAnd then I discovered beer.\n\nYears of the sauce coupled with limited time for exercise (Damn you, soul-crushing job!) made me into a pretty average, pretty chunky little twenty-something. Recently, I decided to do something about it. \n\nI began researching the plethora of gyms scattered throughout our fair city, only to discover that waiting tables could never afford me any of them. I heard great things about some of the bigger chains (*cough* SWEAT *cough*) but I simply could not afford their monthly rates. Then an angel in the form of a buddy from work told me about an incredible deal in Northern Liberties. Given how much I missed being in shape, I had to check it out, and I did just that.\n\nI've been going 4 times a week ever since. \n\nNow, before we talk about the machines, the size of the place, or the classes, let's head off on another path. If you (yes, you) are a follower of my few reviews on here, you may have noticed a theme: I have a secret love for personality displayed in the staff of the spots I frequent. (If you noticed, gold star for you. If not, accept it as absolute truth and carry on reading.) Anyhow, the first thing you notice upon entering City Fitness is the staff. And this staff has definite personality. Everyone smiles. Everyone greets you. If they remember you from the day before, they let you know. If they saw you doing a weird exercise, they ask you about it. Here's the important part, kiddies: THEY MAKE YOU FEEL WELCOME. One of the biggest problems I've encountered in the gyms I've attended in the past has been a general feeling of indifference emanated by the workers. They didn't care whether or not I was there, and I was therefore usually too intimidated or put off to ask them for assistance. Often, this little indifference is what caused me to cancel my membership. Somehow, I don't foresee that happening at City Fitness.\n\nThe gym itself is huge. A converted warehouse, it has a little bit of everything. The main room consists of the weight section (combination of free weights, benches, and varying machines), the cardio section (50-something pieces of cardio equipment, each with their own LCD TV attached), a stretching/aerobic section (that could admittedly be bigger), and the smoothie bar, which boasts some of the best original recovery shakes I've ever had. They even create specialty recipes for the holidays! Trust me, you're sorry you missed the Thanksgiving Pumpkin Pie shake.\n\nAside from the main room, City Fitness also has dedicated spinning and yoga rooms, each adorned appropriately, as well as a multi-purpose room used for many of the classes offered.\n\nWait, did he just say classes? Yeah, he did. CF has a lot of them. They offer the traditional fare, like the aforementioned yoga and spinning, as well as some more cutting edge classes, like kettle bells and core-centric bridal bootcamps. (Not my cup o' tea, but hey) Different trainers handle different classes, each according to their own personal specialty, and from what I've seen, they kick your ass.\n\nNow, that last sentence implies that I don't actually take the classes offered. I don't, and the reason for that is because they cost extra money when added to your monthly membership. Ah, the catch... Actually, most things at CF add a few dollars to your membership fee to utilize fully. Classes, towel service, and locker rentals all increase your very reasonable starting fee and make it... still incredibly reasonable. Seriously, I've done the math, and even if I were to add the fee for taking classes to my membership, I'd be paying less than a basic membership at Sweat. That, friends, is superb.\n\nSo, if you've been following along, you've come to realize that City Fitness is a large, friendly wellness center with a little bit of everything for everyone that won't break the bank and is easy to get to. (It's literally 40 paces from the Spring Garden El stop.) The question is, with this information in hand, why the hell aren't you there yet? When you do go, look for me.

CityFitness sets you up with a one month trial membership. This is awesome because it's not just limited to the spin classes offered on the pass, and you can utilize the gym for any of the services available to a trial membership. \n\nMy experience with the trial membership was fairly frustrating. I have a gym in my building so all I really wanted to do was take spin classes. Recently CityFitness switched to an online class sign-up system. I'm sure it's convenient for members but it's not available for anyone with a trial membership. Trial members have to call up the front desk and request to be manually added to the class list. For both members and trial members, each class opens 24 hours in advance. \n\nThe sign-up process doesn't seem like a big problem, however I was a huge fan of the 6:30pm Monday spin class with Steve. CityFitness closes at 6PM on Sundays. By the time the gym reopened on Monday morning, the class was typically full.\n\nThis speaks very highly to this class and the instructor, Steve. I enjoyed every moment of each class I was able to attend. He is lively, enthusiastic, motivating, friendly, encouraging and just overall fantastic. When my husband and I first started, we took the beginner class where he took the time to teach us proper set-up and technique. Aside from being a great teacher, his music selection was killer. I could only imagine what a bad song set could do to a class, but his music selections were upbeat and perfect for spin. \n\nI wasn't thrilled with the spin studio itself. Throughout my experience I personally came across some faulty bikes, from pedal straps that wouldn't tighten to seats that wouldn't adjust. During one class, one classmate was spinning so hard that a pedal broke while he was on the bike. I'm not sure if/when it was fixed but that eliminated one spot in the class for however long it was out of commission. \n\nSo long story short: Steve rocked but based on the condition of the studio and the billing issues I've heard about, I will not be buying a membership to CityFitness.", "date": "2014-07-15 16:18:18"}, {"_key": "1847324", "_id": "reviews/1847324", "_rev": "_fNyy3wW--U", "review_id": "wixNfXALmvclhtVCgS5tkg", "user_id": "WQKrEnngxC-RnJw7Py9GZg", "business_id": "Tm3QiAVLJAR2fEJK7APPPQ", "stars": 3, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "So, I decided that I wanted to try out City Fitness and I figured being a former Ballys member it wouldn't take much to be better!

Also, their spin studio could use a remodel and upgrade - they may want to look at competitors that are creeping in from NYC (e.g. Fly Wheel) as something to aspire to since spin has become super trendy in the past couple years.

I went in to redeem my voucher and take my first class yesterday.\n\nI arrived at the gym around 5:20, thinking this was plenty of time to fill out any paper work and get ready to attend the 5:45 \"Beginner Spin\" class. I had to stand at the front desk for 3-5 minutes before anyone even acknowledged me, then was not very warmly welcomed when I explained my reason for coming in. The computer systems were slow and had to be \"cross-referenced\" at two different desks (not really sure why, nor did I get an explanation or apology for the inconvenience). Anyway, I was finally brought my waiver form, filled it out, and was asked to screenshot the groupon on my phone and send it to the representative's personal email (again, not sure why, as I already redeemed it with her when I walked in).\n\nOnce that was taken care of I wasn't offered a tour of the facility or given a towel that were being handed to every one else who walked through the door. In fact, I wasn't offered anything. As soon as I was done with my paperwork the woman assisting me told me to have a great work out and sat back at her desk. I had to ask where the locker room and spin room were on my own.\n\nAlready frustrated with my front desk experience, I was still hopeful I would have a good class. I got into the spin room at 5:40 for the 5:45 class, only to find out it had already started! And the class wasn't just warming up, they were clearly already into their first or second song. This was also frustrating as the class was on the schedule from 5:45-6:30. There were a few others who entered the room after me too, who seemed just as surprised to see the class already in full swing.\n\nI would consider myself an intermediate spinner, but if I was truly a beginner, this class would not make me want to try spinning again. There was barely any interaction from the instructor, and we repeated the same hurdle sequence for every song. The instructor didn't push the class to add resistance, or switch up the sequence (I'm used to spin classes varying between hurdles, long distance hills, sprints, etc) and if I did not have prior experience I would not have known how to push myself on my own. And that's one of the reasons most people opt for group fitness instead of working out on their own...the added push of the instructors and peers. This class wasn't very communal. Not to mention the music selection wasn't my cup of tea...lots of indie and classic rock, which I love listening to, but quite monotonous for working out especially if you're not being motivated by your instructor on top of that.\n\nAround 6:10 the instructor said we'd do one last song and then cool down, so even after arriving earlier than the designated time, I barely got a half hour of spinning in. At the end, I asked another instructor who was in the class helping people get set up on their bikes (I think his name was Steve...he was pretty nice) if it was typical for the class to start early, and he said yes. If this is normal, the time should be shifted on the online schedule and the schedules hanging up around the gym so that members can plan accordingly.\n\nI still have 9 classes left on my Groupon and I'm hopeful I'll have a better experience than this one, but looking through the rest of the Yelp reviews, I can't say I'm too optimistic.", "date": "2015-07-21 14:46:11"}, {"_key": "1959597", "_id": "reviews/1959597", "_rev": "_fNyy8J6--E", "review_id": "LMEzOadu9IGnKhu7mth9dw", "user_id": "DUBv7QttaqWJzEStX_q04g", "business_id": "Tm3QiAVLJAR2fEJK7APPPQ", "stars": 2, "useful": 5, "funny": 2, "cool": 0, "text": "Nice looking gym. \nSkews on the meat head, frat boy side.\nA gym where \"no cell phone \"use is not enforced. \nMuscle boys on cell phones.

Increasingly it is becoming the few \"paid trainer\" folks sprawled out in one area and the many \"non paid trainer\" folks crowded in the rest of the gym. Not cool no matter how many pool parties you throw. The regulars are the reason this gym is even popular. Don't forget that.

I pay $29.99 a month for unlimited classes.  I joined because I wanted access to yoga classes without paying yoga studio prices.  I had to pay a $39.99 fee additionally after three months membership to \"secure\" my monthly price.  Another thing that I like is the atmosphere, as another reviewer said it is not too commercial.  It feels non-judgemental and \"normal\".  A lot of the people who work there are really nice, especially Ellie, Carl, and Sam.\n                                Now onto why I chose 2 stars, instead of 3.  On any other day I probably would have chosen 3, but right now I am very upset at their spin class policy.  Because their spinning classes fill up so quickly, they have recently instituted a call list system in which you must call and reserve your spot in class.  On Friday I called at 3:30 to reserve my spot in the 5:30 class.  I was told I called too early and to call back later.  I called back at 4:14 and was told the class was full, oh well.  Tonight I had planned on going to the 6:30 spin class.  I called at 5:03 and was told the class was full up and that I could not attend.  I asked them how it was possible that in 2 and 1/2 - 3 minutes 20+ people had called and reserved spots.  The girl on the phone told me that there are three phones and three people answering them and that 6-7 people on each line had beaten me to it.  Then she told me I could go to Zumba instead if I wanted.  No thanks.\n                                       That annoyance aside, spin class is usually great.  Carl and Ellie are my favorite spin teachers, as they are both fun and challenging.  Ellie is really the best thing that gym has going for it.  Not only is she a great spinning instructor, she holds other classes, like \"Sweat, Tone, Sculpt\", which is a combo of aerobics and light weight training.  She puts 100% into every workout and doesn't allow anyone to slack.  She is the best fitness teacher I have ever encountered, anywhere.  If it weren't for her classes I might have just told the gym to take their spin classes and their 29.99 a month and shove it up their toned asses.\n              Clearly I do it for the classes.  That being said, I'm not an expert on the quality of the weight lifting machines.  They seem pretty normal to me and are never very crowded.  The treadmills, eliptical machines, and bikes are not many in number.  If you are someone who prefers to run on the treadmill but can only get to the gym after a 9-5 job, this is very challenging.

I asked to speak with someone from the billing department and the employee said they would have someone call me back....3 days later and what do you know, still no call. \n\nI used to have a membership at Philadelphia Sports Club.

I should have walked right away!\n\nSo the deal at the time was $99 to sign up and $59.99 a month thereafter.  I am an avid reader of contracts, and I pointed out the many loopholes to them before signing it.  I was assured it was a very casual contract, they were a neighborhood business, and they weren't going to screw anyone over.  What a convincing little song and dance.  Well, I believe in giving people (especially neighbors, and so called \"neighborhood businesses\") the benefit of the doubt, so I signed up because they were conveniently located and had yoga classes.  And for 6 months, I happily went to my yoga classes and paid my bills.  \n\n...Until one day I come in and find out it's going to cost an additional $10 a month (in the middle of my contract!!) to continue to attend those yoga classes.  Pretty shady, right?  Whatev.  Since they bailed on their own contract, all I want is a refund of the initiation fee, and a refund of the last 39 days I'd prepaid upon signing up back in December.  They've decided to ignore that request.  The excuses they've given me on the phone are piss-poor, and one member of their staff even got verbally abusive on the phone.  \n\nI highly recommend you check out the neighborhood message board, northernliberties.org, before considering a membership here.  I'm not the only one to complain (just the first one on Yelp, for some reason).  Here's one recent thread in particular: http://pub50.bravenet.com/forum/4226496069/show/637106\n\nIf City Fitness does the right thing and refunds my money (and reconsiders cheating its members in this manner) I would update my rating to 3 stars.  There are a lot of excellent things about this gym, and there are a lot of things that leave a foul taste in your mouth.  Here's the short list: \n\nThe good: \n- Many of the yoga teachers, including Lisa, Kelly and Mark, are fabulous and I miss them.  \n- The TVs & vents atop each aerobic machine are nice \n- The overall gym vibe is nice, full of neighbors, not meatheady\n\nThe bad: \n- The gym has some cleanliness issues.  Yes it is new so it looks new, but get close up to a yoga mat: they don't get scrubbed down and you can smell an interesting, unique sweat bouquet on each one.  Dust bunnies float about like tumbleweed, too.  The bathrooms are often out of toilet paper and I used a shower once and told myself never again, ew.  A professional cleaning company really needs to be hired here.  \n- When machines break, they should be fixed promptly.  Some of the treadmills were very shaky.  Some of the TVs and air vents don't work. \n- The nickel-and-diming across the board is very annoying.  How about providing towels for the prices we are paying?  Or the full shampoo/soap/conditioner range in the showers?  And the website still says a juice bar is \"coming soon.\"  I was told it was \"coming soon\" in December and it's still not been worked on.  Oh, and the tanning bed costs extra?  They should clearly state what is covered in a membership before people sign up.  Because all things (that you don't know up front) considered, it's not that great a deal. \n\nSigh.

I find the gym to be very clean and the sauna is just lovely after a workout. \n\nAs far as shady contracts and such, I asked a lot of questions before signing up. I fully understood that use of the yoga studio required the deluxe membership and that the tanning bed was also an additional fee. I was just looking for a place to workout and take the occasional cardio class so that didn't bother me.\n\nI'm only giving the gym 3 stars because while I love working out there, I do think I should be able to take a pilates class for the $45/month I pay.

I explained my situation again; the representative told me that the person I previously spoke to should not have accepted a phone cancellation, but she assured me that she would take care of it and everything was fine.

I was confused... was my 20 minute speech not clear enough for them to mention this? Were my cries not enough to be told about this option? I spoke to three different people that night - neither said a word.\n\nOh well, I filled out the form, and jogged my way back the next day. Again, it didn't work out... the form is only for the local residents, they said, and I live in NYC. But nowhere I saw that on the website (NO, I MEAN IT, Here is the link and if you find anything about the requirement of being a resident, I will personally venmo you $20 (http://go.cityfitnessphilly.com/7-day-trial)). Someone even called me after I submitted the form, and he said he'll make sure I get in. But it didn't work.\n\nAt this point I know they remembered me :D because as soon as I walked in I could tell they were annoyed  -- judging by them avoiding eye contact, and avoiding conversation with their \"sorry bro - wish I could help bro - I understand bro\"\n\nListen, if the management is reading this: we both know you're not making your money off the $20 one time sessions. It's the monthly/yearly plans that makeup your revenue. It's the people who pay the huge amount on January 1st, and never show up. But you just lost a customer who's enthusiastic about going to the gym and working out. \n\nYou had nothing to lose from letting me work out there for a day or two. I'm not even asking for free. But 60 dollars for 3 days?! \n\nI mean it when I say I want you to be a successful gym. But I showed up twice, talked to 4 people total, said \"please\" wayyyyyy more than anyone should for going to the gym...\n\nAnd I'm sorry... your $6.50 'protein shakes' were not that great to make me wanna come back.\n\nI just wish we could be friends.", "date": "2017-03-23 02:43:09"}, {"_key": "2382113", "_id": "reviews/2382113", "_rev": "_fNyzYbK--K", "review_id": "JnwxXZg_r7ueMdeynttAnw", "user_id": "Qy4qBiz_ZjNaEl8-uNmhwQ", "business_id": "Tm3QiAVLJAR2fEJK7APPPQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "I go regularly to the Graduate Hospital franchise.

I saw their website and was like \"wow this place looks awesome and its right down the street from me\". For I didn't know a simple thing as a gym membership would stress me out for months to come.\n\nI would like to say also I do not wish harm to this gym, I hope it does succeed and this is my honest review. I hope these reviews help the owner or whomever to realize and improve their businesses ways. For me, my bad experience was customer service and billing. 1st of all NO ONE joining a gym wants to get stuck in contracts. People have stress in their everyday life and when getting done work, going to the gym should be worry free and stress free. They have to worry about real bills and real stress with everyday life, no one should have to stress over a gym contract. They want to simply pay monthly and when they want to leave they're able to leave. This gym randomly charges you $100, after 90 days as a lock in fee? Then they charge another $100 to cancel since I made poor choice of signing up for a year, which I did expect to stay for a full year. I actually did recommend a friend to this gym when I was in my 1st month and I was suppose to get a free month after that but somehow I never got that free month and was still being billed regularly. I contacted them, make long story short and gave up after awhile cause it was just ridiculous.\n\nGoing in I was told when you sign up you have 30 days to complete this list of things and if you do you get $5 off your membership every month. I told the girl, \"I'm actually going away for a week in 2 days, and would it be better if I signed up when I come back, so that when I get back from being away I can actually get everything done on the checklist and have the correct amount of time I'm suppose to have? She said \"no need, I'll make a note so that we don't start your membership till when you come back.\" So I sign up, go away for a week, come back and within that month from my start date I completed everything on my checklist. When bringing my card in I was told I was a few days past and they wouldn't give me the lower $5 rate. I told them what happened and that the one girl said it would be fine and explained the story to them and they told me \"no, she wasn't suppose to do that and I'm sorry but you cant have the discounted rate.\" So off the bat I'm already furious with this gym. \n\nI couldn't imagine those who paid for a trainer, thats another locked in contract, which when I took the free class (on the checklist) I kind of felt forced to sign up, but I didn't, thank God. Talk about pushy. The guy told me the entire time \"don't think about your finances, we'll handle it and make it work... blah blah blah. He asked me if \"finances did not matter would you sign up?\" I said \"of course, I would.\" Then he asked me how much I'd be willing to pay. I told him and he basically went on about how I could pay what they wanted and how I could cut my living cost so I could pay it. In my head I'm like is this guy serious? I just wanted to get out of there by then and they had me still fill out this paper work asking me my fitness goals and just being really pushy trying to get me to sign up. I knew when walking out of that trainer session that something was wrong with this gym.\n\nPeople want a gym that cares about its customers and not about locking them into contracts and sucking their money dry. Thats why I joined another gym cause this gym stinks. They need to get rid of fees for people who want to leave and their 90 day \"lock in\" fee. Plus get it together and teach your employees what good customer service is. Stop being pushy and make people feel welcomed and comfortable.", "date": "2017-05-15 22:18:47"}, {"_key": "2457208", "_id": "reviews/2457208", "_rev": "_fNyzaz6--Q", "review_id": "qkXDv5Lw4Wh8QvzWVkIWDw", "user_id": "P94TxI8PXfebkUpOei1voQ", "business_id": "Tm3QiAVLJAR2fEJK7APPPQ", "stars": 1, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Where do I start....there are not many good things to say.

I won't get into the previous problems because those weren't issues that should be attributed to current management. But it is worthwhile to note that there is a big contrast.\n\nFor what the gym provides--various cardio and weight machines plus ample free weights; studio for floor work (BOSU, orbs, mats, more free weights kettle balls, etc), spinning bikes and classes; non-gender bathroom and gendered bathrooms with showers--I think my membership is a good value. A feature of Anytime Fitness that I particularly like is that one can truly go anytime. I've been on holidays and at 12midnight and felt safe and secure even when alone in the gym. \n\nWith Anytime only one short block from the Monon, on nice weather days I like to run the trail then duck in for upper body weight lifting.

This place is huge with lots of parking, but I imagine it can be packed on weekends. IncrediPlex has a lot of variety of activities. Our experience was during a holiday off from school and with the games and blow up things. The kids can play on the blow up things for $6 Mon-Thur and I believe a dollar or two more Fri-Sun. For kids 2 and under, it's free. And for a good reason. \n\nThe kids I take care of are 2 and 5, even though the 2 year old tried the monkey slide a couple of times, she didn't like it much afterwards. Plus she's on the small size, so it's a bit of an extra challenge for her. It was great for her brother, I think overall I'd recommend this for ages 4 and up.\n\nSince we went on a Monday, they had a special with the game card. Put $10 on the card and they'll match it. And they don't charge you for the card either. The games were in a range of prices from I believe $.50 to $1.50, maybe $2.. I like that they list how much a game costs at the game and how much you have left on your card after you swipe it to play a game. I feel like it's easier to keep track of compared to Dave & Buster's. With the card you can play the video/arcade games, I feel like you can use the card to do the bungee jumper and the climbing wall. I think the laser tag is apart of that, but I can't recall. So those might be a little bit more than the other games, but not bad. Plus you win tickets and there's a machine to collect and count your ticket amount and put it on the card so you can get the usual toy fair.\n\nThere's also a bowling area near the games with at least half a dozen bowling lanes. Also a snack concession and an adults bar area. There are multiple tables to sit and eat, as well as numerous leather chairs and couches to sit and watch your kids play. And there's wifi, you just have to ask for the password as it's protected. This place is also geared for birthday parties.\n\nAdditionally, IncrediPlex has turf fields, hardwood courts, sport court, modified baseball/softball diamond. Plus there's an indoor fitness center. I didn't see all these areas, but what I did see looked impressive.

No thanks. And in the day it's not much better. So, the only reason I have gone there is for my daughter's volleyball tournaments. What I LOVE about going to Incrediblex as opposed to the other places that have hosted the tournaments is that they give you a players card worth the amount of your admission fee, $5. The place is really ginormous, soccer, basketball, batting cages, and all this is happening all at once, under one roof! They even have a full service restaurant. No, you can't order a steak and there's no waitress to serve your table, it's deli style ordering with a cute area of umbrella'd tables where you can eat everything from wings to sandwiches. Or, you can sit at the bar and partake in some wine and beer and although this is the only area designated 21 and over, you can drink outside of there as well. I saw dad's with beers in another table area watching sports. And I find it ask kind of funny. Yes, please serve parents alcohol while they watch their kids sporting events then have them drive home, lol! (And I am oneif thoseparents who partook becauae sometime a nice cold beer is just what an all-day volleyball tournament required. But, in all seriousness, no, I think the alcohol and food stuffs is about drawing in the Dave and Busters type of market without the D&B type of price. Unfortunately, they don't have the gaming and high end bar feel the other establishment can brag about;  BUT they have a lot more variety. They have bowling, inflatables, Lazer tag, and when the courts aren't being used the kids and I hopped on a court and played pepper (meaning you can just free-play between games). From what I understand they also have a gym? And open gym for the kids. \n**My only worry was having my teen daughter dropped off for open gym at a place that serves alcohol and has sooooo much to offer. It's a great place.  But as a mom, she likes to go and well the freedom to loiter and wander (20-ish age guys have been \"recruiting\" and now \"befriended\" my 16 year old daughter and her friends for open gym nights) worries me.**\n So, I'm a fan, wish it was closer, think some things might need to be reworked to keep bad situations like young girls being preyed on (precautionary), parking is more than sufficient (if you keep driving past the entrance you'll see that there's a whole lot behind the building (and the exit is one way so you have go that way to leave anyway),and I like how you can roam around watching and even just hanging around until the next game uncorralled (still love that part). As for the staff, tourney and restaurant staff have been courteous and seem to run things smoothly and they're usually busy.  To sum it up, my biggest beef with Incrediblex is its locale,  but, from what I've seen the patrons don't reflect the location, once you're inside you could be anywhere USA. So, would I recommend it?

They're group classes seem to be timed to be just after school starts so it is convenient\n- Staff seem to be flexible with your needs if within their restricted hours.\n- Entire JCC is enclosed so at least you know when your child is running outside, there is minimal traffic and no strangers wandering about\n- Your child's tuition covers the cost of gym membership for you and spouse\n\nCONS:\n- Lunches are supposed to be nut free AND meat free\n- Lots of school closures for both christian and jewish days off\n- Lots of random rules (ex. if your child is wearing a skirt on gym day, forget it. She will be sitting on the sidelines)\n- Classes are not anywhere close to racially diverse. AT ALL. \n- Restricted hours: for any household with two working adults, you will have to deal with a 9a to 3:30p day care schedule with an \"early care\" option starting at 8am. This is pretty unbelievable considering the car traffic around here. \n\n\nFOR THE GYM:\nPROS:\n- As above, the link with the daycare seems to be the best reason to use this place\n- Sauna (but it is co-ed)\n- Several group classes offered\n\nCONS:\n- Everything is outdated even though they apparently just renovated the bathrooms. \n- Kiddie pool is kind of a joke... it's just a shallow outdoor pool that is covered with a thin film of dead flies and leaves\n- No towel service\n- The place reminds me of a YMCA ... from the 1960s. \n\n\nOverall though, I'm still using this place primarily due to location convenience and the ease of working out.

Apparently \"Some restrictions apply\" means they do not actually have to honor the full promotion.  Their only reason for not honoring the deal was that supposedly part of the promotion applied to their Cathedral Oaks location and part of the promotion applied the Santa Barbara location.  There is no mention of this distinction on their promotion but I suppose that is how a bate and switch works.  When I presented my screenshot and demanded that the promotion be honored in early January the promotion was immediately pulled from their website.\n\nI understand that people can make mistakes.  A web designer can make a typo, a sales person can speak incorrectly or a business can misjudge the potential response to a promotion.  What I don't understand is why absolutely no concession is being made and when I question the ethics of their behavior I am laughed at.  Beth in membership actually laughed at me today on the phone!  She asked whether I seriously thought that I could pay no dues for 6 months and join their club for 75% of the signup fee.  Yes, Beth, when your promotion of which I have a screenshot advertises such I very much expect you to honor it.\n\nHow much would it really cost them to honor their promotion?  How much would they stand to gain by having an additional member after the promotional 6 months had passed?\n\nTo make things worse this is the second time I have fallen victim to their poor business ethics.  In mid-2011, I spoke with John Youngblood at SBAC about signing up my fiance and he offered a discounted sign-up fee yet when we returned the following week John Youngblood was no longer there and the price was not honored.  At that time, Robert Graham had the decency to take me seriously and made a generous offer of guest and class passes in exchange for my fiance signing up at the full price.\n\nIf it's happened to me twice then chances are it's just a matter of time until it happens to you.\n\nSanta Barbara is too small of town for this.", "date": "2013-02-22 22:00:12"}, {"_key": "2356449", "_id": "reviews/2356449", "_rev": "_fNyzXr2---", "review_id": "EVTb2o95G3HHW0lg7yAleQ", "user_id": "HT65K2F9Cow9xqLBRsO2NQ", "business_id": "6jomGWEI4ryImrWPguUQQQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 5, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "A great place!

I was a member from 1998 to 2015. I see some of the negative reviews are older. Others just have no standard of comparison, clearly. Free coffee and cream, for instance, you will never find at Equinox. I miss the old cafe of course (and bar); in the 1990s, I ate here more than anywhere else in town. \n\nSince I left, they put a million at least into the locker rooms. Indoor was always a smaller room (with an oddly large dry sauna). And hallelujah! The boys and girls switched. Our locker room (\"outdoor\") was so much smaller than the guys' room. They also had a bigger steam room. \n\nIt's just beautiful. Same lockers as Equinox (no more padlocks, woohoo). The flooring is fantastic. \n\nAlso, thankfully, someone decide that the orange in the weight room adjacent to the locker rooms was a bad idea. Some orange remains in the boot camp room but it's fine. \n\nCardio upstairs is SO much brighter.  I remember when that room was a cave. \n\nThe treadmills are by the left-most squash court. Star Trac is a brand of treadmill with which I am unfamiliar. I'm a fan. They even have one of those treadmills for marathoners. Woodbine or something. I'm not a fan but the variety is excellent. \n\nSince I joined on New Year's Eve, I've never seen over 15 people at the club. The whole club! \n\nI know some people are sad that classes were closed but they're open now in a tent by the parking lot. I never took classes so it doesn't matter to me. \n\nI also am baffled by the complaints about price. At 159/month, it's less than the Bay Club (LA/SF) and wayyyy lower than Equinox. The same cleaning people are there (plus some new ones) and no one could possibly say anything negative about these lovely humans. \n\nThe managers and desk people are all new since I left. Terrific youngsters at the desk. They removed the Power Plate (a drag) and one girl at the desk was quite indifferent/unable to answer questions. Big deal. I don't need every person at a business to be perfect. \n\nThe pool is wonderful.  Best pool in America I've swum. The view of the lemon trees and the trees over the parking lot feel like home to me. I cannot begin to guess how many miles I've logged in this pool. Only when you move to NYC do you really appreciate the length of this pool. I think it's 68 lengths to a mile (about 5 alternate side strokes). So nice not to have to turn around constantly. Jacuzzi jets work---always. \n\nThere are no towels right now. That's a drag but you get used to it. (The Bay Club has towels so this is not a Newsom issue.) Steam and sauna closed but everything else open, indoors and out. \n\nI think SB people just don't know how good they have it. When you move to New York you really do appreciate just how excellent a club this is. And it used to be more country bumpkin. It's quite sleek now .\n\nCody is a terrific personal trainer (who started at Williamsburg Equinox). I got a free session when I joined. The initiation was just $199 at Xmastime. \n\nThe 1 star review is absurd and should be removed. It's a club. Of course you have to be a member. \n\nI joined for 12 months (to get the $159 rate). Originally I had intended to be here 9 months and it worked out about the same for the contract and non-contract. \n\nBut I was expecting the club dues to have jumped at least to $199, so I was overjoyed to find out that even after all the money to renovate the locker rooms, the rates stayed where they were. \n\nAlso, while LA clubs were closed, SBAC was open. They deserve ALL the gratitude in the world for this. Again, Santa Barbarans just don't know how good they have it in the gym department. New York opened gyms 9/2 but LA has been closed except for gyms with outdoor space. \n\nI love this club. The minute I walked into the locker room, I smelled the familiar scent of cleaner. A flood of memories washed over me.

Is it the best athletic club in Santa Barbara? Maybe? ... Is it comparable to any other high end athletic club in a major city, definitely not! \n\nThe club itself is dated. The equipment is dated. The locker rooms are dated. The group exercise classes are often out of touch. There is a lot of potential. With the right investors, ownership and management this could be a great club but as it stands now, SBAC is on par (and it many areas under par) with your standard run of the mill gym. There are gyms in nearby cities like Los Angeles and San Diego, for example, with up-to-date, state of the art equipment in pristine, clean condition offering memberships at $10 a month. \n\nSBAC survives in Santa Barbara because no one has built a better alternative and if you're an SB native, you may not even be aware of what you're missing. In that case, ignorance can be bliss. \n\nWithout a major renovation, here are a few things that could be improved immediately. \n- CLEAN the locker rooms thoroughly multiple times a day, daily. There are areas in the ladies locker room collecting so much dust and grime it looks like they have not be cleaned in years. \n- CLEAN the equipment multiple times a day, daily. (It amazes me that in a \"high end\" club like this, I have never seen staff wiping down equipment in almost a year. This is a standard practice even in most bargain gyms.) \n- Improve customer service, starting with...a smile. It's easy, watch :) There are a couple of good staff but the majority of the folks behind the front desk spend their time talking to one another, (sometimes whilst folding towels) while guests are waiting patiently to speak with them. \n- Train staff to monitor supplies and keep them stocked. Almost daily, if I want to utilize a complimentary water cup or grab tea/coffee, there is always something out of stock. Be it a cup but no lids, straws but no cups, cups but no coffee, or some confluence of the above. (This will prevent guests from having to go back downstairs and interrupt your gossip/flirting sessions happening behind the front desk in order to ask for those items to be replenished.) \n\nIn terms of renovations, I'd love to see the ladies' showers improved. The water pressure trickles out and halts when someone flushes the toilet, hooks instead of rings, add a fixture in the shower for folks to set their razor, shampoo, etc if they bring their own toiletries, an opaque shower wall would be nice. (I don't need to see the woman in the stall next to me scrubbing her ass crack and I'd rather not be on display to her as I scrub mine). Replace the flimsy shower curtains with heavy duty curtains that don't blow and stick to ones' body. Invest in quality, standard towels (or better) and get rid of the tiny, brittle towels currently offered. Guests will use less towels if they are larger and more absorbent. \n\nNow for some positive attributes. This is a club for all ages. It does not matter if you're 19 or 119 years old, you will have peers at SBAC doing fitness things throughout the facilities. You can feel comfortable joining with the entire family, your teens, your parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, or even your great-great grandparents. No will feel out of place. It's truly a club for all ages. \n\nA few pro-tips: \n- Ladies, lift weights! Diversify your workout for optimal results. Ignore the chauvinists in the weight room who think building male muscle is more important than a woman building hers. (Beware you may find yourself replying, \"Yes, I am using this equipment that is in my hands.\")\n- Bring headphones with ample volume for the cardio room UNLESS you want to be serenaded by a woman who likes to go to the treadmill closest to mirrors and sing loudly for all to hear as she makes faces to herself in the mirror while walking on the treadmill. \n- Don't be alarmed if you open the door to the sauna in the locker room and discover a member of the staff, fully clothed in their uniform sipping a Big Gulp and playing on their phone in the dark. I guess there are not many places for unenthusiastic employees to hideout on the clock.\n\nAnd if you're ever looking for a what a five star experience at an athletic club is supposed to feel like, go visit FIT Athletic Club in Downtown San Diego.

Not going to lie, I wanted a gym close to me this LA happened to be a gym close to me. Hardly a match made in heaven but it was a match none the less. Looking like an easy sale did not stop Derrick from giving me his all and it's really presentation that blows me away. So the kids got to hang out in the Kids Klub and I got to tour and sign up. I got a lot of great advice along the way from Derrick. Sign up was a breeze, price was just right. We got some Kids Klub action, some personal training action. We we set! \n\nLittle in the middle but she got much back. I'm a bit of a curvy girl ... ok so I have some serious curve in the hip. I don't feel judged. I feel judged A LOT elsewhere in life. Here, nope. No one cares, they are doin their own thing. I like it. So we have a personal trainer, a master personal trainer even, who is just great! Mason works on more than just the repetitive movement, he really breaks it down to the basics and helps you with proper movement. The best thing about him is he is so encouraging and not in the boot campy, harsh or angry way. I really feel true commitment to not wanting to disappoint him. Don't tell my husband (who trains with me) but seeing Mason is the highlight of my week. I kid, I kid. We have found true pleasure in exercising together. \n\nMOMS AND DADS ... Kids Klub. Wow. The people in there are so awesome. I'm not a fan of leaving my kids with strangers. These guys don't stay strangers for long and each one of them are so awesome with the kiddos. Secure. Yes. Secure.

I was so inspired by this staff that I am now a nutritional sciences major. I feel so awesome and independent my fitness journey now and I'm not afraid to ask for help at that gym. I still go to LA Fitness sometimes, because it's on a family membership plan, but I feel really really awkward around trainers at this gym. \n\nI feel like I'm definitely more knowledgeable in the gym, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with getting help from a fitness professional. In fact, I would encourage you to approach an LA fitness coach. This was just my experience. If I were new to a gym and read a review like this, I would feel more confident in knowing details about a place and people I'll be spending my time around.", "date": "2018-07-07 21:07:03"}, {"_key": "2426148", "_id": "reviews/2426148", "_rev": "_fNyzZpq--A", "review_id": "Ju1Tn-wI1gryurgzc_paxQ", "user_id": "R7NM7vIyUfSTXvMsw7jNTA", "business_id": "mWv9wdM5OD7tiDzf3DkyXw", "stars": 4, "useful": 4, "funny": 1, "cool": 4, "text": "This is a real nice gym.

The group of people that work out are very friendly and range in ages from 20's to 70's.  For $115.00 monthly fee, you can work out at any of their locations 6 days a week which rounds out to about $5.00 a an hour long session.  I think that's a fair price since most personal training sessions are like $50.00 and above.  Basically the week days are split up to cater to certain body parts.. Monday is lower body workout, Tuesday is upper body workout, Wednesday is cardio day, Thursday is lower body workout, Friday is upper body workout and Saturday is whatever the teacher wants to do.  They break up the workouts by always moving and changing things up so your body never gets used to 1 particular workout.  There are also 2 different groups.  There is a phase 1 and a phase 2 group.  Phase 1 does more modified workouts than phase 2 and you have your choice as to what group you would like to work out in.  Some days if I'm hung over, I'll do phase 1.  It's completely up to you.  The instructors are all VERY well versed on anything that has to do with form, fitness, etc.  If you have any questions or aren't doing a particular excercise correctly..they will let you know in a nice way.  Just recently I needed help on doing arm circles above my head..my hand eye coordination sucks..it was funny.  They also motivate you when you are slacking or when they know you are about to quit.  Even a little \" come on guys!  keep moving!\" can really lift your spirits when you think you are about to die.

In March 2020 I decided to joint Crunch Fitness on Bloomingdale. Of everyone knows COVID happened shortly after. During the state wide shutdown I attempted to find a number to call crunch in order to cancel my membership because my wife is high risk. Of course there are no general contact number because the gym is franchised.  I tried contacting the gym during the closer and was unsuccessful. So, on Monday May 18, 2020 Gym's opened as well did crunch fitness. I called them at 0800 to cancel my account. They said in order to cancel I would have to go in person or send a certified letter.  So after work at 3pm I stopped by. I learned that as of that day everyone in crunch was charged $27 which was ok if I was going to use the gym. I talked to the AM and explained that I won't be using the gym at all because of my wife's status and asked if I could be refunded my money because of COVID. Their response was \"no, we are not giving any refunds. If we gave you a refund we would have to give everyone a refund.\"  So I spoke to the GM. At this point I just wanted my account canceled. She wouldn't cancel my account because when you initially sign up there is a 90 day mandatory period. Fine my $27 takes me to my 90th day but I still wouldn't be using the gym. The GM said oh btw in ten days you're going to be charged approximately $45 for your annual fee.  Wait what? I explained that it's not that I don't want to use the gym it's that I can't again due to my wife's condition. GM then mentioned she may need to contact her manager and get a doctors not about my wife's condition. I've called everyday since to get an update from the GM and have been unsuccessful because the GM is always busy but won't return my calls even though I leave my information. Finally someone talked to me and relayed messages between the GM and I on the phone because the GM Kirstey won't take the call. I was told \" Kirstey has already passed your information to her manager and he will get back with you. We no longer have access to your account and can't change the active status.\"  There was no guarantee that the annual charge wouldn't be charge to my account nor that I would get my $27 back and my account was still active. I will never join a gym again nor will I ever recommend crunch to anyone.\n\nUpdate may 23, 2020- \nAs of yesterday I noticed that crunch never charged my bank account the $27 like I was told (they weren't supposed to anyway because I only authorized my credit card to be charged).

Brian gets on the phone, I tell him it's best if we cancel membership because our child can't stop crying in there child care all of the sudden( first month I did 2 a days and he was completely fine playing in there. No issue) all of a sudden one day we started having issues and the girls had to get us almost every time we went. We stopped coming 2x a day and shortened our length to 20-40 min workouts. Nothing was working. Brian's response was \" why didn't you cancel it before you left here?\" I said \" I wanted to make a rationed decision and not in the heat of the moment\". He said well you're going to have to come back and sign a paper being you are 2 months in your membership and contract is until 3 months we won't charge you your last month but your fees for this month are in process so we can't stop it. Ok whatever, next morning I drive 10 miles to crunch just to sign this paper. I walk through the door and janell at the front desk tells me there's no paper to sign and her and Saul don't know why he told me to come sign a paper. So the outcome was I drove there for no reason, Brian never sent the email to corporate to close both my husbands & my account. I called up the next week janell sent an email the next week got charged again called janell up she sent corporate another email they refunded the money they took out. It's 2 months later and I'm getting charged randomly again.

In March 2020 I decided to joint Crunch Fitness on Bloomingdale. Of everyone knows COVID happened shortly after. During the state wide shutdown I attempted to find a number to call crunch in order to cancel my membership because my wife is high risk. Of course there are no general contact number because the gym is franchised.  I tried contacting the gym during the closer and was unsuccessful. So, on Monday May 18, 2020 Gym's opened as well did crunch fitness. I called them at 0800 to cancel my account. They said in order to cancel I would have to go in person or send a certified letter.  So after work at 3pm I stopped by. I learned that as of that day everyone in crunch was charged $27 which was ok if I was going to use the gym. I talked to the AM and explained that I won't be using the gym at all because of my wife's status and asked if I could be refunded my money because of COVID. Their response was \"no, we are not giving any refunds. If we gave you a refund we would have to give everyone a refund.\"  So I spoke to the GM. At this point I just wanted my account canceled. She wouldn't cancel my account because when you initially sign up there is a 90 day mandatory period. Fine my $27 takes me to my 90th day but I still wouldn't be using the gym. The GM said oh btw in ten days you're going to be charged approximately $45 for your annual fee.  Wait what? I explained that it's not that I don't want to use the gym it's that I can't again due to my wife's condition. GM then mentioned she may need to contact her manager and get a doctors not about my wife's condition. I've called everyday since to get an update from the GM and have been unsuccessful because the GM is always busy but won't return my calls even though I leave my information. Finally someone talked to me and relayed messages between the GM and I on the phone because the GM Kirstey won't take the call. I was told \" Kirstey has already passed your information to her manager and he will get back with you. We no longer have access to your account and can't change the active status.\"  There was no guarantee that the annual charge wouldn't be charge to my account nor that I would get my $27 back and my account was still active. I will never join a gym again nor will I ever recommend crunch to anyone.  \n\nJuly 11,2020\nStill waiting for their supervisor or someone above the general manager to call me.  I've made multiple attempts to contact Kirstey but she's still not responding to me. Don't know what else to do.

The photos on the Doylestown Rock Gym website make this gym look much larger than it is. This place is actually extremely small with a only a few walls to boulder on - the rest are for top roping.

On many of the walls, I could start and be up the wall with maybe two moves. Their setup forced me to practice traversing for two hours - which I guess isn't bad but I was hoping to be challenged, not bored.\n\nAside from the setup, the overall aesthetic left a lot to be desired, maybe the safety too. Many of the holds were totally falling apart and would slide off their screws when you grabbed them. Some of the holds were also on thinly painted walls just covered by a piece of falling apart wood - especially in their \"ice climbing\" hallway.

At least the preschoolers watching us clapped.  5.11 is the highest I noticed, but then again I can't climb more than 5.9 currently so I may just not have noticed.  Definitely a lot of good beginner and intermediate climbs though.\n\nThe gym is really kid-friendly too.  Birthday parties, parents with kids... rugrats were all over the place.  The staff is good at keeping things organized and making sure everyone is safe.  They even have a separate \"kids\" wall.  Staff is friendly in general.\n\nMy friends and I spent a good 5 hours here on a Saturday afternoon trying everything out (even took a break and ordered in pizza from a local shop).  I'm not going to switch gyms anytime soon, but it was fun to check out a new place.  Overall, I'd say Doylestown is great for bouldering and great for kids.  I'd totally reco it to anyone looking to try out climbing, check out a new rock gym, or have a children's bday party.

The scoring boards allow you to anonymously (if you wish) track your results and compare with fellow riders. I will say my first class I had a bit of a hard time figuring out the logistics of the bike and how the gears on the bike translated to the scoring system, so my initial score the first time wasn't as great as I would have hoped, but hey, still got a great workout. The \"Bar\" actually comes into play, though not in the form of a cocktail. There is a break, usually in the second half of the class, where you pick up the bar lying across your bike and get in an arm workout.

I signed up online, bought a discounted beginner package of 3 classes, and scheduled my classes online as well.\n\nThey have clip-in shoes that you can use for free (or bring your own compatible ones) that they wash after every class along with the towels (as far as I can tell). The bikes are great - fully and easily adjustable, with a light-up screen that shows you things like RPM, an estimate of calories burned, and the resistance level you're currently at, which is really useful. Each instructor has a different personality, which is interesting, so you can get some variety or pick a favorite and schedule your classes with them. You can choose whether or not your stats show on the scoreboard in class, but either way, your results get emailed to you automatically right after each class with a summary of how you did. The mood is great, with low lighting, and the instructor can choose different colors of lights. Depending on the song, there are sometimes videos on the screens up front.\n\nI also love that they have lockers to secure your stuff so you don't have to worry about whatever you bring in, free water bottles which you can fill there, and snacks - I always grab a banana on the way out for a post-workout refuel.

This gym, and the great personal trainers that work here, has shown me that I, too, can get a regular work out that I enjoy and that gives me the results I'm looking for.  \n\nFirst, this gym is well equipped, with both machine and weight systems for entry level to body builder.  Everything's in perfect working order and there is space enough so you're not on top of anyone.\n\nSecond, it's not crowded.  They're all about quality over quantity here, and that fits into my lifestyle very well.  No waiting for a machine, no trying to find an open space to do some floor work...even when there are a lot of people, you feel the gym is all yours.\n\nThird, the owner Tiffany and her staff are fantastic.  Come in and tell them what you're there for, and they'll be sure you reach your goals.  Want to hit the gym whenever you have the time, they'll be open.  Looking for someone to help you develop a routine, they'll do that and let you do your thing.  Need someone to be there to help you train, they're on it and will flex with your schedule.  \n\nI've been with FN for a while now, and I see the diversity of people that train here...professional athletes, retirees, executives, restaurant waitstaff.  But they all have one thing in common, they're all getting the workouts they want and, daresay, enjoying it.

This rec center is amazing and definitely the best gym/rec center I have ever been to. It features a new multi-million dollar gym area, A huge swimming pool (heated) and lots of chairs for sun bathers. Approximately 8-10 racquetball courts, huge locker rooms for both genders, many dance rooms located upstairs and downstairs, and indoor track, sand volleyball, a pro shop, and 6 basketball courts (one of those can be converted into indoor soccer)! For some reason the tutoring center and a restaurant is here as well but I've never been to either of those places. \n\nThe new gym is definitely the highlight of this rec-center. It is 2 stories with hundreds of machines. The atmosphere is very nice, it is extremely clean, there is music playing, and there are a lot of TVs around to keep your eyes busy. So many TVs that in fact each treadmill, elliptical, and bicycle has its own LCD TV that you control yourself. The free weights area is pretty large and is clearly defined and upstairs has a lot of mats for floor exercises. You can check out medicine balls and exercise balls from the staff. With water fountains located conveniently throughout the entire rec center to keep you hydrated this place has everything! I highly doubt you can find a workout that is missing from this gym.\n\nParking is rarely an easy thing to do because the parking lots can get extremely full sometimes but the worst case scenario is that you park in the back of the lot.  \n\nAt the beginning of each semester when everyone is in \"workout\" mode there tends to be waits for various machines in the gym. Most notably the treadmills, elliptical machines, and sometimes the free weights area gets ridiculously packed. Also on extremely busy nights the basketball wait can take an extremely long time, I remember waiting almost an hour once to play 1 game. The reason for this is because various clubs and groups (karate, badminton, volleyball, etc) will rent out 1 or 2 of these courts which narrows down the 5 basketball courts that are used down to 3 and some nights I've seen it come down to 2. \n\nAnother downside is that the rec center is only available to students, alumni, faculty or guests of any of those people. So if you don't know a single University of Arizona person, it might be hard for you to get a membership here but if you do its definitely the best deal in town.  \n\nIn my opinion the best thing about the UA rec is the basketball scene there. It is definitely has the best pick up basketball in the State of Arizona. 5 courts are usually running full 5 on 5 games on weeknights and on weekends that number usually falls to about 3 or 4. Even then that is still a lot of chances for you to get a good game of basketball in. You don't have to bring your own basketballs either because you can check one out at the rec center. \n\nOverall, the UA rec is just plain amazing its hard to describe how large it actually is when you are inside of it and with so much to do you'll never get bored here.

I really appreciated how easy the studio made it for me to find the link and that the process was seamless. Another thing that attracted me to the studio was that I was astounded with the diversity of experience, education, and the focus on mental and spiritual health that their website explained for instructors. For example, Sarah is a body positive advocate that doesn't believe in diet culture or fatphobia. She has a focus on trauma informed practices and making yoga accessible to all bodies. Her bio online says she has worked with many different organizations as a licensed master social worker. It makes a huge difference when the folks who teach trauma yoga classes actually know what they are doing versus trying to implement something they read in a book.\n\nOverall, I had a wonderful experience with the studio, even if my own computer issues did force me to have to log out early (if you're reading this Sarah, sorry about that!)

The coach is there all the time changing up the pace, keeping it interesting and tracking time out loud to the next change of pace - this makes the hour go by really fast and, when your really working as hard as you can, having someone countdown the minutes/seconds to the next change, keeps you going hard just that little bit longer. \nThey also have an optional arm or chest band that keeps track of your stats and puts them up on a TV with everyone else.

I work for as many orange points as possible and try to do better each time.  No one compares themselves (nor should) with how anyone else is doing. The leader board tells you in live time from your personally calibrated heart monitor how you are doing each moment.  So it's you doing your best and not trying to keep up/compare yourself with anyone else.  That was a huge selling point for me.

I had been thinking about it for some time, but I've tried the \"High Intensity Interval Training\" before and was not a big fan. What I hated about it before was the \"social\" part of it. I know, sounds bad doesn't it? When I go to a gym of any type, be it structured or not, I do not like to be engaged by anyone. I'm self-conscious enough just walking in the doors, I don't need someone interacting with me, to boot.But, OTF was something that I read about and saw online and thought that it might actually fit the bill.  Almost personal training without the extreme personal part and no need to be a contributing member of a group.  Your exercise is your exercise, nobody else is dependent on you and vice versa.First class was free. Signed up using their friendly IPhone app and set the date.  December 31 at 3:15 pm. They recommend you get there at least 30 minutes early to your first class and that's a great idea.  I got there a bit earlier than that only because I wasn't sure where the location was and gave myself some extra time. Walked through the doors of the Studio and was immediately greeted by a young lady (Olivia) who was expecting me.She asked me some questions, the bad ones first - age, height, weight and then asked me what my motivation was for wanting to experience OTF. How long had it been since I've exercised etc. After the questions, it was time for a brief tour, I say brief because it's not a huge place, but doesn't really need to be.  A couple of restrooms, a showering room, some cubbies and lockers (free) and the front desk/lobby area. The studio where the magic happens is somewhat bigger, it has 12 Treadmills, 12 Rowers, 12 Floor Work areas. In front of the rowers is an exercise bike and elliptical for those unable physically to handle the treadmill. In the corners were large TV screens.  No wasted space in there at all. After answering the questions and quickly meeting the Coach (Katie) I was given an \"OTBEAT CORE\" chest strap and directions to the restroom to put it on. She also took my car keys as it would prevent me from leaving with the strap.  Tip: Clip should be on the right side of your body and the Orange Theory Fitness wording should be facing up. OK, chest strap on.  Now it's back to the lobby to wait for the start of the class. People started filing into the lobby, standing around chatting. Names and heartrates started popping up on the monitors as the Bluetooth connected wearables started communicating with the OTF system. \n3:15 on the dot, Katie stands on a bench and greets the assembled crowd of people awaiting the start of the session. I would estimate 25 or so people were present.   She explained what the workouts were (to me, she was speaking Greek) and then stood at the door fist-bumping as we all walked in.  As a new guy, I had my own Rowing Machine coned off for me. (#12), that's an interesting point about OTF, what number you start with, follows you to each station.   #12 Rower, #12 Floor, #12 Treadmill. Let me offer more of an explanation of the \"floor\".  Individual work stations, consisting of a bench, hand weights (from 8# to 25#) and a TRX Strap. First Act was the Rower.  I had never been on a rowing machine before in my entire life. This was a \"water rower\", in that the resistance is provided by a circular water bowl. As you pull back on the straps (using your legs to push), the wheel spins and the weight of the water provides the resistance.  \nAfter warming up, it was to the weight floor for some bicep curls, something with the TRX Straps and some other exercises that I must have blocked from my memory. After completing one \"ladder\" of exercises, we were to go back to the rower and knock out a few hundred meters before coming back to the floor and doing it all again until time was called. I managed to stay alive until Katie brought some anti-bacterial wipes around so we could clean off everything we touched - weights, rowing handles, bench you collapsed on in the middle of the workout. Nice touch, one thing I hate about gyms is people who do not clean off the equipment after using it. \nTo the treadmills McDuff!  There are 3 levels of treadmill users:  Power Walkers, Joggers and Runners. Power Walkers:  3.5 MPH with a 6% or greater incline Joggers:  5 MPH with an incline as well, but I can't remember it. Runners: AT LEAST 6 MPH with an incline as well. \nSuffice it to say, I created a new category, \"Just a Walker\", I could not get the tread faster than 3 MPH without feeling out of control.

The hours are reasonable (I'm one of those folks who is often in there closing the place down at 11pm, or working out on Friday nights or holidays.) I have also invested in a handful of training sessions (for an additional fee) and wish I could do it more often. The trainers are great at targeting routines that are perfect for one's level (and the level one aspires to.) There is a good wifi connection, so it is easy to listen to a streaming service on one's personal device. There is a movie theater with cardio-type machines where one can enjoy a commercial film while exercising. This facility offers various classes, which I have not taken advantage of.

They have a beginner work out you can go to to transition into regular workouts, but you can just go to the regular. The head coach, Liz, is awesome and super friendly. Every coach focuses on having correct form over speed and having huge weights. The classes are very structured, so you know what to do when. Also, the coaches are always willing to demonstrate for you, in addition to giving you pointers throughout the workout. \n\nAs for being a woman in Crossfit- this is no longer a source of anxiety. There are a lot of women at this gym! A few coaches are women, there are a lot of regulars with a variety of body types- not just muscle beasts. Which is equally as intimidating as being with all men. Skills have prescribed weights for women and for men, and you are able to scale further as needed. \nThere is a new crop of people coming in every few weeks, and so there is no need to be shy. \nThey've also built a great culture of camaraderie with an ice-breaker question before the workout, and partner work outs are awesome.", "date": "2013-05-24 16:19:01"}, {"_key": "2061229", "_id": "reviews/2061229", "_rev": "_fNyzAOC--Q", "review_id": "byMQq2gImxKXm56U7VdETA", "user_id": "P4oGqCkYJ6a_LRheCUVUaA", "business_id": "POn8Xzda_26vDYAmaEJMQA", "stars": 5, "useful": 5, "funny": 2, "cool": 4, "text": "I ran 4 times a week for 3 years.

I started when I first got pregnant and now my son is 13 months. Wow, does time fly.\n\nMost recently, we attended a one year old birthday here. It was perfect! Here was the set up.\n\nWe ran in 15 minutes late (of course. Btw how were all the other moms on time? I honestly thought we would all be that late.) The class had already started and kids and moms were dancing on their yoga mats. I really respect places that are timely!\n\nWe had about 30 minutes of yoga/body movement to music (about 45 minutes for everyone who was on time). Then we had some refreshments the mom brought. I thought it was over at this point, but no, we had more structured play with a giant parachute! I thought it was a fantastic way to structure the birthday for one year olds - they have the attention span of squirrels so that food break was a necessity. \n\nAt the end of the party, Mallory, the owner, told everyone to stay as long as we liked, but of course being moms of toddlers, everyone ran for nap time. However, it is a good feeling knowing you are never rushed to leave. \n\nAfter throwing Yoshi's first birthday at my house this year, this seems like the perfect alternative for his next birthday. They have a cap of 12 parents/kids (so a total of about 25), which makes sense for the space. \n\nWe had a blast and the class was perfectly suited for the age of the kids.", "date": "2019-10-29 14:25:03"}, {"_key": "2202257", "_id": "reviews/2202257", "_rev": "_fNyzFWW--H", "review_id": "Hn6RPyTr5R6IDHurm2D5uw", "user_id": "-kLVfaJytOJY2-QdQoCcNQ", "business_id": "ZuM1vcZ_ObCjCCGweYzItg", "stars": 5, "useful": 10, "funny": 2, "cool": 6, "text": "Very calm and gentle prenatal yoga class.\n\nEven before moving to Westchase one of the first things I did was look up gyms. When I struck out with that and got pregnant around the same time I started narrowing my search to prenatal yoga classes. Even though there are three yoga studios in the generally vicinity, this was the only one that listed prenatal yoga classes on their online schedule. I bookmarked it and decided I would try it soon after I moved.\n\nI had two reasons I wanted to do prenatal yoga classes. 1. I'm hopeful it will help make it an easier birth. 2. I wanted to meet other pregnant women. Note that neither of those reasons was to get a good workout. I've been to yoga classes where I get a killer workout, but I figured prenatal class would not be one of them (spoiler alert, I was right).\n\nYou can sign up for class online which makes it easy when you check in. I got there about fifteen minutes before the beginning of class and the door was locked. I freaked out that I misread the time, but it turns out it was locked from the class before and the teacher quickly opened the door for me. \n\nThe studio is small but has a very calming feel. There were about eight women in my class and they all seemed to be between the end of their first trimester and their second (nobody was extremely pregnant in my class). The women and the instructor were all super friendly. I decided not to scare anyone by asking them to be my friend right away - I'll save that for a couple more classes (I would do terrible as a guy trying to pick up girls). \n\nWe got two blocks, a blanket, and a body pillow. Think gentle yoga and then double the easiness factor. Being slightly nauseous and exceptionaly tired, this was exactly my speed. The class is long, an hour and fifteen minutes, but it's probably because we hold the poses for enough time to take a mini nap in between (I exaggerate, but it was very calming). \n\nPrices are what you would expect for a yoga studio. It was $15 for a drop in, $59 for five classes, or $99 unlimited for the month. Since prenatal yoga only happens twice a month and I won't always be able to make both classes (or even one class) I opted for the five class pass. \n\nThis isn't going to be my only exercise, but I'm definitely adding it to my routine!", "date": "2018-02-07 13:29:20"}, {"_key": "2230832", "_id": "reviews/2230832", "_rev": "_fNyzGZ6--C", "review_id": "4o1O8bU1PFLKqk1k_hKC1A", "user_id": "-kLVfaJytOJY2-QdQoCcNQ", "business_id": "ZuM1vcZ_ObCjCCGweYzItg", "stars": 5, "useful": 5, "funny": 3, "cool": 4, "text": "I've been going to this studio for over half a year now and it still deserves its five stars.\n\nSince I've gone here, Green Locus has changed ownership.

Day time class, she's here, nighttime class, she's here, I don't think she ever leaves. I love supporting locally owned and operated businesses and this one checks all the boxes.\n\nNow that I'm no longer pregnant, I no longer take prenatal yoga. Lucky for me, there is Mommy and Me Yoga! This studio is super family and kid friendly. They have yoga for older children as well. My class is for 18 months and younger. If you are thinking about bringing a baby to yoga, do it. Are you afraid your baby will misbehave and you'll be judged? Don't worry about that, there is no way your baby is crazier than mine. In the past eight classes we have taken, I've done maybe a total of an hour of yoga combined. All those other babies laying on the ground? None of those are my baby, mine is being held in the air Simba style, and that's ok. The great thing is this is more about the community than the yoga. I've made great friends in this class and I bet anyone who visits will too.\n\nBut let's say you aren't pregnant or a mom, they have tons of other classes. I had some classes leftover from the pack I bought for prenatal so I used it for Yoga for the back. The class was awesome and the people are super friendly. Again, I felt like I was part of a community. \n\nYoga not your thing? They also have barre and ballet classes. Barre is the one fitness class that I hated in the past, I shook the whole time, but I'm willing to try it again. \n\nIf you're looking for a yoga studio, give this one a try.

They each have their own unique way of leading their classes, but each time I get a great workout (I'm talking dripping sweat and shaky, fatigued muscles) and I leave the studio with a clear and calm mind. I love the friendly, relaxed, judgement-free atmosphere and how supportive the instructors and my fellow members are. They make it fun and not so serious. I'm able to laugh and smile during the classes even though I'm dripping sweat and my muscles are burning and fatigued. I also love how the instructors take the time to correct form & let you know if you're doing exercises and poses correctly. Proper form and not injuring myself are very important to me! :) My favorite workouts are 2 classes in a row of either Barre + Yoga or Bounce Barre + Yoga.  It's the perfect combination of toning, cardio, and stretching/lengthening. I was lucky enough to take advantage of their June summer promotion for 3 months of unlimited classes. It was perfect timing as my Groupon special was coming to an end.  So I'll be sure to continue going to Green Locus often as it's my new happy and zen place.  :)\n\nI highly, highly, highly... did I say highly?... highly recommend Green Locus Yoga.

It is an incredible facility; it feels wrong to even just call it a \"gym.\" I've been enjoying it for a little over a month now, I was able to join because of a LivingSocial deal which reduced the normal monthly fee of $102 to $60 (and no initiation charge and a massage or personal training session, to boot!). This now stands as the best LivingSocial deal ever in the history of the universe and it shall never be surpassed. Fin. \n\nI find most gyms utilitarian. Some are nicer than others, some have more equipment or shorter wait times for machines or cleaner facilities, but generally the vibe is people are there to work out and you go in and get it done and go home. The atmosphere here is totally different. The whole place just seems designed to make you feel taken care of. On the first floor, there is a small cafe with very friendly staff, I like to stop there for a quick snack and some coffee after an early-morning workout. There are some armchairs in front of a flat-screen TV that's usually tuned to CNN, some longer tables where you could eat lunch, and a few smaller tables by the windows overlooking Broad Street that have a great view. I've been to other gyms that have juice bars/cafes, but this one just has a very pleasant, friendly vibe to it. \n\nThe locker rooms are great. They're never crowded, the lockers are big enough to fit whatever you've brought with you. They have absolutely every amenity you could want - for the showers, there are shower caps, razors, body wash, shampoo/conditioner, and shaving cream. The towels are fluffy and always plentiful. There are individual vanities stocked with deodorant, hairspray, body lotion, hairdryers (with diffusers!) and curling irons. Whatever you need, they have it here. I don't think I've showered at home since becoming a member. \n\nSince it's been approximately 1 million degrees throughout my membership, I've been using the pool rather than the other fitness facilities. It is absolutely lovely. It is occasionally crowded enough that I've had to share a lane, but everyone is very friendly about it. Only once have I ever had to actually wait for a lane, and that was literally for five minutes. After my swims, I like to indulge in a soak in the giant hot tub, which is the size of my living room at home. I am not kidding. There is also a sauna. The hot tubs and saunas are single-sex, while the pool is co-ed. I'm a fan of the setup. \n\nAs others have mentioned, if the Sporting Club has an achilles heel, it is the price. I believe the normal initiation fee is $450, on top of the $102 monthly membership fee. They were recently running a promotion for a $99 initiation fee, but you're still looking at a considerable amount of outlay for a gym membership. If you can find a way to fit it into your budget, it would absolutely be worth it.

The clientele vary and you will find a lot of self-important showy people walking around but luckily the size allows you not to have to have direct interaction with most of them.

I subsisted for days on spin classes and tuna wraps from the juice bar.

The main floor is open and airy - you'll never feel like a hamster on a wheel.  Anything and everything you could possibly want is here - yoga, zumba, boxing, spinning, indoor track (suspended above the gym floor - so cool), basketball court, swimming, the jacob's ladder machine from the Biggest Loser, sauna/steam room/hot tub, unlimited towels...I could go on forever.  AND, word on the street is that they're building a roof deck for spring; I could plotz from happiness!  Also, don't forget about the FABULOUS hours (open until 11 pm M-Thu, 10 pm Fri, and 8 pm Sat & Sun).\n\nThe Sporting Club is pricier than your average gym in Philadelphia, but you'll never feel better about spending your money.

Clean locker rooms, steam room, dry sauna and jacuzzi are wonderful amenities.

But beyond the prime location and the size of the place, it really is not in any way a nice or fancy gym.  The machines are old, the towels cheap, the TV systems crappy, the locker rooms are dank and crowded and the staff unhelpful and unremarkable.\n\nI have heard great things about their classes, but I didn't take any so can't speak with authority on them.  But on the basis of the gym alone; the owners clearly have demonstrated no commitment to investing in top of the line new equipment which should be the hallmark of any top rate establishment.  The treadmills appear to be at the very least 10 years old with ancient red dot LED displays, the stair masters are fine but also old and faded; there are three newer ellipticals and the rest are all old with cracked rubber handles and over-worn steps.  The basketball court is very, very nice and there appear to be regular pickup games (although the balls on the ball rack were mostly deflated, which to me is another sign of lack of attention by the staff).  \n\nYou can tell a lot about a gym by their towels.  What you get here is a thin, rough, scratchy piece of cloth that reminds me exactly of what we got to use after P.E. class in high school.  It's a small and insignificant thing in one sense (no one chooses a gym because of a towel), but to me its indicative of a larger problem in that the Sporting Club has chosen the cheapest and easiest option in a lot of areas.  They wash all their towels onsite and to upgrade to something nicer would be a relatively insignificant cost based on their size...but they chose not too as like with the old machines and the faded carpet of the \"fitness floor\" they adhere to an ethos of getting away with spending as little as possible.\n\nMy feeling is that the Sporting Club at the Bellevue has an excellent revenue stream and whoever sits on the top of that food chain has chosen to take their member's money happily and spend it on themselves rather than reinvest in the gym.  I can see how it might have been a great place at one point in time, but now its just another gym with a nice name and a good address.\n\nI spent a total of $126 dollars for a 15 day, short term membership there ($75 sign-up fee and prorated monthly fee for my 15 days).  When I signed up I specifically stated that I would like to work out until Saturday, February 4th.  I showed up on the 4th for what I expected to be my last workout. I took the elevator to the 8th floor, walked over to the desk, scanned my card and an alert popped up saying my membership was \"cancelled\".  The friendly lady at the front desk called the manager who checked into my info and said, that my short term membership had indeed expired.  Perhaps I'd counted the days wrong when I signed up (I could have and would have gladly paid for an extra day), perhaps the membership guy counted them wrong; the bottom line was that my card wasn't working and the manager had no interest in helping me out.  You'd expect any normal business to perhaps bend the rules to make a customer happy and let me in for free, or at the very least let me pay something to get in.  But no, he said unless I had a friend in the gym at that very time who could vouch for me and pay $20 for me to come in, then I wasn't welcomed.  And so I traipsed back out; somewhat incredulous but ultimately unsurprised.  The manager's effort mirrored the gym itself: just doing enough to get by but in no way trying to achieve anything above and beyond.", "date": "2012-02-07 21:44:16"}, {"_key": "2058751", "_id": "reviews/2058751", "_rev": "_fNyzAIS--J", "review_id": "p2CFifo6PPHRDSyKwtb1zw", "user_id": "qAQjfwspeg9WvCewHLrxOQ", "business_id": "dKfMKFaiHC_9XLHdqhFN2w", "stars": 4, "useful": 5, "funny": 3, "cool": 2, "text": "When I lived in Philadelphia, I was a member of this gym.

Unfortunately, because my employer did not participate in the direct discount program, I was denied a discount even though it was available to other employees in my building whose status was full time instead of contracted.  I wish Sporting Club had made an exception for me, since the only reason I enrolled in the first place was because of my client's advertising to all employees on the site in which I was being paid. Since they wouldn't honor it, I found Sporting Club to be generally unaccommodating and I didn't stay with them after switching jobs, to a place that was willing to offer a better deal through such payroll deductions from my new employer.

I love to run and the indoor track is a boon on those freezing winter days when jogging outside just isn't an option. \n\nWhat I enjoy most about the Sporting Club is the variety of classes and instructors offered, with plenty of class times to suit your schedule. Most of the group classes are around the lunch hour or early evening which makes it very convenient to do a little yoga on your lunch break, or spin out some stress after a long day in the office.

The basketball court, pool, and racquetball/squash courts are fun for a break from typical workouts. \n\nThe monthly fee might be expensive by Philadelphia's standards, but all things considered, it's really not.

I happily jogged on a treadmill with a built-in TV and cranked out a HIIT set on the mats lined up along one wall. That space was a bit narrow, but it worked. I noticed the fitness floor was pretty male-dominated, with lots of guys who looked like professional athletes. A bit intimidating, perhaps, but everyone was just doing their own thing. There was a machine for every imaginable muscle group plus a large area with free weights. You could also watch a dodgeball game in progress on the basketball court below, and I passed a number of fitness studios with well-attended classes in full swing. An indoor track is suspended above the fitness floor for those who prefer to move from point A to point B. I like the pace-setting capacity of a treadmill so I passed on that.\n\nPost workout, the shower facility is fully stocked with bath products, razors, and shower caps. Plenty of towels available, and there were vanity stations equipped with blowdryer, flat iron, and curling iron, plus lotion and hairspray! That was a pretty awesome touch.

At first I was obsessed. But lately it has been so crowded it's hard to deal with. I used to love working out in the mornings getting ready at the gym then going to work. That's the reason I joined such an expensive gym, was to have a nice locker room. However, if I do that there's no where to get ready. I wait to find a spot to put on makeup and try to blow dry my hair. It's way too crowded for only about 10 stations to get ready at. Also the classes are super crowded. If you don't book it right away you can't get into any of the good ones. It's been so frustrating. \n\nAnd on top of it they change their perks without explaining. When I joined a perk was free PSN sports teams. It's one of the reasons I was ok with the price. I join and email about how it works and I'm told \"they no longer do that\" without any explanation. I emailed back to ask why and when this occurred because it's one of the reasons I joined and no one has responded to me ever. It's been over a month. \n\nIt's the best of what's around but I don't think it's worth the cost. To top off all of my issues I just received a letter they're raising the monthly fee. It's only by a few dollars but it's the principal. So frustrated but unfortunately in philly there's no where else to go. So that's why it's so popular.

Love! \n\nThe owner, Michelle, was incredibly sweet as she helped me set up my bike (I hadn't cycled in over 6 years - yikes!) and get me all situated. \n\nThe class was super intense (in a good way!) and halfway through class, they came in and offered everyone bottles of water - as if they couldn't get any more awesome!!! \n\nAfter class, we stayed around chatting with Michelle and she so sweetly and patiently answered all of our many questions. \n\nI loved the vibe, the energy, the equipment, the people - EVERYTHING - about Soho Cycle Studio and I will most certainly be spinning there again very soon.

You can buy your classes and reserve them online. It's usually pretty high energy. I love the fact that they give you towels, you can buy water, if you are new to spin you have the option to wear sneakers instead of spin shoes, and they have two bathrooms where you can freshen up after class or change. They also have projector screens with the music videos on the wall, which is cool. The quality of the class is solely dependent on the instructor. Take the time to find the right instructor for you. Some of them are really great. \n\nI have a feeling that the owner will pick instructors that pack a full class, but it doesn't mean the instructor is good. Sometimes you have a new instructor that isn't social media savvy or doesn't work at Lululemon for example, and it will obviously take her longer to fill the class and build a reputation. Those instructors do not get the great class times either, and it makes it a lot harder for them to build their class. The problem is the instructors don't really have that long to prove themselves in terms of their marketing ability. \n\nToday, I had a class that was almost full in terms of people who booked the class. The instructor was on her phone texting or e-mailing and figuring out her play list literally the whole class, and it felt like more of a giant advertisement or promotional gig than a class. She kept calling out people in the area that have \"fitness\" businesses or work in the business in the area she kept talking about her future classes, and her eyes were glued to her phone. She also kept changing the song in the middle of the song several times because she didn't have a playlist set up in advance. If someone was not in the business, she would call them out in a rude way for leaving early. It was an hour long class right before most people go to work, so it's likely that some people are going to leave early to get to work in time.  If she knew them, she would say bye with a smile on her face. It was so strange. She also went over on the class, and she didn't have anyone stretch. I personally lose motivation when that happens.

He adjusted my bike and helped me get clipped in.\nI sat there a moment and my daughter told me to start pedaling. I told her I thought it best to conserve my energy, but she insisted that I had to warm up. After a few moments, the class began, and I was transported to a completely different world.

Firstly, they separated our bikes after they told us we'd be riding together. That didn't start our experience well at all. Then we went to the extremely small locker area with one flimsy bench for everyone cycling (i.e., dozens of people) to use. It was so cramped and obviously didn't smell pleasant with so many bodies crushed together changing shoes.\n\nThe classroom is large, but there are one or two load-bearing poles that make some bikes less desirable than others. The floor is so slippery with the cycling shoes on. I almost witnessed a pregnant woman slip and fall face-first. Thankfully, she caught herself on another bike. \n\nThere were technical issues throughout the class, with music not playing for various reasons. The instructor had to go to the back several times, which killed the energy every time.\n\nWe had been to CycleBar a lot before trying Soho, so we naturally compared everything (as is the nature of Yelp) and concluded that Soho didn't have any positives over CycleBar, which has a large locker area with multiple restrooms, carpet throughout the studio to negate slipping, stadium seating in the studio (so you're not staring at someone's butt crack the whole time), snacks, cold and tepid water dispensers, zero technical malfunctions in the many times we've gone, much more parking, and the list goes on.\n\nAfter the Soho class ended, we headed to the locker area and discovered children playing with tablets and toys on the one available bench. Again, we maneuvered through dozens of people to get our stuff together and return our shoes. Just not a comfortable experience. A staff member asked us how class went. When I said it had been \"okay,\" he didn't inquire further, which indicated to me that nobody there really cares to improve the customer experience.\n\nI'm giving two stars instead of one, because the instructor and workout were fine.

We never have any issues, as we pay 5 dollars and our toddler jumps for about 30 minutes and we are done.  Since this is one of his favorite spots, we figured why not have his 2 year B day party there.  From the initial contact we made with the staff, it was extremely relaxed to get a party room.  We were told to give the date and set the time and that was it!  We were told we had to put down a deposit, but when we wanted to pay we were told that there weren't any other parties that day, so no deposit was needed.  We asked how much it would be for our other guests to jump and were told we pay $225 and it includes 20 jumpers.  Great we thought.  We never heard anything back...no communication after booking on the 21st of December for the 15th of January.  We ended up having to call them two days before the party for our pizza order in (they never reached out to us and they acted VERY non chalant throughout the whole experience).  So finally we made it to the party day.  Management was very helpful during set up, but once the party started, our 35 guests were left to a poor 16 year old girl who, in my opinion, was not experienced enough and obviously needed help.  From the get go, everything moved at a snails pace...from serving the pizza and getting the drinks, to rudely asking my wife why she was handing out stickers (really?  You put them on the cart!)  Mind you, the party room was VERY VERY stuffy (is there any AC in there?)...and it didn't help that drink orders were an afterthought due to the young girl having to manage a party with no management help or other staff helping.  To make matters worse, the girl that was working our party was hanging out at the front counter eating chips and talking to coworkers just chillaxing.  We had a $200 cake, party favors, pinterest level decorations and it was all a let down because of Jump Street's lack of communication and professionalism.  In the end, the manager Elliot was told of the situation and was very professional in allowing me to explain my displeasure and he ended up offering a discount (which honestly didn't matter because the party was a letdown, no offense).  The only reason I am giving 3 stars is because the manager (Elliot) handled the situation well.

I really hope the app and website get fixed, because I do want to continue with the classes. \n\nI took mostly cycling classes, 1 Pound class, and 1 boxing class. I wanted to try as many classes as possible in case I decided I want to attend regularly. Let me start with the classes that kicked my butt--Pound and Boxing. Pound killed me, but it was also the second class I went to, so I was pretty out of shape still. Boxing was awesome, but I took it towards the end of my pass since Pound had been such torture for me. Shandise was really helpful with the newbies who had never done boxing before (like me, ha!).\n\nAs for the cycling I took classes from Christin P., Colie M., Bailey P. (Owner), and Luke L.

The projection was large enough for all in the class to see. It was an engaging distraction from the ass kicking that Colie was handing me. In other spin classes that I have attended, I would typically find myself reflecting on the time hoping the hell I was going through would end soon.

Bailey rocks the Wednesday night workouts and she does a mix of weights, bands, and boxing.  I can see shoulder and arm definition I didn't have prior to this class!    Karen has the Saturday morning classes and she kills it with tobatas and boxing.  I can't say that I prefer one of the other, they are both a different style and they both make me want to die at least twice per class.  \nAnother thing to mention - the black lights and music work well to put you in a zone.

Once you enter the member's door there are lockers where you can store your things.  There's a medium-sized room for classes.  To be honest it seemed a little small for a facility this large, but it was nice to see that they had at least eight spinning cycles that could be put into the room for spinning classes.  There was literally a wall of treadmills available.  I counted at least ten of them.  There was another wall of cycling machines with digital displays.  There were three smith machines and two power racks.  All of the equipment appeared to be StarTrac.

A after the tour, I explained I needed to wait till Monday to get a discount voucher from work, no problem.  After some casual talk, on my way out I asked if I could get a pass till I was able to bring in the voucher, he quickly dismissed the idea by asking me to bring in the voucher.  I have a friend who also goes to LA Fitness, I told him I was going to join, and he goes to the Golf-links location, too far for me.  That same night I get a call from the Golf-links Club, nice guy named Andrew, he offered me a pass, and said that a friend had requested it for me, I later learned it was indeed my friend.  I decided to go and join at the Golf-links Location, since they were so nice, and the front desk people very professional, its called reciprocating.  after coming back to my location, Oro Valley, I was approached by a very nice trainer Mike, who offered an hour free training, this turned out to be on the day I went to Golf-links to sign up so I called at 5:30 AM to cancel with Mike, off offcourse when I went in today Mike had not gotten the message , we rescheduled and was told that that's the norm with the front desk.  That same morning I approached the front desk to ask about a promotional package that they had promised to give me, a towel , lanyard and a T-shirt, well they never took care of that either.  I came out after my workout and inquired about both my message to cancel from the day before and my stuff.  The young lady in charge at the front was very busy with personal chit-chat, smiling and conversing , from what I could here it was not business related.  After getting her attention, I asked about these things, she acted bothered and not very helpful, she said that that was someone else I had to speak with and they were not at their station, I had to ask if they were going to be in any time soon, she said I think about 11:00, she should have told me that from the start.  I then told her about Mike, and why he was not given the message on cancellation, she basically said , well I didn't take message, not very good people skills.  I asked if I could speak to Mike, since he had offered to give me his phone, she said I think he left.

The down side is the California based management team chose to keep many of the crappy Star Trac exercise machines rather than trade them out for better Life Fitness/Hammer equipment. They did get rid of the crappy Star Trac elliptical cardio machines but replaced them with a low end Matrix ellipticals rather than purchasing a better model of the Matrix elliptical that includes adjustable incline as well as adjustable resistance.  \n\nI generally choose this club for morning cardio and light workouts with a friend, but use the original Tucson LA on Ina Road for more intense resistance workouts because it has smartly retained much of its \"old school\" and  more effective Life Fitness  and Hammer equipment. \n\nIn general LA Fitness locations provide a decent workout experience for the average fitness enthusiast. A more hard core, power lifting or CrossFit athletes are better off at gyms in Tucson that cater to their sports. \n\nMy on going complaint with LA Fitness is the company's policy regarding disposable employees.

Thus, this review is based solely on our experience here, where we did not even get to rock climb.\n\nSo hands down worst rock climbing experience that we have ever had. While we are definitely not experts, we have been rock climbing quite a few times (we go about a couple times a year), and typically visit Go Vertical in the city, Elite Climbing in NJ and also a place in Doylestown and have never experienced any issues. We were always able to do a quick review/refresher and start climbing and belaying within 10 minutes of arrival. Well here apparently you have to be triple certified to rock climb Mount Everest in order to not take their instruction class. BTW there is a Groupon online for this.\n\nTo start we came here on a Saturday, and the place is packed with kids for multiple bday parties. There are a couple high walls, but definitely the smallest overall gym compared to other places. However, there is a very large bouldering area, which is nice. It took quite a long time to check in, they have two computers to sign the waivers, and note that the majority of the number keys do not work, so you are basically entering dummy information just in order to move on to the next step (so since most people have a 215/267/610 phone number in the area that would lead to the conclusion that all of their waivers have wrong information). Then we had to tell the girl at the counter literally 3x to only put two of the three people on one credit card, and she still seemed confused. Best part is that when we were trying to get a refund (it is about $50 for two people, harness and shoe rental) they asked for my receipt (which I threw out) because they could not find me in the system...because the girl charged my card under another guest...So i literally had to log in to my credit card account on my phone to prove that we paid. However, that was still not the main issue of the day...\n\nSince we have been climbing before we said we did not want to do the two Instruction classes required to do bouldering and belaying (which starts every hour in a group and is about 30 minutes and 45 minutes respectively). So they said we would need to pass a test in order to climb. Sure? They gave us harnesses (which were a brand which we have never used or seen before) to put on. After getting them on, one of the girls comes over looks at us and tells us our harnesses are on incorrectly and we have one more chance to go over our setup and correct any mistakes. They refused to tell us what was wrong with our initial setup. We looked over each others gear and my husband had a twisted strap which he corrected and we didn't notice anything wrong with mine. My brother in law was there as well and also didn't see anything else wrong with our setups. So after review the original girl we bought our day passes from comes over and says we have failed, and we need to take the Instruction class. Again....we were not about to scale Mount Everest, but were about to climb a wall in a controlled environment. And again, I totally agree that everyone should do things correctly, however, there is 0 reason to go through a 30 and 45 minute Instruction class when it would literally take 2 minutes to tell us what was wrong with the harness and also to quickly review the basics of spotting and belaying per all the other gyms we've been to.

I used to belong to Vertical Extremes in Downingtown, but switched to Oaks mainly b/c it's much closer to work and home.  I've been to most of the rock gyms in the area (PRG Valley, Vertical Extremes, Doylestown, North Summit in Windgap), and PRG Oaks is smaller than most and also quite popular, which makes it more crowded.  Nonetheless, it's a fine place to climb, and clearly I wouldn't have joined if I didn't like it there.\n\nYou can get stats on number of routes, height, etc. from their site (I don't want to misquote), but the top rope area does feel smaller than most gyms (also a lead-only wall).  The bouldering wall is pretty substantial, mostly overhung to varying degrees, plus a slab bouldering wall.  There's a good variety of top rope routes, and routes along the fake crack are some of my favs.  However, they do seem to lack a certain creativity in setting routes.  I like when a route requires creative technical moves or interesting body positions.  Most of the routes here are more straight up hand-foot-repeat, and difficulty is achieved by tougher and fewer holds, rather than technical maneuvering.  Not to say they're not fun and different - but uniqueness and interestingness could be increased.\n\nThe staff has always been friendly, as has everyone I've talked to in general.  Patrons range from life long climbers, to first timers, to kids' groups.  I'm constantly getting schooled by tweens and old men (but so it goes in climbing).  As I mentioned it gets crowded on week nights, but the large groups tend to clear out by 8pm or so, and the last hour 9-10 is usually pretty empty.  They also have women's climb on Tuesdays and Saturday mornings which I've never gone to but it's a cool idea - any female can come and climb with other women to swap belays, tips, beta, etc.\n\nI disagree with some of the points from another yelper.  I don't find the gym dirty (sure it's chalky and I wouldn't eat off the floor, but it's a gym).  And I don't feel like it's a meat market.  Sure there are some muscle boy boulderings trying to show each other up, but the crowd is diverse and includes plenty of women.\n\nSo a solid 3.5 stars.

It's a great price for what it offers.  Hours are great, 4am -11pm during the week. We also wanted a gym that had plenty of equipment that was in good condition. This place has it. Plenty of cardio machines that have Bluetooth capabilities as well as USB ports for charging. I tend to watch my own shows on my phone rather than the TV that comes with the machine, so I can't speak on the frustrations of some other complaints in this area. I did like the life fitness app that syncs, so I can start managing my workouts. That was cool. The gym is large, and there are multiple cable machines available. This was a huge plus for my husband and I, as we love our cable workouts and hate having to wait in lines and to constantly have to educate people on common gym courtesies with workout equipment. There are plenty of benches in the free weights section and plenty of Olympic sized bells and racks for multiple lifters at a time. They also have many of the newer items that are perks for us. Battle Ropes, large tires for flipping, etc. so you can definitely keep your workout interesting. I don't mind the locker rooms being small. It's not a fitness \"club\" it's a gym. You can get in, do your thang, and get out. I love their eco friendly faucets in the bathroom too, btw.  They have all three water, soap, and dryer on the same unit over the sink. They do have a a spin room, which we will be trying next. No mirrors in it though, which I don't mind for the next few months while I shed these pounds, but eventually I may wanna check myself and my progress out! They also have Pilates and yoga classes that I have heard good things about too. Will report on those when I try them out. Three things that I will say that I would highly suggest: turn down the lights for god sake. It's ridiculous. Secondly, they need bike racks outside, and lastly, where are the gym towels? I will say that the current staff isn't very knowledgeable about anything other than signing up, so if you are looking for some hand holding, this is not your gym. But those of you looking for a place to knock out a solid workout and you already know your stuff, this is your place. Hopefully they will have more engaging, proactive staff soon, once the initial hiring staff passes through.

No filtered water to refill your water bottles ( which my planet fitness had) The music was super low. the TVs were old and some were not working at all.  The locker room sinks definitely need replacing, they look dirty even though they are clean.  Everything in general just needs replacing... Old and dated. Overall  still a good place to work out... I'll go there for now bc it is close to my house. But I was told this location is getting an over haul in The summer ( of 2016)! So I'm super excited for that. I'm a black card member (20 bucks a month) for over a year now! And I've been more then thrilled with the facilities in Virginia.

That is really affordable! They make it impossible for anyone to use affordability as an excuse for not working out!\n\nI'll break it down for you:\n\nPros/Amenities\n+All of the machines (mostly updated & new) you'd find at most any other gym or health club.\n+Weight training.\n+\"20 Minute Express\" circuit.\n+Ample amount of machines.\n+Televisions.\n+CLEAN showers/bathrooms (being a clean freak, I am very impressed by the high standards of cleanliness at this gym.)\n+Tanning (I don't do it, but it is an option at a higher membership rate, I think you need the black card membership for $10 more a month.)\n+Wiping down the machines is required.\n+Good music in the background (at least it isn't techno)\n+Helpful staff\n+Everyone is there to work out and get healthy. There is a range of people there from beginners to gym rats and there are people of all sizes and ages. Unlike at some of the other gyms where I've tried out a membership and everyone seems to be a body builder or a professional athlete and they are snobby about it. \n\nCons/ Areas needing improvement:\n-No classes. This is the part I really regret. I wish they offered group fitness classes. I think they have personal trainers but I'm not sure that is included with the basic $10 a month membership. There is a free beginner's course that teaches gym novices how to use the machines.\n-No juice bar. They do offer water/sports drinks for a nominal charge. I don't care about juice bars at a gym, but some people may.\n-No swimming pool. Again, not something I really mind but some others may consider it a deal breaker.\n-No sauna. A sauna would be nice.\n\nIf you are looking to get in shape for a reasonable price, look no further. There is also a location in the Citrus Park area. I don't think the cons outweigh the pros considering that all I do at the gym is the eliptical and treadmill and some light strength training. It is good to get out of the heat and I like to shower when I'm done in their clean clean showers! I think it is a bargain considering that LIfestyles charges like $40-$50 a month. Also, I don't think they charge you a registration fee but this may have changed. I do know they charge a once a year $19 fee in October. \n\nLike I mentioned, there are two main membership choices--basic, $10 a month or a \"black card\" membership that gains access to the tanning beds as well as lets you visit other locations besides your home location for $19.99 a month. \n\nDefinitely no meat heads or women looking to pick up meat heads here. It is a relaxing, non-intimidating atmosphere, so anyone looking to get fit for the first time in life need not worry about that sort of thing.

The desk people said they have asked many times for another ab machine and yes, there is one that people hardly use because this one machine is better and more efficient. Come on, have some of the staff wander around and correct some of these problems. Other gyms we've belonged at had rules of etiquette clearly posted and enforced....no cellphones, wipe down equipment, put weights back when done, allow other members to work in on the machine if you are doing multiple sets, and so on. It created a stress free environment and workouts were done in a timely manner. \nIn response to Customer S.....my husband did mention the issues at the desk, as I stated in my review, he was told they have no control over how long someone stays on the equipment....this denies other customers from using the equipment they want to use....I still think this is unfair for other customers....if a client wants to use a machine for half an hour, have the decency to let someone else(who does one set) work in to make it fair.

Yeah, no shit because I moved AND cancelled before I left! \nThey're a bunch of THIEVES! \nThe manager will not cancel over the phone. The only way to cancel is to show up at the same location you've signed up at or write a letter. \nHe will also not refund me knowing I haven't even used any of the facilities in years, and his attitude was very condescending, basically too bad so sad. Well, it's not his hard earned $300 worth of charges. He will not give me the owner's contact info either, after repeated requests, who he says lives in Boca Raton, and has said the owner also denied my request for refund & request for his contact info. \nYou would think that if a person doesn't show up in almost 3 years I would get a phone call. I was a very active member and hit the gym 3-5 days a week. Everyone knew me in that gym.\nThis was also promised when I joined. \nThey told me if I didn't show up, that they will call to ask my whereabouts, to give me that push of motivation to come back and workout. Well, they didn't honor their word. \nMaybe, then I would have discovered my membership was not cancelled. To add insult to injury, when I told him this, he told me that it's not uncommon for members not to check in for 3 years at a time, and that they don't keep track of members because that gym has over 10,000 members just in the Palm Harbor location alone, which I find VERY hard to believe considering when I was a member, there would not even be 50 people in the gym. Put it this way, I'd always get a front parking spot. Good luck if they managed to accumulate 10K members after I left because, it will be very hard to get a spot on a machine. \nThe front desk is irresponsible and whoever was supposed to cancel my membership that day, did not do their job, and I've been paying for it ever since! \nIt seems I'm not the only one. \nI've googled them and they're thousands and thousands of complaints including loads with the same problem I'm having . It happens so often as a matter of fact, that it's mind blowing . This business is completely unethical! Go look for yourselves on rip off report, complaintsboard, consumer affairs, better business bureau and so on. \nContinuously milking money out of people's accounts after cancellations. Now I have to go to the bank and cancel my bank account to stop the thievery completely. \nI do not want these CROOKS to have access to my bank account information. \nDON'T give this business access to your bank accounts people. THEY STEAL FROM YOU . UNTRUSTWORTHY business. This is the only way they let you sign up to this gym. They do not accept credit cards, and now I know why!

Once I truly conquer something, it's no longer interesting to me. I was sick and tired of going to the gym and lifting the same boring kettle bell and doing the same boring bicep curls. I decided to give crossfit a try and came to Crossfit Renaissance after my sister told me how great it was. I literally can walk to about 6 crossfit studios in the city, but I get in my car 5 days a week and drive to CFR. Why? Because the coaches are awesome, the workouts are intense, and the family atmosphere here is like nothing I have experienced before. I didn't want to join a cult. I also didn't want to be shunned because I was the new kid in town. Those \"too cool for you\" vibes don't exist at CFR, and that's why I am so hooked on this place. In just 4 short weeks, I went from having a hard time swinging a 12KG kettlebell to swinging a 20KG kettlebell. I conquered my fear of box jumps (went from 12\" to the real 20\" box) and I completed an unmodified version of Fight Gone Bad. IN MY FIRST MONTH! Coming to CFR is pretty much the best part of my day. I look forward to every single workout, no matter how many burpees are thrown in the mix. My only regret is that I didn't join sooner.
