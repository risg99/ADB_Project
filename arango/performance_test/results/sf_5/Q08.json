I noticed the manager in a green sweater lingering around the entrance and then two cop cars with lights flashing pulled up and 3 officers rushed in walked to the table next to us that the manager was pointing to and one of the officer's proceeded to pull out their handcuffs and tell the guy delivering food to put food down at the table and hands behind his back.

Having recently been to New Orleans, I can tell you the decor is very similar to the trendy & chic little restaurants in the French Quarter. I cannot wait till spring to enjoy the outside dining. \n\nMy dining partner and I started off sharing, a Lump Crab Cake, Blackened Shrimp and a Cornmeal Waffle. My favorite was the Blackened Shrimp that came with a Cucumber Ranch. I tried it, it was cool and refreshing, but I ate my shrimp without it. The spicy flavor, was reminiscent of the cajun seasoning I experienced in NOLA. My DP, favored the Crab Cake. It was topped with slices of grapefruit and avocado. Make sure you get a mixture of all three in every bite. It makes for an interesting combination on your palate. \n\nOur Cornmeal Waffle was a tad cold, so we sent it back. The second one was warm and served with a large scoop of soft whipped butter. I enjoyed the texture of the cornmeal and the taste, but would have preferred some other type of topping in addition to the butter. Perhaps, a little cup of syrup. After all, it is a waffle. \n\nWe went in different directions on our entrees so we could each sample each others. Being a fan of catfish, I choose the Crab Stuffed Missouri Catfish. It was served on a bed of poblano grits and topped with a garlic dressing. You can not go wrong with crab and catfish in the same dish. \nIt's amazing how the older I get, the more I am developing an appreciation for grits. These were some of the best I have had. \n\nThe DP went with the Shrimp and Grits. The shrimp were the same as the Blackened Shrimp we enjoyed as an appetizer. She liked them. They were hard to photograph in a dimly light bar, so trust us when we say they tasted better then they photographed. \n\nBeing a bar diner, I was highly impressed with the comfort and style of the barstools. The back was low, giving good back support and they had armrest for extra comfort. Only thing lacking at the bar was hooks underneath for ladies to secure their purses and outlets to allow social media junkies to keep charged up. \n\nNathan was a great bar host and mixologist. He's a transplant from Tulsa and is adjusting to new city very well. Stop by and welcome him to STL. \n\nWill I return? - I hang out in Lafayette Square - so, YES!\n\nWhen: December 28, 2017\nWhy: It's new, hot and trendy.

The food gets 5 stars, but service brings the overall rating down to a 3. A year ago I went in with my mom and we ordered a Greek salad for two. A waitress immediately interrupted my mother and I and asked us if we were sure we wanted the bigger salad because the two of us probably could not finish it. At first I was taken aback by such a comment as it is not the waitresses/waiters job to tell me what I should and should not order. However, it never happened before so I didn't make a big deal out of it. All was well, until I went back again with my mother yesterday. Like always, we ordered a Greek salad for two. I proceeded to continue with my order and as I was stating I wanted a chicken souvlaki, the waiter didn't even let me finish before he said well if you are going to order more food maybe you shouldn't get the bigger salad. It'll be too much for you two to finish. Okay, are you kidding me? Is this a rule in this place? A rule that says you need to tell customers how much food is enough? This isn't alcohol we're talking about, you can't cut me off of food. The salad is not even big when split between two people.

I've been here a couple of times before.  Free pie Wednesday is good.  There's just a lot of restaurant choices so I don't eat here often.  We happened to be here on all you can eat chicken tenders night.  I didn't know they had that.  Anyway, my wife, son and I all got the tenders.  My wife ordered the regular, my son got chipotle and I requested the Nashville hot.  My son loved the taste of the chipotle.  My Nashville hot was okay, I just didn't like how it was soaked in sauce.  It made the breading soggy.  I should have asked for it on the side, but I didn't expect it to be like that.  I prefer Nashville hot to be more of a seasoning in the breading and not a wet sauce poured over the tenders.  I ate most of it, but some was just too soggy so I scrapped off the breading and ate the meat.  If you like very hot then O'Charley's Nashville hot really won't satisfy you.  It was spicy and had some heat but not really hot.  If you're familiar with Buffalo Wild Wings the heat level of O'Charley's \"hot\" would be in the range of BWW's Caribbean jerk.  The all you can eat tenders meal is a great deal.  With all of their specials throughout the week, and great coupons they mail, O'Charley's is a really good deal.

After finding several gifts for different people on our Santa list, we opted to return later to make our purchases and avoid the crowd. \n\nWithout giving away details, because a recipient may be reading this review. We found several unique and STL themed gifts for local sports fans and bar items for the boozers. We do not discriminate, we shop for the naughty and nice. \n\nThe staff was friendly and very helpful with our selections.

The only disappointing part of the meal were the green beans. I could tell they weren't fresh and my husband's meal came with fresh green beans. My only feedback would be to replace the green beans that come with this meal with fresh ones.\n\nMy husband had the smoked meatloaf and he loved it. It came with a mushroom gravy and he was in heaven.\n\nThe Pecan Skillet cake was highly recommended by our server and it did not disappoint. This was hands down the best dessert I have had in years.

She said \"WHAT\" I again repeated myself same question she immediately turned her back and threw my bag of food on the counter and said I can't believe he wants a discount.  That made me be not so kind in response...my wife spoke to the manager and then called the corporate office they were going to look into it.

She just in true HOODRAT format I guess called herself challenging me!

This place does a very good Florida version of that delicacy. Their scope is quite limited in that they only do tuna and salmon poke (come on, guys, try something exotic - like octopus, or  snapper, or albacore tuna), and their sauce is way too light to be authentic. But I am hoping as business grows, they will rise to the challenge. Just so you know, this business is located in what was once a drive-through coffee bar, so there is no seating. In fact, there's no parking - you drive up, place your order through the window, and they hand it  back to you from the window.

And they even do spring mix, which was great considering romaine isn't the best these days. \n\nFor our sushi selections we went with the classic dragon roll, the east roll, the j & j roll, and 4 pieces of the tasmanian salmon, which is a fattier cut of wild caught alaskan salmon. The fish absolutely melted in your mouth and highlighted the night beautifully. The dragon roll was crafted wonderfully and the rice on every selection seemed to highlight the delicate subtleties of genuinely fresh fish. The wasabi was even a notch above. I don't know what else I can say besides try it for yourself. The preparation of everything was so wonderfully thought out and you can tell they care about what they do here. Ken was also present and very humble about my compliments.\n\n6/5", "date": "2017-12-30 20:44:51"}, {"_key": "1813955", "_id": "reviews/1813955", "_rev": "_fNyy2OC--O", "review_id": "elajIlBVSZcIqRtLdbvzlg", "user_id": "6YLaFxZslnAkrppgfntDFA", "business_id": "F5suXzCkLLgHw99dhzXn8g", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Always make a visit to a Delux when I'm in town.

Below I will explain why I say that and how it came to be.  What I want everyone who reads this review to understand is a few simple strategies. 1) Know what you want before you go to a RV dealership; 2) Do your due diligence on choosing Make, Model, Options and the Fair Price you will pay; 3) Order the coach so you have time to sell your own if possible; 4) Don't be in a rush; 5) Have all your communication in writing and if something is missing, take responsibility that you did not prepare prior to your commitment.  \nAll the above is what I did.  Why, because I read every blog I can find on the subject, watch every YouTube\u2122 video I could and listen to folks who have been RVing for decades. Every single part of my requests to Tampa RV were fulfilled prior to me even setting foot in the dealership. My sales consultant, Stephen Weaver, communication with me consistently throughout the ordering process (three months).  Everyone from the General Manager to the PDI manager called me prior to delivery.  Even the dealer sent me an email after I took delivery.  \nFolks, every aspect of my sale to delivery exceeded my expectation.  Thanks to the entire staff of Tampa RV for working so closely with me.  My hopes are everyone does their research and preparation prior to even thinking about the purchase of an RV from any dealership.  Bravo to all involved.  See my addition comments below for more information.\nThis not my first purchase of an RV/Coach.  Prior to every transaction, I do a level of due diligence that most people can't or are simply not willing to do. In the past I have been asked to speak on the subject at national conventions, pod casts, YouTube\u2122 reviews including my own and my personal blog on the RV Industry.  My goal is to be a advocate for clients to have a seamless and transparent transition with most RV dealers in the United States. I am called the \"RV Advocate\".\nOn to my review. When I finally choose my brand (AirStream), model (Interstate Grand Tour) and option package (Tommy Bahama) it was time to choose my dealership.  Since I had purchased an AirStream Trailer prior, I had gone through this process before.  It seems my prior dealer did not communicate some critical facts to me on my potential new purchase, so we parted ways as friends. My money, so my choice. I knew every single Airstream dealer is a five-state radius.  I had visited most of them. I was referred to Tampa RV (A member of the RVone Group) by a trusted Airstream friend. Tampa RV's reviews were not stellar to say the least, but I studied them very closely.  It became clear to me the issues, not only with Tampa RV, all RV dealerships I dealt with was \"professional communication\" on both the client and the dealers side.  I created a process in writing to leave \"no stone un-turn\" and the result was OUTSTANDING.", "date": "2017-12-06 00:34:10"}, {"_key": "1814194", "_id": "reviews/1814194", "_rev": "_fNyy2Oq--V", "review_id": "ri9nOh50r1UNFyym48qptQ", "user_id": "57o0-FLQ91Wso-HA65OzJg", "business_id": "NYJ1PTYcQhQ8aVJiBPgIQg", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Went on a google/yelp search.

Given that this was close to where we were staying (the Marriott), it was easy to pop out and roll over to 21st Amendment, which was only a few minutes away. There wasn't a line outside, but it was packed by the time we made it inside (sometime between 10-11 PM)...standing-room only, with the seats at the high-top tables and the bar taken. The decor and ambiance is a bit more retro, but like all New Orleans spots in this fashion, it feels homey, and it was enhanced by the fact that the band in the bar playing live music was absolutely entrancing the audience, with some folks even doing some dancing right at the front.\n\nThat said, I did come here initially because it was rated highly for drinks, and on that front, the cocktails do not disappoint. The bartenders make the drinks expertly, whether you stay on-menu or stray off by giving some general preferences. The beer selection is more generic, with specific bottles being the big-label brands, and no names given for listings like 'seasonal' or 'IPA'. Nonetheless, the drinks are made quickly but consistently - something I appreciated given how busy it was that night. Pricing was reasonable, relatively speaking - $13 a cocktail is a bit expensive, but the quality was very good, making it a bargain compared to some places in New York that I have been to.\n\n21st Amendment really has a nice cozy feel to it, and with great drinks and great music, it's hard to go wrong.

It's got a lot of different areas to hang out; aside from two large seating areas on either side of the counter, there's an awesome courtyard right on the corner of Haddon and Redman Avenues and plenty of sidewalk seating out front for the warmer months. Not enough places in the suburbs have outside areas for hanging out, so these spots for people - and puppy - watching is much appreciated.\n\nTheir coffee's always been pretty good, and I think they keep switching up what beans they get. From what I can remember, I've seen Rival Brothers, Square One. They do pour overs, which I love, and they've got some more exotic things sometimes, like the Gibraltar (a variation on a cortado) and the \"Americola\", a fascinating mix of Mexican coke and a shot of espresso. To eat, there've got a variety of pastries like muffins and homemade pop tarts and quiches.\n\nAlso, it's worth noting that this is one of the only coffee places open on a late Sunday afternoon/early evening worth going.

Not only do you always provide an affordable meal that all seem to enjoy - you are consistent, every dish is made to order, and OMG can you accommodate all food preferences!\n\n\nThis visit is bitter-sweet, as I am departing the Philadelphia area for a new career opportunity.\n\nWhile I know I will be back from time-to-time, as I do have family in the area, I still can't just pop on over to one of my favorites when I need a good friend's couch to sit on. Because of all realistic measures, that is exactly what Vientiane is - a good friend's couch that you can come hang out in a laid back and chilled BYOB atmosphere.\n\n\nIt's that friend that makes you that big bowl of comfort food to help you celebrate the highs or to crush to lows... and for all of the amazing experiences I have had here - I thank you! I thank you for making eating out and being social a possibility for a gal who has multiple food allergies, is a bit of a food snob, and living on a budget. You are amazing and I will continue to spread the word that all of Philadelphia needs to come check out Vientiane, if they have not already!\n\n\nThis evening, we were seated and handed the revamp menu - which, is visually much more appealing. It is also helpful that this menu consists of GF (gluten-free) codes so I know what is and is not safe for me.\n\n\nI ordered a good classic for a table share - Lao Porridge (jow-piek) or congee. It is a smooth and comforting bowl of heaven - not too many more ways to explain it.  It is a subtle dish with simple flavors meant to heal. Good thing I planned on sharing and that I ordered the large because the entire table went nuts over it. P.S I order it with the soft tofu rather than fried - it is just a preference, but I think it makes a world of difference.\n\n\nThen, despite having a huge list of things I wanted to try (aka the casserole, Laab, any of their fried rice dishes, Banh-Xeo, a dessert, and more.....) I had to go out with the first dish I ever ordered.......\n\n\nDrum roll please..... the King Soup - or as I like to describe it as a Pho with coconut milk and much more spice! We all know I love coconut, love a creamy dish, and we LOVE spice - so win was always written all over this dish!

Note, while this dish is not marked gluten-free, I am sure that if you ask, they are able to modify it for us gluten-free folks! \n\n\nIn conclusion, it has been real Vientiane Cafe and I will certainly be back to visit!

We'd been to Hibachi before so somewhat knew what to expect but went into it with no expectations.  We sat down with two other couples and immediately knew this was going to be a weird night.  The couple next to us told us that they were regulars and came roughly once/week so we leaned on them for guidance and expertise.  I ordered the Rocky's choice and my husband got the teriyaki steak - both were good but the problem was our experience.  Immediately my water was overfilled and the woman to the other side of the table made a huge deal about it and we knew that they were going to be persnickity and make all of the servers and chefs very flustered and because of that my husband and I just tried to smile, laugh and enjoy our date night and not pay attention to them.  They went on to correct the chef multiple times during his presentation, tell the servers that they were getting them the incorrect sauces, extra dressings, multiple waters and sodas even if they weren't finished with the ones that they had (people, i tried to tell you that this was the weirdest experience we've ever had).  With how shaken the staff was, our presentation was not the best and our food wasn't cooked properly because the chef had to cater to this couples ridiculous demands (more butter, cooked more, i want my vegetables and meat mixed together, cut my meat in the opposite direction).... and then the weirdest part was that the couple ordered an additional steak which when the server went through to ensure that our orders were accurate was never brought up but then when the couple didn't receive it at the end of the meal were OUTRAGED.  To the point where the manager came over and assured them and guaranteed that he put the steak on the plate himself (he didn't) and they called his bluff and everyone got even more uncomfortable.  phew.  Now they forgot my white rice as well as the entire table's ice cream and tea and gave us the incorrect check twice.  The bathroom floors were incredibly sticky and gross and two people at our table had to request new flatware or plates because they weren't cleaned properly.

When you come inside, you'll notice, this restaurant is pretty big. You almost never need a reservation but it is good to have one for larger parties. The crowd is here everything from families to college friends to tourists.\n\nFood: The place offers Missouri raised grass fed beef. So you know you're getting good stuff. If you're not into beef, their chicken burgers are also really good. I will say though their vegetarian patties aren't as flavorful. I have been to very few burger places that can do a good veggie patty. After all, this is a burger joint. We hope you didn't come here for veggie patty. We asked for ketchup and they had a house made version. I'll say, I'm not a fan of it. It tastes like puree than ketchup. The sauces on burgers could use some inspiration. They have the basics such as siracha, mayo, mustard, bbq... But if you really want to set your burger apart, step up your game on the sauce!\n\nDrinks: They have a pretty nice bar with TVs, if you're looking for a place to eat by yourself. With that said their spiked shakes are pretty awesome. If you haven't, you should try their normal shakes and ice cream too!\n\nService: It was pretty busy when we came here, yet the service was fast. Our server cared for what we wanted and checked up on us a few times.\n\nPrice: $12-$14 for a burger with no sides is alright.

On both occasions we had the wine pairing and it was spot on perfect with the courses. We started both times with a palate teaser from the chef which promised the joys of what was to come. Unlike most multi course chef's offerings (such as Alinea in Chicago) Vetri actually gives you a choice of dishes within a limited range of beautifully prepared courses. We opted to have the chef choose for us both times so that we could taste what he thought was interesting and so that we could share each other's plates. When I say that this rivals the best restaurants that I've ever been to, it is not an exaggeration. The blend of flavors in each course and plate was magnificent.\nIn addition, we had the same wait person both times and he paid meticulous attention to us and was friendly and understated. Such a pleasure. Finally, one could actually have a lovely conversation here. It had a pleasant low level vibe without intruding on conversation.

Boy, their cook couldn't even poach eggs. The Egg was hard and solid inside, not runny at all. The ham was dark and over cooked. Too much acidity in their bearaise. Overall worst egg Benedict I ve ever had. They can't even do it better than a causal diner. My husband ordered the chicken and waffle. The chicken was in pale color and has no flavor. KFC chicken is much better than that! The waffle has the same pale color as the chicken with minimum flavor and very soggy. I think it's easy to surpass that with just your home waffle maker.

Since then I've been to Ava several times, mostly for dinner with family and friends and sometimes for lunch. I've also visited Ava to pick up food as an UberEats delivery person.  \n\nHaving visited Ava several times, I am certain about a few loves: \n\n1. The ambiance. It's perfect -- lively yet romantic; trendy yet comfortable. Ava offers al fresco dining (covered outdoor seating) as well as a variety of table styles inside (from classy high tops to traditional table seating). Be sure to ask about the \"Secret Dining Room\" if you're in need of a reservation for at least 10 guests! \n\n2. The Casarecce al Pomodoro. I love to order this dish with extra ricotta and sometimes, if I'm feeling frisky, with the Nduja sausage (this is a spicy sausage which is different from the fennel sausage). \n\n3. The Ava House Salad. It's a bit on the pricy side at $8.00, but the ingredients (mixed greens, cucumber, radish, tomato, red onion tossed in a house Italian vinaigrette) offer the perfect explosion of flavors pre-entree.\n\n4. Joe Maddon. He is part owner of Ava and he is former manager of the Tampa Bay Rays...so duh, he is a love.\n\nAlso, for solo diners, Ava is one restaurant that has an incredibly welcoming bar that erases all of the unnecessary shame in dining alone.

I'm thinking it's vibration that loosens them, and then they don't come on. And Greg confirmed that is the problem.\n\nGreg had tips on this conundrum. He asked me how tightly I tighten them. I said loosely. He said tighten them as tightly as you can. Wear a glove, in case the bulb breaks. THAT'S how tightly to screw in the bulbs.\n\nHe took out my bulbs, filed them (to get back down to the core), used a screwdriver in the socket -- yes, electricity was turned off -- to reduce debris and then blew into the sockets to get rid of the detritus.\n\nBINGO!!!!!

I must have passed by this place a hundred times and never noticed it which is ludicrous because the sign on the outside of the building is absolutely enormous and they have a unique round entryway around the front door. It sits in a small strip mall next to a consignment store and a laundromat.  \n\nInside it's rather un-inspiring with plain tables and clutter.  It is one of those sketchy looking places where you want to order \"something safe\" if ya know what I mean. We were seated very quickly and service was fast and friendly.  $41.57 got us a seafood entree, a chicken satay appetizer, and a kid's meal. \n\nI got the $7.95 chicken satay appetizer which came with four chicken skewers, a bowl of peanut sauce, and a bowl of cucumber salad.  The cucumber salad was fantastic...chock full of fresh jalapenos and onions and fresh cucumbers.  The peanut sauce was a little bland but a very generous portion.  The chicken skewers were yellow, hard, dry, flavorless, and barely room temperature.  I am certain that they were cooked either yesterday or earlier today and re-heated.  For the price, I'd expect some freshly cooked chicken.  \n\nMy son got the $9.95 kid's chicken pineapple fried rice which came with apple juice and a spring roll.  I do not like paying ten dollars for a kid's meal at any restaurant but I will say their portion was enormous.  They give 3-4 times more than any child can possibly eat.  It was the best thing I tried tonight...hot and fresh and well seasoned. I found it unusual that it was smothered with fried onions which I wouldn't think is very kid friendly.  My advice would be to cut the portion in half and lower that price and nix the onions.   Also the meal was supposed to come with a dessert which they never brought out. \n\nI watched in horror as my husband's dish arrived.  He had the $20.95 \"seafood basil delight\" which the menu said had shrimp, calamari, mussels, and scallops stir fried with basil and onions and an herbal sauce.  What arrived was a plate full of green peppers, onions, calamari, shrimp, and mussels.  The scallops were missing and the green peppers were not on the menu description.  This is not the sort of place where I would order something like this but my husband is a brave man.  He said he'd give it a \"4 out of 10\" and that it was hot but bland.  \n\nThe prices here do not match the quality of the food.  Serving old chicken is absolutely unforgivable.

This is an indication that they are pooling the tips and management gets to decide how they are distributed. It's tipping the business not the server. How much does the restaurant keep? We had the fried chicken and the batter coating was very heavy, improperly seasoned and burnt. It was pricey for a bbq place but the quality of the food and service did not justify the price. Hendricks has extremely poor service and poor food quality. My recommendation is to skip this place. There are so many restaurants in St. Charles that actually want your business but this isn't one of them.", "date": "2017-12-03 23:14:41"}, {"_key": "1834282", "_id": "reviews/1834282", "_rev": "_fNyy3LC--D", "review_id": "jMV4ufGMZqE10tzc3Olqlg", "user_id": "PN-tQedeuUYtwizmSgs9BQ", "business_id": "dChRGpit9fM_kZK5pafNyA", "stars": 2, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "We didn't really feel the love here. First off, we were greeted by an unenthusiastic waitress who was very cold and short with all of us. We started off by ordering 3 apps: the pierogies, crispy duck salad and cheese board. All of these items were delicious, however the portions of the cheese were completely underwhelming. Four people were suppose to share the cheese board. While the presentation was cute with the mouse shaped goat cheese, the portions of the individual cheeses seemed as if they were fit for a mouse! Each person basically got a crumb of cheese to taste. Moving on to the entrees, two of us ordered the scallops, one person ordered the lamb and another ordered the beef stroganoff. The scallops were good, but the best dish was the beef. We have dined all over the city and the country. The aspect about The Love that left us with the poorest taste in our mouth was the fact that this place charges $1 per person for water (still or sparkling). Mind you, it's not bottled still or sparkling, it's super filtered Philadelphia water. To top it off, there is no complimentary bread or rolls served. You must pay $5 for the Parker house rolls with chive butter, which, in my opinion, were not worthy of the price tag. Overall, the food was good, not great and we do not plan to recommend or return.

I've always had a decent experience, good margaritas and good food, the wait was never good but tolerable. \n\nWell tonight, 12/29/17, we asked for a table of 6, we were told 40 minutes wait time which was fine, we get it people probably had cabin fever and they were busy. We scurried to the bar area, congregated at the corner ordered drinks, even got a pitcher of margaritas. The bar servers were great. 70 minutes lates, we were finally seated. \n\nWe got our appetizers, they were great then we ordered our entrees. Three of us got fajitas, 2 out of 3 were cold. One of three that was hot. But the hot fajitas had such a tiny steak on it. 2 of us did not want to complain, we weren't there to get free food but eventually one of our friend did say something. Our server, Ashley, was great and she got the manager. He solved the situation by getting me a fajitas that was hotter, the way it's supposed to be. He brought out another steak for my friend. The food runner with the pink hair dropped off my hot fajitas but the literally dropped the plate of tortillas, sour cream and guacamole as if she was bothered by our complaint in front of my friend. The Diva in me wanted to snatch her hair and scold her for her behavior but in the real world I had to keep it cool. I was so angry that I lost my appetite. I don't expect to be worshipped, that's not what I wanted but a good customer service would have been great. As a frequent diner, that's all you want. Good food and hot meal with decent service. \n\nLook, I'm not here to get free crap, I literally eat out almost every single meal. I know what's it's like to deal with customer complaints, I respect everyone and do my best to fix the situation since I've had a job dealing with food and people at age 16.

I love multiple levels of their establishment, but the beer is not one of them. And let's face it, it's a brewery. Isn't that kind of important? \n\nLet's start with the heart eyes emoji provoking assets. Their food is great. Their fried chicken sandwich melts in your mouth (I didn't order this but I always get a taste of my buddies palate ). Their bao buns were not the best I've ever had, but still tasty. I actually prefer mine more on the airy, fluffy side, but they choose to sear theirs so it's a little crispy on the outside. I'd also prefer. More crisp than fatty piece of belly inside but hey look who's being contradictory now (make up ya mind, Tone). Anyways, I was surprised at how much I loved the fried rice in my salmon taco. I actually enjoyed a few forkfuls on its own throughout the course. But even still, almost all of the portions are a little small for the price. Quality is important though here, and I feel they nail it. \n\nThe atmosphere is definitely another pro. If you don't like noise, go away. People are having fun and drinking merrily. It's gonna be loud. So talk a little louder, look at your guests when they speak, and laugh at the kids next to you trying to steal their dad's wings. I'm Italian. I'm loud. I love noise. It makes me feel at home. So the tremendously open layout of this building is much preferred over their cafe location. \n\nSo the con here. Guys. Whyyy are your saisons sour? No where else do I experience this, and saisons are my favorites. And guess what.. I hate sours. Don't get me wrong, I've had a few of their beers that I have really enjoyed, but overall I think this place is over hyped. My thought is they just try to get too eccentric, and just get a little nutty with their concoctions. Like I said, I don't hate it, but I rarely love it. I'll still keep going though.

Being in the middle of the afternoon, there wasn't a long line, and getting seating inside wasn't too hard either. The vibe is pretty relaxed, with a spacious feel, some industrial finishes, and spacious booths, bar seating, and some outdoor spots as well if you want to sit down. Most of the attention was focused on the donuts, but as the name suggests, they also serve sandwiches and coffee here - so a little bit of everything for everyone. We ended up sticking with donuts, trying out the chocolate glaze, spicy maple praline, and cookies and cream.\n\nHow'd it shake out? To be honest, I was a bit underwhelmed given the hype that I had seen on here (and other places on the Internet). The donuts are very much on the thicker and denser side, and outside of the maple praline, I didn't think the frosting really stood out relative to other donuts I have had. I do have a soft spot in my heart (and belly) for maple donuts, which explains why I liked that the best flavor-wise - but it also didn't have any hint of spiciness at all, which makes me wonder why the description even bothered. The chocolate glazed donut was very average to me, and the cookies and cream was also pretty generic...there was only a small sprinkling of cookies on top.\n\nOverall, the donuts are different from what you'd pick up at a Krispy Kreme or Dunkin' Donuts, but it didn't measure up to the uniqueness (and tastiness) of other donut-centric shops that I have been to. I would like to come back and try the sandwiches, which looked tasty, but from a donut standpoint, I came away full but a bit disappointed relative to expectations.", "date": "2017-12-16 23:02:22"}, {"_key": "1839220", "_id": "reviews/1839220", "_rev": "_fNyy3aW--R", "review_id": "Tckg1y61_JnPpZS2pyzA8Q", "user_id": "rISpAMHwhmmvlFNvb-YSCA", "business_id": "ic5sXFD3-Ou4Vj49eELSRA", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Great place, caring and compassionate staff.

From date nights to family gatherings, it suits many needs. \n\nMy review is a short one. I decided that I wanted a gyro. Having had Pita Plus during my last gyro craving, I wanted something new. To begin, the inside is beautiful and classy in a revived 70's feel. That is not a slam in any way. It feels upscale and older, more mature. Everyone was very friendly and from the interactions of the other customers, I suspected many of the people eating have been there before, if not multiple.\n\nWhile I ordered ahead, I ended up waiting a few minutes before the food arrived. After traveling back to work, I dug in. The fries were seasoned well; however, they were a little mushy. As for the gyro, the meat was a little overcooked (very often, once the meat is carved, it will go on a stove top for a little extra heat) and the Tzatziki sauce was very bland with the yogurt flavor dominating everything else, which was, possibly, the greatest disappointment. \n\nUltimately, it was a very confusing experience. Spiro's always seemed like an iconic Greek restaurant in St. Louis and the feel of the restaurant fit the image I had in my head before ever visiting, but a simple dish was missed in a big way. It could have been a \"one-off\" or could have been a sign of a classic restaurant not keeping up with the times.

I have been to many, and have a definite idea of what good sushi is and what bad sushi is. This was BAD sushi. As a USF student, getting 10% off by showing my ID is very exciting. Unfortunately, I would have rather paid more elsewhere and received an edible dinner. \n\nThe first red flag was showing up at \"happy hour\" and there being only one other group inside the restaurant. The menu for happy hour sushi was also more expensive than their regular menu for the same items, which was confusing. Another red flag was that most of the rolls listed were marked with an asterisk as cooked...when there is only a handful of raw sushi options, you know your meal is going to be questionable. \n\nI started with the ginger salad, which was a laughable loose handful of iceberg lettuce, string cut carrots, and a swamping of dressing. I could have poured the leftover, watery dressing into a wine glass. I asked about their special, which I think was called \"Smokey\", because I am a fan of smoked raw salmon...the waiter cringed and recommended I try something else. I should have left after that. \n\nThe smoked salmon was listed as cooked, which also shocked me because anywhere else I go, restaurants cold-smoke their fish. It shouldn't be cooked at all, just flavored with smoke. After inquiring about the Salmon Lover's smoked roll, the waiter said that yes, it's cooked, but it has the texture of raw fish. Sounds fake, but okay...I ordered it, hoping I was misunderstanding him.\n\nThe rolls came out quickly, but the meal itself would have gone quicker had they just thrown it into the trash after making it rather than bring it to my table. The \"smoked\" salmon didn't taste smoky, and they had the texture of raw fish because it WAS raw--and beyond safe food temperatures! it didn't flake like cooked salmon and was slimy. It tasted spoiled. The tempura flakes inside the roll also had a disgusting, bitter taste that overpowered the entire roll. I didn't eat the rest of it, and hoped they'd take it off my bill. It was $12 for that monstrosity, and I was praying that I didn't get food poisoning from the few bites I risked. I told the waiter I didn't like it, and when he returned with my bill, the nasty roll remained but it appeared he had removed the cost of my $2 salad.

I have not had escargot in years, and they were so yummy. Once you get past the whole idea that you're consuming a snail, you will see it is quite delicious. The texture is similar to eating a mushroom. They were served in a garlic oil sauce and sprinkled cheese on top that was divine for dipping your bread in. The fried artichoke came with a spicy chipotle mayo drizzled over it that was so yummy. For entrees we ordered chilean sea bass, monk fish, seafood crepes, and lamb shank. Everyone loved their meals! We were also served string beans and rice. My seafood crepe was filled with crab, scallops, and shrimp. I loved it. I never tried monk fish before, and I tried some of hubbys. It was very good and had a very different texture then typical white fish does. I also learned it is known as the \"poor man's lobster\". It was very good.

Our initial plan was to go visit a few other dealers and see what else was out there, however, after sleeping on it for a night we were both in agreement that that was the best experience we have had at a dealer to date.  At home that night I shopped pricing and found that I was getting about the best deal available in the state.  I went in the next day and purchased the truck.  I worked with Derek to iron out all the details and Hector in finance to get my loan squared away.  Both were very personable, professional, and it was honestly the easiest car buying experience I have ever had.  I will be a customer here for the long haul as I really feel that buying a car can't get any better than going to Santa Barbara Toyota.

She brings us the other half of our order and says she'll come back with the plates and silverware. Brings me my drink. By this time we almost done eating. No napkins. Ended up stealing a batch from the bar. No silverware. No plates. Finally she brings plates and silverware. But she only bought 4 silverware sets/napkins and 5 plates. We have a party of 6.
