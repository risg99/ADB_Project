The restaurant is located just outside the French Market on Frenchman St, in a lower-key, musically-influenced area of town.

They use only Louisiana oysters and because of the oil spill in the Gulf, they cannot serve any dishes with oysters.  Boo.\n\nI subbed in a fish (catfish, I assume) po' boy instead and it was delectable.  It had catfish, shredded lettuce, slices of tomato, mayo, and pickles, inside a loaf of French bread.  With a side of fries, it was yummy and filling.\n\nSmall note on the fries: the menus have printed the fries are only $1.50 extra when ordered with a po' boy.  However, the restaurant charged us $2.00 and the server told us there was a sign out front that noted the change.  The menus still say $1.50 though.  The restaurant needs to correct this.

Both businesses are located in Pie Town, a neighborhood on the southern edge of downtown Nashville. There's not a whole lot of stuff in this part of town. These are definitely two of the highlights.\n\nTennessee Brew Works opened on August 18, 2013. It's popular. This place has won numerous awards and earned plenty of recognition including the best brewery in Tennessee according to Yelp. These folks are all about being local, green, and sustainable. The taproom is two stories with views of the brewery from both floors. There's a patio with both covered and uncovered spaces (mostly uncovered) as well as a small, string-lit rooftop patio. As this is a brewery, the property has an industrial, warehouse feel to it, much like the other businesses in Pie Town. It's clean and modernized. The first floor of the brewery features a small stage for live music (a band was setting up on our way out) and the room upstairs, which is much more spacious, has TVs playing sports and nice overhead views of the brewery floor below.\n\nBrewery tours take place every Saturday at 3pm, 4pm, and 5pm. It costs $10 plus tax and a fee per person. Tickets for the tour can be purchased online.\n\nAlong with high-quality craft beer, the brewery also serves food. Their limited menu includes apps/snacks like Baja fish tacos, Springer Mountain chicken wings, salads, burgers, and sandwiches (including a Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich). Food prices range from $8 to $18 per plate.\n\nWe grabbed a few beers and hung out inside the taproom downstairs. Downstairs, they use barrels (some with tabletops) for tables with bar stools. We showed up around 2pm on a Saturday and the place was busy. It wasn't slammed or jam-packed, but most of the tables upstairs and downstairs were taken. Our group of six was lucky to find a table in a corner next to some brewery windows. The atmosphere was very relaxed and laid back. The staff was cool and friendly. We all enjoyed our time here.\n\nI don't think Tennessee Brew Works has dedicated parking. We parked for free on the street (Middleton Street because we also went to Third Man Records).

It's managed by the city's Parks & Rec department. This is a great sightseeing spot in Philly. I recommend it. The views are beautiful.\n\nSome quick Q&A:\n\n1. Why is it called Logan Circle?\n\nBecause it serves as a major traffic circle for Benjamin Franklin Parkway (https://www.yelp.com/biz/ben-franklin-parkway-philadelphia), connecting it to North 19th Street, Vine Street, and Race Street.\n\n2. Why is it called Logan Square?\n\nBecause it was one of five squares originally planned for the city in 1864 by William Penn, founder of Pennsylvania.\n\n3. Who is the circle/square named after?\n\nJames Logan, 14th mayor of Philadelphia.\n\nLogan Circle is actually surrounded by three other parks: Aviator Park, Sister Cities Park, and Shakespeare Park (small). Combined, the land area for these four parks, including the roads (Benjamin Franklin Parkway is wide and scenic) is about four city blocks. So for a city park, it's not huge, but not small neither.\n\nThe highlight of Logan Circle is a large fountain in the center called the Swann Memorial Fountain: https://www.yelp.com/biz/swann-memorial-fountain-philadelphia-2. We visited on a bright and sunny Sunday afternoon and the park was filled with people, both locals and tourists. Even though there were signs that said no swimming in the fountain, I can't tell you how many kids I saw swimming and playing in the fountain. A lot. It almost looked more like a pool or water park than a historic fountain.\n\nLogan Circle is centrally-located between Philadelphia City Hall and the Philadelphia Museum of Art (Rocky Steps: https://www.yelp.com/biz/rocky-steps-philadelphia). Benjamin Franklin Parkway connects all of it. If you've never been to Philly before and want to sight-see, I think walking the parkway between city hall and the museum is a must. Including the aforementioned adjacent parks, Logan Circle is surrounded by sights and attractions including the Franklin Institute, the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University, and the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul.\n\nNote: At the time of writing this review, there's another Yelp listing for Logan Circle. It's called Logan Square Park: https://www.yelp.com/biz/logan-square-park-philadelphia.

I purchased my old Google Pixel phone from the Google Store (online). One of the options I could add to my phone was Device Protection for $99. Device protection is the same thing as phone insurance and Assurant was the provider.\n\nThe coverage I purchased was good for two years from the date I received my phone. The maximum number of accidental damage repairs or replacements under Device Protection was two during the coverage period. My Pixel's camera lenses, both front and back, got scratched. The scratches caused light streaks in my photos and videos so I decided to file a claim and get a replacement.\n\nPer the Device Protection welcome and terms and conditions email I got from Assurant, I filed my claim at https://mydeviceprotect.com/. It was really quick and easy to do, especially since Assurant had most of my information on file from my phone's IMEI/serial number. I filed my claim on a Friday night. In less than 24 hours, someone from Assurant called to verify my information and approve my claim. I received a claim approval email after the call and a shipping notification that Monday (first business day after my claim was approved). I received my replacement Pixel on Tuesday afternoon; basically, in two business days. Fast!\n\nI did have to pay a $79 deductible, but it was totally worth it to me. It was like I got a brand new Pixel for only $178 ($99 for Device Protection + $79 deductible). Technically, the phone was refurbished, but it looked and worked like new - the battery too, which was huge, since my old battery was on its way out. Considering my particular phone model at the time, a 32-GB Pixel 1, originally retailed for $649, I thought this was a good deal. Plus, I had one more replacement remaining on my contract before my two years were up. It was nice to have that peace of mind.\n\nGoogle made it easy to transfer all of my apps and data from my old Pixel to my new Pixel. I just connected the two phones with a USB-C cable and followed the prompts. The entire transfer took about an hour (my new Pixel had to download and install almost 100 apps). I was really pleased with how simple and seamless the transition was. My old phone was essentially mirrored to my new one which was exactly what I wanted. I did have to set up new fingerprint recognition and log in to all of my apps again, but that was it. I was back up and running with a \"new\" phone with hardly any interruption.\n\nI returned my old Pixel in the same packaging that my new Pixel came in. Assurant emailed me a shipping label to print and tape to the outside of the box. I had to return my old Pixel within 14 days from the date my new Pixel was shipped. Otherwise, I could've been charged an \"unrecovered equipment fee\" of up to $2,000.\n\nIn the end, I am very happy with the Device Protection I purchased from Assurant. I already bought it again for my latest phone, the Pixel 3, for $129 (unsurprisingly, the insurance price went up).", "date": "2019-02-03 16:24:22"}, {"_key": "2258282", "_id": "reviews/2258282", "_rev": "_fNyzHbW---", "review_id": "xNTO7hUoAIx9I2uL0s8K-g", "user_id": "j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "business_id": "pCmaISSyKum22MOtPOxL-w", "stars": 3, "useful": 10, "funny": 3, "cool": 8, "text": "The Philadelphia Phillies are one of the oldest American professional sports franchises, established in 1883. Unlike other storied teams, the Fightin' Phils have never left their original city.\n\nIt took nearly 100 years, but the Phillies were able to win their first World Series championship in 1980 and then again, 28 years later, in 2008. In 1980, future Hall-of-Famer and perhaps the greatest third baseman of all time, Mike Schmidt, led Philadelphia to a 4-2 series win over the Kansas City Royals. In 2008, four-time All-Star pitcher Cole Hamels led Philly in a dominating series performance over the Tampa Bay Rays, 4-1. (Since 2020, Hamels has played for my favorite team, the Atlanta Braves.)\n\nThe Phillies play at Citizens Bank Park, located in South Philly. The ballpark opened in 2004 and is part of the South Philadelphia Sports Complex which includes the adjacent Lincoln Financial Field (home of the NFL's Philadelphia Eagles) and Wells Fargo Center (home of the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers). You can see the complex from the interstate (I-95) as you drive into the city from the airport. It's just across the Delaware River from New Jersey.\n\nThe Phillies haven't done well since 2011, the last year they made the playoffs. From 2012 to present, they've yet to finish a single season above .500 (they finished at exactly .500 twice, in 2012 and 2019), a far cry from their 2008 championship. However, the Charlie Manuel (manager) years (2005-2013), immediately preceding the current playoff drought, comprise a great era in Philadelphia's baseball history. Under Manuel, the Phillies made the playoffs five straight seasons (including that '08 World Series title), had first baseman Ryan Howard named NL Rookie of the Year in 2005 and then NL MVP the following year in 2006, shortstop Jimmy Rollins named NL MVP in 2007, and pitcher Roy Halladay named NL Cy Young Award winner in 2010. Unfortunately, the team hasn't been the same since Manuel's firing during the 2013 season.\n\nAt the time of writing this review, the Phillies have an all-time win percentage of .472 (9,853 wins against 11,032 losses).", "date": "2021-02-12 20:10:07"}, {"_key": "2310438", "_id": "reviews/2310438", "_rev": "_fNyzWcO--X", "review_id": "Ez_VZ6uSsna2r9tGKbWbKA", "user_id": "j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "business_id": "TgbI5_wXWa82NBVwkvC0yQ", "stars": 4, "useful": 5, "funny": 1, "cool": 3, "text": "We stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott Philadelphia Plymouth Meeting and really enjoyed our stay. Everyone at the hotel seemed nice, especially Kim, the lady who checked us in. Kim set the tone and was really welcoming and affable. The hotel and amenities were nice considering the tier of hotel and price paid. We were part of a wedding block and were charged $119.90 per night after taxes. Not bad.\n\nIf you're not familiar with Philadelphia, this hotel is located in the suburbs northwest of town. There's plenty of free parking and the hotel is located within walking distance of a big shopping mall, Plymouth Meeting Mall, that is anchored in part by a Whole Foods. Aside from the mall, if you don't have a car, you're going to have to Lyft/Uber to get anywhere.\n\nThis Courtyard by Marriott is four stories. Our room was 335 on the 3rd floor. It was a \"KSOF\" (king with sofa bed) room with a view of the parking lot and office building to the north. The hotel is surrounded by several office buildings so I suspect a lot of business travelers stay here to work at those buildings.\n\nFrom the outside, the hotel looks like your standard Courtyard by Marriott. Inside, it looks like some renovation work has been done. The place was clean and looked fairly modern. While there's no full-service restaurant or shop, there is a fast-casual counter where you can order made-to-order food and drinks, a small retail corner with grab-and-go items, some dining and lounge-like areas, and a business center of sorts. There's also an indoor pool, hot tub, and gym. The gym is tiny. Outside in the back is a little courtyard with nice landscaping and additional seating. It's worth exploring and checking out.\n\nWhen we checked in, Kim handed us two bottles of water and two Peanut Chews, delicious candy bars that are manufactured in Pennsylvania.\n\nOur room was clean and comfy, and contemporary in design. The toiletries, such as the shampoo, conditioner, and body wash, were Paul Mitchell Tea Tree brand. The bathroom had a standard tub and shower with a floor that was tastefully tiled. The bed was very comfortable, from the soft-yet-firm mattress to the silky-smooth and smell-good sheets. There was an artsy-looking couch (sofa bed) with a conveniently-angled end table. The office desk was extendable which was great for more surface space. The TV was a smart TV with apps like Netflix and YouTube installed. There was a coffee maker, iron and ironing board, luggage rack, and hair dryer. The Wi-Fi was free and fast enough. And there was free, self-serve, tasty coffee and fruit-flavored ice water in the lobby.\n\nStandard check-in time is 3pm and check-out is 12pm. I used the Marriott Bonvoy app to keep track of my reservation and make an early check-in (12pm) request. The hotel (Kim) was quick to respond to my chat messages in the app and she remembered me from our chat conversation when I showed up in person to check-in. I like how they stay on top of that. Saturday night, when the lobby was used for the wedding after-party, I called in a request for additional toiletries and housekeeping was reasonably quick to respond despite the craziness going on downstairs. I appreciated that.\n\nOverall, I think this is a very good mid-tier hotel.

The Flyers won back-to-back Stanley Cups in 1974 and 1975. The team's number of championships (2) is tied for 11th best in the league. Historically, the Flyers have been a perennial playoff team. All time, the team ranks in the top 10 in total playoff seasons. However, over the last decade, the Flyers have only made the playoffs on average about every other year. All things considered, Philadelphia has been home to one of the NHL's better-performing franchises.\n\nThe Flyers are among the NHL's second-oldest members. They were part of the second wave of franchises that joined during the league's 1967 expansion. That expansion saw the league size double from six teams (the Original Six) to 12 teams. Of the 1967 expansion teams, Philadelphia was the first to win the Stanley Cup. Another 1967 expansion team, the in-state rival Pittsburgh Penguins, have won the Stanley Cup five times (the most of any of the expansion teams from that year). After winning back-to-back titles in 1974 and 1975, the Flyers went on to appear in six more Stanley Cup Finals, the latest in 2010.\n\nFour of the Flyers' six retired jersey numbers belong to players who won the Stanley Cup. They include goaltender Bernie Parent, defenseman Barry Ashbee, left-winger Bill Barber, and center Bobby Clarke. Parent is a legend among goalies and a Philadelphia sports icon. Clarke was the captain of both teams that won the Stanley Cup. Parent, Barber, and Clarke were all inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. Ashbee was a member of the 1974 championship team, but his career was unfortunately cut short from an eye injury he suffered in the Flyers' series preceding the Stanley Cup Finals. Tragically, only about three years later, Ashbee passed away from leukemia at age 37.\n\nThe Flyers' home arena is the Wells Fargo Center. With a present seating capacity of 19,600 (the number can vary depending on where you look; 19,600 is from the Wells Fargo Center website), the Wells Fargo Center is the fourth-biggest arena in the NHL. The Flyers and the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers have been the building's only two full-time occupants since the building opened in 1996. The seating capacity for Sixers games is slightly larger at 21,000.

Sadly, Edmonton has only made the playoffs twice since losing to the Carolina Hurricanes in a heartbreaking Game 7 in the 2006 Stanley Cup Finals. However, their history in the 80s cannot be denied. The Oilers won the Cup five times in seven years: 1984, 1985, 1987, 1988, and 1990. To date, the Oilers are tied with the Pittsburgh Penguins for the sixth-most number of Stanley Cup championships. The Oilers and the Penguins have the most NHL titles outside of the Original Six. A finer point, the Oilers franchise did not join the NHL until 1979 while the Penguins were part of the league's 1967 expansion. It's impressive how many championships Edmonton racked up after being a member of the NHL for only about a decade.\n\n\"The Great One\" Wayne Gretzky, started his NHL career with Edmonton. He is the franchise's all-time scoring leader in both goals (583) and points (1,669). Unlike many of the great hockey players today, Gretzky was not drafted. He played in the now-defunct World Hockey Association (WHA) for Edmonton for one season before the WHA folded. After that, the Oilers joined the NHL and the rest is history. Gretzky won all four of his Stanley Cups with Edmonton. He left the team in 1988 when he was traded by the Oilers to the Los Angeles Kings. The Oilers would go on to win the following Stanley Cup without him and Gretzky would never win another Cup again.\n\nToday, Connor McDavid is the Oilers' best player. He's currently considered one of the best players in hockey. Edmonton drafted him with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft. Already, McDavid has won the Hart Memorial Trophy (NHL regular season MVP in 2017; Gretzky won the Hart Trophy nine times), the Ted Lindsay Award twice (NHL regular season most outstanding player in 2017 and 2018), and the Art Ross Trophy twice (NHL regular season most points in 2017 and 2018). He was also on the cover of EA Sports NHL 18. He's quickly climbing up in the franchise record books.\n\nThe Oilers' current home is Rogers Place, located in downtown Edmonton. Opened in 2016, Rogers Place is one of the NHL's newest arenas. It has over 1,250 TV screens and the largest HD center ice scoreboard in the league. For hockey, Rogers Place has a seating capacity of 18,347. The Edmonton Oil Kings of the Western Hockey League (WHL) have also called Rogers Place home since 2016.

It's located just one block away from Philadelphia City Hall and is adjacent to the very popular Reading Terminal Market, so it's convenient to other must-see spots in the city.\n\nBy my count, Chinatown takes up about 21 city blocks. The Pennsylvania Convention Center takes up roughly a quarter of the neighborhood. Like other Chinatowns in big American cities, Philly's Chinatown is relatively old and densely-packed. Food is a big draw, of course, with restaurants serving not only Chinese food like dim sum and Peking duck, but also Japanese ramen and yakitori, Korean fried chicken, Malaysian, Thai, and Vietnamese cuisine, and vegetarian food. There are also Asian bakeries and bubble tea galore.\n\nThe official entrance to Chinatown is located on the south side of the neighborhood on N 10th St at Arch St. The gate is known as the Friendship Gate or Friendship Arch (https://www.yelp.com/biz/chinatown-friendship-gate-philadelphia). It's a vehicular gate and, ironically, traffic flows only one-way: out of Chinatown. N 10th St is also home to the Chinese Cultural & Community Center as well as the Mandarin-language campus of the Chinese Christian Church & Center (https://www.yelp.com/biz/chinese-christian-church-and-center-philadelphia-2).\n\nI attended a wedding at the church's Vine Campus which is less than a five-minute walk away. Vine St forms Chinatown's north border with N Broad St to the west, N 7th St to the east, and Arch St to the south. The neighborhood immediately north of Chinatown, Callowhill, is referred to by many as Chinatown North. The Asian Arts Initiative, a non-profit community and arts center, is located there (https://www.yelp.com/biz/asian-arts-initiative-philadelphia).\n\nIf you want to sight-see and explore Chinatown, N 10th St at Race St is a good place to start. From there, there's a lot of stuff to see in every direction.\n\nIn addition to being close to City Hall and Reading Terminal Market, Chinatown is also only a block away from the National Constitution Center, Independence National Historical Park, and other historic spots on the east side of town.", "date": "2019-10-20 15:43:11"}, {"_key": "2499964", "_id": "reviews/2499964", "_rev": "_fNyzcR---b", "review_id": "S0K28CD-74j6CZzlq7PQmg", "user_id": "j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "business_id": "0k8DG6BPaVKCRfnWJZhLUA", "stars": 4, "useful": 7, "funny": 5, "cool": 6, "text": "I've reviewed a lot of things on Yelp, from bridges and tunnels (http://bit.ly/2YCOtxX) to gas stations (http://bit.ly/2GXPRAi), but never a gate. This is my first review of a gate.\n\nThe Chinatown Friendship Gate, also known as the Chinatown Friendship Arch and the China Gate, is the \"official\" entrance to Philadelphia's Chinatown. The gate is located on N 10th St at Arch St. It's 40 feet tall and weighs 88 tons. It's called the Friendship Gate because it symbolizes the friendship between Philly and its sister city in China, Tianjin. The gate officially \"opened\" (was dedicated) in January 1984 with a rededication in 2008.\n\nThis is a neat landmark and worth checking out if you've never been to Philly Chinatown before. It's ornate and colorful and makes for a nice photo/selfie. The architectural style comes from the Ming (1368 to 1644) and Qing (1644 to 1912) dynasties. I think Philly's Chinatown gate trumps San Francisco's Chinatown gate, Dragon Gate (http://bit.ly/2Yy21uu), in terms of size and decor, but SF's gate is actually three gates in one (two gates for pedestrians and one for vehicles). This gate is built over vehicular traffic only: two one-way car lanes and one one-way bike lane, all heading south out of Chinatown and into Center City.\n\nIf you're visiting Philly from out of town, I recommend going to Tea Do (http://bit.ly/2M9XSWV) one block north of the gate and Reading Terminal Market (http://bit.ly/2OOoUFG) two blocks east.\n\nAfter leaving a review for this gate, I realized I never left one for the SF version (http://bit.ly/2Yy21uu).

I ordered a dozen of these, but only received 10.  After letting the server know, he (eventually) brought out three additional oysters.\n\nThe charbroiled oysters were hot off the grill, very buttery, and quite tasty.  However, many of the oysters were quite small (the key to good charbroiled oysters is to use big fat oysters).  At $16.95 for one dozen, it may not have been worth it.\n\nWe also tried to order raw oysters of which they had none.  Our server tried to explain to us why they did not have raw oysters and all we could surmise from his explanation was that there were not a sufficient number of oyster boats due to the BP oil spill, but he also mentioned something about a one-hour refrigeration time, so it left us a bit confused.  Oh well.  No raw oysters = bad.\n\nDrago's serves higher-end Creole cuisine and also specializes in a variety of lobster dishes.  The restaurant is located at the ground level of the Hilton.

I love spicy food and who doesn't love fried chicken? The combination is truly mouthwatering and delicious. I'm getting hungry just writing this review.\n\nSince 2012, Hattie B's has grown into a small chain specializing in Nashville hot chicken. This location, in the Melrose neighborhood of Nashville, is the company's third and newest location in the city. It's relatively new, having opened less than a year ago (November 2017). A location recently opened in July 2018 where I live in Atlanta. At the time of writing this review, the chain's newest location opened last month in August 2018 inside The Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas.\n\nWhile Hattie B's isn't the originator of Nashville hot chicken (Prince's Hot Chicken Shack was the first and many say they do it better), Hattie B's has done a lot to popularize it in the last six-plus years.\n\nWe visited this location on a Friday shortly after the business opened at 11am. This was my first visit to a Hattie B's and I heard the restaurants often have long lines/waits. Since we arrived early, we barely had to wait. This is a fast-casual joint where you place your order and pay upfront at the counter and then wait for your food to be served to you. Fountain drinks, tea, and lemonade are self-serve.\n\nThe ample seating at this location - it's got a spacious dining room and covered patio - was the main reason we chose to come to this location over the other two in Nashville. It turned out to be the right choice. The place was mostly empty when we arrived, but was packed with a line out the door and spilling onto the sidewalk when we left shortly after 12pm. So, if you want to avoid a wait, arrive early.\n\nThe restaurant itself looks great. It looks like new construction. A functional, modern design with a somewhat vintage Southern feel. There's a fenced-in lawn outside, next to the patio, with umbrella-covered picnic tables and cornhole. TVs inside and out. It was nice and clean during our visit.\n\nHattie B's serves hot chicken plates that come with different types of chicken, two Southern sides, bread, and pickles for anywhere from $8.50 for a small dark plate (leg/thigh quarter) to $13.50 for a large white plate (two breast/wing quarters). They also serve wings, tenders, and chicken sandwiches ($9 per sammie). With the hot chicken, you can go with zero heat or choose from five heat levels, ranging in spicy intensity from \"Mild\" (\"touch of heat\") to \"Shut the Cluck Up!!!\" (\"burn notice\").\n\nDesserts include classics like banana pudding, peach cobbler, and floats ($3 each). Aside from the aforementioned non-alcoholic drinks, they serve beer (draft, canned, and bottled) too. Finally, on Sundays from 11am to 4pm, you can get chicken and waffles ($11-16 each) and bacon cheese grits.\n\nWe ordered a bunch of stuff. Here are the things I tried:\n\n* Small dark plate (leg/thigh quarter at medium heat) with pimento mac & cheese and Southern greens ($8.50)\n* Tenders plate ($9.50) - three jumbo tenders (two at medium heat, one at hot) with crinkle-cut fries and creamy coleslaw\n* Large white plate (two breasts/wing quarters) with baked beans and Southern greens ($13.50)\n* One additional tender ($2) at \"Shut the Cluck Up!!!\" spicy\n* Peach cobbler ($3)\n\nThe chicken and sides were yummy. Every piece of chicken, whether it was dark meat, white meat, or a tender was packed with flavor and spice. In terms of enjoyment level, I liked the medium and hot spice levels the best. In terms of taste, I thought the dark meat, naturally, tasted the best. The leg and thigh were tender, juicy, and extra savory. The batter on the dark meat chicken was most crispy and crunchy. Just excellent.\n\nThe tenders were my second-favorite followed by the white meat chicken (breast and wing). All chicken types came with a good portion of meat, particularly the white meat. Despite being white meat, the breast and wing still had a good bit of crunch on the outside and moistness and tenderness on the inside. It was good stuff.\n\nOne bite of the \"Shut the Cluck Up!!!\" tender and my mouth was definitely on fire, but not a sensation I haven't felt before (being a lover of spicy food). However, there comes a point where food gets so spicy that you can no longer taste the food and only feel the heat. At that point, it's not enjoyable anymore. That's what Hattie B's \"Shut the Cluck Up!!!\" is. It's legitimately very spicy, but I don't recommend it to most people unless one just wants to try it for the experience.\n\nEach order of chicken, even the lone tender, were customarily served atop a slice of white bread with two pickles toothpicked on top of the meat.\n\nAs for the sides and dessert, they were OK to great. My favorites (great) were the Southern greens (with pepper sauce), baked beans, and peach cobbler. The pimento mac & cheese was good while the creamy coleslaw was just alright (I don't really recommend the latter).

Completed in 1901, it's the largest city hall in America, covering 14.5 acres of total floor space and rising high at 548 feet (it was the tallest building in Philadelphia until 1986). The building is topped with an enormous statue of William Penn, founder of Philadelphia and Pennsylvania. This statue is its most notable and defining feature. It's situated so high, you can see it from many different places within the city.\n\nCity Hall has made appearances in numerous films including, most recently, the DC superhero movie Shazam! (2019). Something funny happens to William Penn in the movie. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0448115/\n\nThere was also a curse associated with the William Penn statue known as the Curse of Billy Penn. I first learned about it while watching the Rocky location tour documentary Rocky Jumped a Park Bench: https://youtu.be/ryGnmGKbRFo?t=757. In the documentary, host James Rolfe (more famously known as the Angry Video Game Nerd) explains that Philadelphia sports teams were cursed because there was another building in the city that was built higher than William Penn. That curse was broken when the Phillies won the 2008 World Series. Less than 10 years later, the Eagles would go on to win Super Bowl LII (2018). In college sports, Villanova won the 2016 and 2018 NCAA men's basketball championships.\n\nTwo tours are available for City Hall, the Interior Tour and the Tower Tour. The Interior Tour lasts about 1.5 to 2 hours and includes the Tower Tour. The Tower Tour, where you go to the top of the tower for amazing city views, is also available separately. Currently, an adult ticket costs $15 for the Interior Tour and $8 for the Tower Tour (less for military, seniors, and students). Visit the City Hall Visitor Center at 1 S Penn Square, Room 121 and the Independence Visitor Center's website for more info: https://www.phlvisitorcenter.com/CityHall.\n\nNo trip to City Hall is complete without visiting the two relatively new/renovated parks nearby, Dilworth Park (https://www.yelp.com/biz/dilworth-park-philadelphia-9) and Love Park (https://www.yelp.com/biz/love-park-philadelphia).

They're relatively new, having opened in 2017.\n\nAt the time of writing this review, monthly rents start at $1,714 for a 529-square-foot 1 bed/1 bath. 2/2s range from $2,460 for 1,146 square feet to $3,894 for 1,782 square feet with two balconies. Not cheap, but these are \"luxury\" apartments in a prime location with numerous amenities. Amenities include a private clubhouse, billiards/pool table, theater, conference and dining room, gym, courtyards with grills and outdoor fireplaces, bocce, and more. No concierge or swimming pool, however. The apartments have upscale, modern designs with vaulted ceilings. The apartment entrances are interior hallway entrances only.\n\nOne thing that's unique and quirky about Hanover North Broad is the apartment complex is separated into two completely separate buildings. N Broad St, which is a major 6-lane street, splits the two buildings. Our friends live in the East Building, so if they want to go to the gym, they have to cross over a busy street.\n\nWe spent most of our time hanging out and lounging around at the East Building's elevated courtyard. This courtyard was clean with manicured landscaping, bocce, cushioned seating, tables, grills, and cabanas with nice TVs. We couldn't get the fireplace working. I'm not sure what was wrong with it. I was hoping the courtyard would have a nice city view or a view of the street below, but it does not. I'm not sure why they designed it that way; probably because there's not much to look at on Carlton St.\n\nBoth buildings have parking garages that are open to the public for a fee (the ground level of the two buildings includes retail). The East Building garage was brightly lit and felt clean and safe enough.

This local restaurant chain was recommended to us by three separate friends as one of Philadelphia's best spots for breakfast and brunch (they serve lunch and dinner too). The food was good and service was great. While I don't think this place is *significantly* better than other popular and highly-regarded brunch restaurants I've tried, it's still definitely worth checking out if you want American breakfast/brunch comfort food. The food is delicious, though heavy, and the portions are huge and filling.\n\nThere are five Sabrina's locations in the Delaware Valley including three in Philly proper. This location is the second and it opened in 2007 (the first opened in 2001). Sabrina's is named after the owners' daughter. This particular location has \"and Spencer's Too\" in the name because of the owners' son, who was born later. We chose to dine at this location because it was close to our hotel, the Philadelphia 201, which is only a couple blocks away; a short walk. If you're staying at this hotel or anywhere nearby, I do recommend Sabrina's for breakfast/brunch.\n\nI heard this place gets packed with waits the norm. We showed up bright and early on a Monday morning just before opening (8am). A small crowd had already built up on the sidewalk in front of the entrance. When the doors opened, all of us were seated immediately. This place has plenty of space. It has a diner feel to it. You can sit at the counter with its cushioned and pattern-upholstered chairs or at one of the numerous small tables or booths. The atmosphere is casual and homey. There's a tiled coffee bar and lampshades with floral designs.\n\nDuring our visit, the large blackboard menu on the dining room's center wall featured chalk drawings of Sonic and Knuckles (random). Specials included chicken and waffles ($14.95) and dinner entrees like seafood scampi ($15.95) and goat cheese penne pasta ($14.95). We also received a seasonal drink menu and monthly food specials.\n\nSabrina's signature breakfast items are the huevos rancheros ($11.79), stuffed challah French toast ($11.99), and \"The Tots\" ($12.59). Other breakfast/brunch foods include eggs, frittatas, omelettes, pancakes, bagels and lox, housemade granola, avocado toast, and a quinoa bowl. Most of these other items cost about the same or less than the signature items. Most non-breakfast/brunch food includes soups and salads and burgers and sandwiches. Expect to spend about $11-13 each for those items. They have a kids menu too. Beverage-wise, they offer coffee and espresso-based drinks, teas, fresh juices, and Jones brand \"craft\" soda.\n\nWe ordered two signature items and a couple seasonal drinks:\n\n* Stuffed Challah French Toast ($11.99) with farmer's cream cheese topped with bananas and vanilla bean syrup\n* The Tots ($12.59) - fried panko-encrusted tater tots topped with grilled hot sausage hash; caramelized onions, bell peppers, and fennel seed; topped with basil chimichurri, sour cream, and over-easy eggs\n* Cookie Butter Iced Mocha ($4.79) - cookie butter, dark chocolate, espresso, and milk\n* Iced Strawberry Mocha ($4.79) - strawberry, dark chocolate, espresso, and milk\n\nThe food was great. I preferred the Stuffed Challah French Toast over The Tots, but I could change my mind given the day. The French toast was outstanding. The best thing about it to me was the filling: farmer's cream cheese. I'm a cream cheese fan in general, but this particular cream cheese was lighter and less dense than your typical American cream cheese. Its silky smooth texture trended towards whipped cream. Overall, wonderful flavor when combined with the vanilla bean syrup (I love vanilla). Ripe slices of banana and a bit of cinnamon and powdered sugar were thrown on top. The consistency of the French toast itself was soft, springy, and appetizing. I recommend this dish.\n\nThe Tots was heavy, but satisfying. It's a lot of food packed into a medium-sized bowl. The panko-encrusted tater tots were bigger than average tots. They were like tots on steroids. The ingredients, particularly the hot sausage hash and the over-easy eggs, came out temperature hot from the kitchen. I had to wait for the bowl to cool down a bit. This one was a savory, greasy smorgasbord of textures and flavors. I had the tots with ketchup and ate the rest of the dish with various hot sauces at the table (Cholula, Frank's RedHot, Sriracha). If you have a ravenous appetite, The Tots is for you; it's packed with lots of carbs and protein.\n\nThe iced mochas were good. They were expectedly sweet; almost too sweet for me (and I have a sweet tooth). I liked the Cookie Butter Iced Mocha better than the Strawberry. Both drinks were rich, flavorful, and refreshing. The dark chocolate flavor was strong. If you order these, you might ask if you can adjust the sweetness.\n\nPatricia was our server and she was attentive and sweet.

The line to get in wasn't very long, but it was very crowded inside, especially on the first floor. There were two bands, one on the first floor (ground level) as soon as you walk in and one inside on the rooftop (fourth level). I believe both bands were cover bands (definitely the band on the top floor; I remember one song they sang was the Alien Ant Farm version of Smooth Criminal). Both bands were pretty good and most people seemed to be having a good time.\n\nThere are a lot of lights and neon signs on Broadway. You can't miss Paradise Park's sign because it's one of the biggest. It's green and red and spans over two stories. It's one of the most prominent signs on the street. The space has colorful and kitschy decor (neon signs, string lights, Christmas lights, a disco ball, and more). Just inside the entrance is a photo booth and Skee-Ball. During our visit, the second and third floors were closed. The second floor was home to a dueling piano bar called The Big Bang.\n\nWe spent most of our time on the rooftop patio which was a lot more laid back and relaxed than downstairs. The rooftop has both an interior and exterior bar. The outdoor portion of the rooftop is covered in artificial turf with picnic tables, lawn/porch chairs, and high tops for seating. There was always a game of cornhole going on while we were up there. The highlight, to me, is the view from the rooftop.

I thought it was alright.\n\nVirago is part of the \"upscale\" M Street restaurant group which includes five restaurants along McGavock between 12th and 11th Aves. They are: Kayne Prime (steakhouse), Moto (Italian), Saint Anejo (Mexican), Virago, and Whiskey Kitchen (pub grub). We showed up to McGavock around 9:20pm on a Friday night without a reservation to any of these places. After first checking with Whiskey Kitchen and then Saint Anejo, we settled on Virago because they could seat us almost immediately. Whiskey Kitchen and Saint Anejo were packed with waits. There were plenty of open tables at Virago.\n\nVirago is on OpenTable. Book your reservation for free and earn dining points that can be used towards future discounts at select OpenTable restaurants or an Amazon gift card.\n\nAll three of Whiskey Kitchen, Saint Anejo, and Virago looked modern and stylish. It's evident this company has put a lot of money into the construction and design of its restaurants. Virago is the oldest of the bunch. It opened in 2000. It's been in its current spot since 2010 (the original location was in Midtown). This isn't an authentic Japanese or sushi restaurant, but more of a sleek Americanized sushi and Asian fusion joint with a huge drink menu. I'm not a huge fan of these types of places as the food can often be subpar and overpriced. Virago pretty much fell in line.\n\nThe restaurant has a swanky aesthetic. When we visited, it felt a lot like a lounge complete with lounge music and dim lighting. The place is spacious. There's a sizable wraparound sushi bar and multiple dining rooms and seating areas including a large lounge/waiting area with couches. There are private booths, big tables for groups, and a variety of lighting from pendant lights to recessed lighting. This restaurant can easily accommodate groups (we had six in ours) and the candle-lit ambiance is ideal for dates too.\n\nThe dinner menu had a decent selection of Japanese and fusiony food. They included salads and appetizers ($7-14 each) like \"V2 edamame\" (charred edamame with togarashi Japanese spice mix and sweet soy sauce) and yellowtail jalapeno (a popular app); ishiyaki - foods cooked over hot stones ($29-96 per order); agemono - deep-fried dishes ($9-19 each); robatayaki - skewers ($9-24 per order) and meat/seafood ($22-34 each) cooked over charcoal; nigiri and sashimi ($6-15 for two pieces); and makimono - rolls ($13-29 each). They also had chirashi - assorted sashimi over sushi rice ($24 for a small size, $42 for a large), omakase - a chef's tasting ($85 for the \"chef's tour\" and $95 for the \"sushi tour\"), and more. Finally, there were daily specials such as ramen ($17), Waygu strip steak ($30), and matcha sponge cake ($12).\n\nThe drink menu was extensive: cocktails, wine by the bottle or by the glass, over 40 selections of sake (impressive), and all sorts of beer and spirits (scotch, bourbon, Japanese whisky, gin, tequila, vodka, rum, etc.).\n\nHere's what I tried:\n\n* Ishiyaki Wagyu strip, 6 oz. ($35) - hot rock, togarashi salt\n* Chirashi don, large size ($42) - chef's sashimi selection on rice\n* Sake #702. Ozeki Nigori, 375 mL ($17) - crisp and vibrant, unfiltered\n\nIn general, the food was good, though not great, and everything was presented nicely.\n\nThe ishiyaki Wagyu strip was quite tasty though 6 ounces of meat wasn't much. However, what little meat there was was high quality. The meat, which had great marbling, was served raw and cut into thin slices. This was a cook-it-yourself dish. Each slice of meat was cooked, sizzling, on top of a single hot black stone. This dish was 100% meat aside from a miniscule amount of green onion (primarily used as a garnish), oil (I believe it was sesame oil, to help with cooking), two sauces (one a savory dipping sauce and the other a concentrated chili sauce, perhaps Sriracha), and togarashi salt which was more salt than togarashi. Togarashi (or shichimi) contains seven different ingredients including various pepper flakes and sesame seeds. The stone lost its heat towards the end of the meal, so the server had to bring another one. While this dish was yummy, it wasn't filling.\n\nSince I'm allergic to shrimp, I asked for the chirashi don to be prepared without shrimp. There was no shrimp on the plate, but my mouth still experienced a mild allergic reaction. There was definitely some cross-contamination going on. Aside from that, I thought the chirashi was average at best. I order chirashi often at sushi restaurants and Virago's version was simply OK. The large version was filling (at $42, it should be). It contained plenty of thick slices of ahi tuna, yellowtail, salmon, escolar, and albacore tuna plus avocado, cucumber, and multicolored fish eggs (either tobiko or masago).\n\nWe got multiple bottles of the Ozeki Nigori, a cloudy, milky-white sake.

The original sculpture is inside the Indianapolis Museum of Art.\n\nUnlike other cities, Philly's Love sculpture is propped up high so you can stand and pose for a shot underneath it (as opposed to in front or beside it). The park serves as the southern endpoint for Benjamin Franklin Parkway (https://www.yelp.com/biz/ben-franklin-parkway-philadelphia), a wide one-mile-long street worth walking if you've never been to Philly before. If you look north (technically, northwest) up the parkway, you can see Logan Square (https://www.yelp.com/biz/logan-circle-philadelphia-2) and the Philadelphia Museum of Art (https://www.yelp.com/biz/philadelphia-museum-of-art-philadelphia) with its famous Rocky Steps (https://www.yelp.com/biz/rocky-steps-philadelphia). It's a cool visual.\n\nThe park must have been renovated relatively recently because pictures I've seen of it on Yelp show a fountain which no longer exists. Instead, there's now a big splash pad. Dilworth Park (https://www.yelp.com/biz/dilworth-park-philadelphia-9), one block over, has one too. Kids were having a blast in both. Around Love Park's splash pad are several red lounge chairs. A nearby gravel space has umbrella-covered red tables with additional seating including tree-shaded benches. There's a lot of green space, but perhaps almost equally, a lot of concrete, gravel, and brick. The trees and benches in the brickyard on the southeast end of the square are nice touches. A modern-looking glass building on the northeast side serves as an entrance/exit to an underground parking garage.\n\nThis park is also known as John F Kennedy Plaza.\n\nFun fact: Love Park was designed by Philadelphia city planner Edmund Bacon, father of Kevin Bacon.", "date": "2019-09-21 07:49:27"}, {"_key": "3666592", "_id": "reviews/3666592", "_rev": "_fNy0ZxG--K", "review_id": "-RRIbHW7McNb9vgXiquVYg", "user_id": "j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "business_id": "ZsnasqY3YhRf_g2OmlTtoA", "stars": 3, "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "text": "This review is for our recent Delta Air Lines flights (two round trips) into and out of Philadelphia International Airport (PHL). In short, these trips were fine.\n\nI checked prices using kayak.com and booked using delta.com. I flew with my fiancee. For all flights, our seats were assigned at the gate. In all cases, Delta automatically seated us next to each other. We flew coach so we always got one middle seat and one window or aisle seat. On one or two flights, we got the exit row, which was nice. I remember at least one of our flights was on a McDonnell Douglas MD-90.\n\nFor one of the flights, we boarded and sat at the gate in Atlanta for about an hour. This didn't bother me since we weren't in a rush. I just watched Pet Sematary (2019) on my laptop.\n\nWe flew out of and into Atlanta. Our first round trip, arriving on a Friday and departing on a Monday, booked about three months out, cost $303.60 per person. Our second round trip, arriving on a Saturday and departing the following Sunday (quick turnaround), booked about two months out, cost $360.60 per person. Same season. Delta-estimated flight times were anywhere from 1 hour 55 minutes to 2 hours 9 minutes. In actuality, I think one or more of the flights was slightly under 1 hour 50 minutes (in pure flight time).\n\nOn a flight into Atlanta, we were one of the last ones to board, so we had to check our roller bags at the gate (free). Unlike some gate checks where you can pick up your bag at the gate at the destination (usually, on smaller jets), this particular check meant we had to pick up our bags at baggage claim in Atlanta. The Delta app was useful in helping us keep track of our checked bags, letting us know the bag tag numbers and which baggage claim carousel in Atlanta to go to. The app also notified us when our bags were available for pick-up.\n\nThe Delta app gives you a bit of information about your flight including statistics such as the percentage of time your flight is on time. One of our flights had a historical on-time rate of 97%.\n\nOur in-flight experiences were fine. No complaints. Each flight included a free drink and and a snack. The snack was a choice of a small bag of Cheez-Its, a single pack of those popular Biscoff cookies (my dad likes to buy boxes of them from Costco), a KIND bar, or almonds (I forget the brand, but it was one of those well-known brands). Not all the snacks I listed were available on every flight, but there were at least two choices on every flight.\n\nWe flew into and out of gates D12 and D14. Getting through TSA PreCheck at PHL Terminal D was super fast. https://www.yelp.com/biz/tsa-checkpoint-d-philadelphia-international-airport-philadelphia", "date": "2019-11-30 15:15:34"}, {"_key": "3678242", "_id": "reviews/3678242", "_rev": "_fNy0aGa--e", "review_id": "IamSO9DBQzX_VknoGNNiwg", "user_id": "j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "business_id": "kbEVlzQLcYS3JSQPG9QMOQ", "stars": 4, "useful": 5, "funny": 1, "cool": 4, "text": "How can you not like the Liberty Bell, a symbol of American freedom?\n\nThe Liberty Bell, which was originally cast in 1752, is located inside a building known as the Liberty Bell Center which opened in October 2003. The center is located next to Independence Hall within Independence National Historical Park, a park that consists of several blocks in Center City, Philadelphia.\n\nAdmission is free. The bell is owned by the City of Philadelphia and the center is run by the National Park Service. The center is open daily, except Christmas Day, on a first-come, first-served basis. There's not much to the place. You have to go through security (metal detectors, bag inspection) to enter. Once you enter, there's a hallway with various exhibits about the bell including a 10-minute video put together by the History Channel.\n\nOf course, the main attraction is the Liberty Bell itself which is located in a room at the end of the hallway. The bell is roped off so you can't touch it, but you can walk around it. You can view and take pictures of the bell from 360 degrees. The room the bell is located in is cool because the backdrop is Independence Hall (https://www.yelp.com/biz/independence-hall-philadelphia). Admission to Independence Hall is free too. Whoever designed this center did a great job because the backdrop is perfect; very picturesque. The bell is attended/guarded by a National Park Service ranger.\n\nWe visited the center on an ordinary Sunday around 5:40pm. There was a line to enter the building, but it moved fast. We were through security in about 5 minutes. There was a small crowd around the bell, but luckily, everyone was polite and respectful, keeping their distance and taking pictures in turn. Our entire visit at the center lasted less than 20 minutes. We could have spent more time looking at the hallway exhibits, but were hungry and wanted to get to Jim's Steaks (South Street location, about a 15-minute walk away) for a cheesesteak dinner.\n\nThe center was clean, modern, and felt safe.\n\nWe're glad we came here.

How is this a Marriott property? If folks from Marriott corporate saw the condition of this hotel during our stay, they would not be happy. This is easily the worst Marriott property I've stayed at. It certainly didn't live up to the Marriott name/standard. This hotel does have a few things going for it, but the cons definitely outweigh the pros.\n\nFYI, this used to be the Sheraton Philadelphia Downtown.\n\nWe stayed in room 1426 on the 14th floor. This hotel has 26 floors, I believe.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Excellent location. If you want to be close to all of the tourist attractions and hot spots in Philly, this hotel is central to it all.\n\n2. Good value. We paid $119 a night, a wedding block rate, which wasn't too much cheaper than the standard rate. I think this is a good price for a hotel room located downtown in a big city.\n\n3. Friendly staff. From the ladies at the front desk to our housekeeper, Gisella (not sure if I spelled her name right), everyone we interacted with was nice and polite. Even a restaurant server smiled at us as we passed by.\n\n4. Big smart TV. Not the best picture quality or responsiveness, but good enough. It had all the major channels and streaming services. You have to use your own accounts for the streaming services.\n\n5. Fast and free Internet. The Wi-Fi in our room was blazing fast. Great!\n\n6. Good, basic amenities. Luggage rack, iron and ironing board, coffee maker, hair dryer, and toiletries (bar soap, body wash, lotion, shampoo, conditioner). However, they did not offer a couple common amenities; see #4 under Cons below.\n\n7. Cool-looking, modern bathroom. There was a walk-in shower with a hand-held shower head. Both the sink and shower looked relatively new.\n\n8. Elevators were fast.\n\nCons:\n\n1. This hotel was old and it showed. We also happened to stay during the wrong time -- there were signs in the hotel that said, \"Pardon our appearance as we reimagine our guest rooms.\" So we visited before/during a renovation. Everything, it seemed, was on its last legs and the whole place, from the lobby to our room, smelled funny.\n\n2. Our room was in poor condition.\n- All of the furniture was well worn, from the surfaces of the open closet to the edges of the dresser and bathroom shelving.\n- The switch on one of three lamps in our room was broken. In order to turn the lamp on/off, we either had to unscrew the light bulb (which is what I think the previous guest(s) did since the bulb was unscrewed upon arrival) or unplug the lamp from the power outlet. We opted for the latter.\n- The bed old, creaky, and not very comfortable. It was in worse shape than my 14-year-old mattress which I just got rid of recently. Yikes.\n- One of two nightstands was super weak and wobbly. It felt like it was going to fall apart just from a gentle push. I uploaded a video if you want to see.\n- One of two phones was missing buttons.\n- The cabinet door in the bathroom was missing its knob. We couldn't even open it for the duration of our stay.\n- The bathroom faucet looked relatively new and nice, but it wasn't seated/secured properly. It was very loose. Check out my video.\n\n3. Upon check-in, our room was dirty.\n- There was an obvious stain on the carpet in one corner of our room. What could it have been? Coffee? Bodily fluids? I don't think we wanted to know. Check out my photos to see it.\n- The lamps were dusty.\n- The power sockets at our desk were very dusty.\n- The room had a decent view, but it was spoiled by the dirty windows. They were quite dirty from the outside and needed a good wash.\n- The carpet was old, dingy, and frankly, gross. We didn't step on it with our bare feet and instead wore sandals to walk around the room.\n- There were stains on both our bed skirt and comforter.\n- One of two coffee cup lids was dirty on the inside.\n- Perhaps the grossest thing were the tongs for our ice bucket. They had some nasty, brown, sticky stuff on them. It looked like dried-up syrup.\n\n4. Our room did not have the following common amenities (for a Marriott or similar property):\n- Mini fridge\n- Safe\n\n5. Our \"king\" room didn't even have a true king bed. It wasn't even a queen. The bed was smaller than a queen.\n\n6. While the shower was nice, the water pressure was low and the shower head was placed awkwardly in the corner above the retractable seat. This made showering awkward as I'd have to lean over the seat to wash my hair. The shower space wasn't fully utilized. Weird placement.\n\n7. The bathroom didn't have much surface space to put our toiletries, both inside and outside the shower.\n\n8. The AC unit was old and loud. It was one of those wall units with a control panel on the unit itself. There was another thermostat on the opposite wall, but it didn't seem to serve a purpose.\n\n9. There was no ice machine on our floor (14) so I had to go down to 12.\n\n10. Poor security. Anyone could walk into the hotel from any door at any hour it seemed.

If you're a strict traditionalist then you'll be disappointed since their spin on sushi is quite novel; combining fish, textures and flavors in ways I had never before seen.

We went on to devour the Red Dragon and Montecito rolls with impatient precision. The ahi tuna appetizer is also worth noting.

We both though the oxtail could have cooked slightly longer as it would have made the near fall off the tailbone but other then that the broth was super rich, had solid depth, and full of flavor.\n\nThe shrimp summer rolls were enjoyed by all minus Sam (shellfish allergy) and they made one of the specials GF for our table.

I was babysitting when it happened, and when I got home a few hours later, I knew something was wrong. All my roommates (there were 9) were sitting in the living room, huddled around her as she cried. At first, I thought someone had died, then, the moment she and I made eye contact, I knew this had everything to do with me. \n\nI freaked out because I had 3 final papers on the computer - they were due the following day. Thankfully, I receive an email from a distant friend who said he got a call from a cab driver who found his number in my laptop bag and wanted to get in touch with me. My friend got the cabbie's info and with that, I called.\n\nThe cabbie informed me that yes, he had my laptop, but no, he wasn't going to give it up that easily. What was I willing to pay for it? I was outraged! I headed directly to my campus police office and told them what was going to happen. \n\nI set up a sting operation. \n\nI called the cabbie back and agreed to meet up with him at The Fresh Grocer to exchange $900 for the laptop. The campus detectives geared up in their street clothes and we all walked over. My friend and I sat upstairs in the dining area overlooking Walnut Street. The cab pulled up. The driver got out of the car and hesitatingly made his way across the street towards Fresh Grocer. As he climbed the stairs to meet us, I saw the look of doubt and suspicion in his eyes. With every step I took towards him, he took another step back. Until suddenly, he was quickly backing down the stairs. The policeman (who was nonchalantly examining fruit minutes prior) raced up the stairs and tackled him to the ground. \n\nThe Fresh Grocer didn't know what had hit it. The employees were hooting and hollering. It was the best thing they'd ever seen at work. \n\nSo, disaster averted. The dishonest cabbie worked for Victory. I've sworn them off ever since. Until now, that is. \n\nMy brother left his cell phone in a cab yesterday and flew home to Miami for the summer. My mom called freaking out and asked that I meet up with the cabbie to get his phone back. Based on my previous experience, I expected another fiasco.

After selecting the Ayinger Oktoberfest brew and my friend getting the Hausbrau liter, the waitress informed us that his pick didn't come in a 1 liter serving (because the manager doesn't like to offer that beer by the liter). Without really explaining why, she walks away, but only to come back with both of our selections in a boot! Super! Except that my beer was warm...and later cost me $19.50!!!!! She explained that they didn't have a way to charge me for the boot (um, hello, why do you even have them then?) so she just charged me for 3 beers. Based on a general rule of thumb, whenever there are, let's say, 3 different sizes of things, each one costs more, yes, BUT you've got to save a little for going with the larger size. Think of it as if you were ordering a large drink over a medium one at a movie theater (\"for only a quarter more...\"). My friend's beer, $11...exactly what that boot should cost.\n\nFood: My friend ordered the Wurst plate ($16) and I went with the Rouladen ($20). The wurst came out cold. Cold! As for the Rouladen, I should've ordered the Wiener Schnitzel.\n\nThe most redeeming part of last night's dinner were the potato pancakes ($6)...not because they were amazing (they're just potato pancakes), but because they were still warm when they hit our table. \n\nOur grand total came to $78.49.

There is a nice courtyard with a fountain for outdoor seating (even though it was too cold and rainy for us to enjoy during our stay). \n\nThey served a continental breakfast every morning, and provided tea and hot coffee 24 hours a day. Very good coffee (Community Coffee) I might add. \n\nIf you are mainly going to NOLA to stay in the FQ, this is the perfect location. A couple of blocks from touristy Bourbon St., a couple of blocks from Frenchman St., and a block over from the French Market. The atmosphere and decor of the hotel kind of takes you back in time. It was very relaxing and accommodating. I would definitely stay here again when I come back!", "date": "2011-01-23 08:03:45"}, {"_key": "2086839", "_id": "reviews/2086839", "_rev": "_fNyzBHO--X", "review_id": "R0sf-LLJ_dkZV8q7TBu9Gg", "user_id": "V6PeLHJ8D1C7utl4HzjBmg", "business_id": "ompDR5sUDpoI6gnTldmneQ", "stars": 4, "useful": 1, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "text": "Greatness! \n\nThis was the best meal that I devoured during my NOLA visit! \n\nWe came across this place totally by accident. It was a rainy Sunday, and we were taking a walk down Frenchmen Street. It was lunch time, we were hungry, and The Praline Connection happened to be right in front of us! We hadn't heard of it before, but we took a chance and entered. Not only did it turn out to be a shelter from the rain, but a haven for gorging and overeating. \n\nThe wait staff was excellent, very helpful and friendly. The establishment is separated into two parts, the candy store where they sell pralines, and the restaurant. The walls were decorated with antiques and paintings, it had a good vibe. There weren't too many people inside at the time, so I was kind of wary...but that all changed once the food came out. \n\nI had the seafood platter...shrimp (great), oysters (great), catfish (great), deviled crab (great), half of my friends bread pudding (OMG sooooo awesome!). The seafood was seasoned perfectly and the bread pudding had a praline sauce on it that consisted of pralines and bourbon I think. She had The Taste of Soul platter that consisted of ribs, chicken, catfish, etc... When I think of the amount of food that we both ate that day, I almost get sick. The words gluttony and greed come to mind. So, my lesson for you, the reader, in this review, is please try to not overeat during your visit here.

I wandered inside and asked the guy at the bar if we could eat, he told us to ask the dude up front with the hat on, he told us that he would seat us. We went back up front. I had to ask him if he could seat us. He took us in the dining area. There was a large party and another couple near the cold window in the front of the dining area, the other half of the room was empty. Naturally he squeezed us in between both parties where we were literally rubbed by people getting up from their table. Eventually the big party left along with the other couple. That's when everyone else was seated on the opposite side of the room, away from the cold window, except us. I asked the waitress about the seating priorities, and she mumbled something and laughed incoherently. When we were done, I had to turn around to search for the waitress. A group of them were sitting in the back of the dining area at a table (the warm part of the room), and I had to wait patiently for her to notice me staring. She then got up and got my tab, not even asking if I wanted another beer or anything.\n\nI know that I'm bitching, I don't like people that bitch and moan all of the time either, but shit...I was on vacay, and I wanted to have a nice night out. The wait staff obviously didn't want to be there.\n\nI ordered the shrimp sandwich with a baked potato. It was decent. Not bad, but not worth the frustrating staff. This is based only on my personal experience on 1/10/11 at around 9:30pm at the small table by the window next to the pole.

As we approached Maison, the sounds of The Jackson 5 poured out of trombones and saxophones, and onto the busy street. The open doors and people dancing inside the large windows beckoned us to enter. When we went inside, we had one of the best experiences during our trip to NOLA. \n\nThat night happened to be a \"open mic\" night. A night where locals brought their own instruments, jumped up on the stage, and joined the group, ad libbing and free styling r&b, jazz, and any other genre that was requested. You could tell that these were regulars, some of the musicians on stage would call others in the crowd, asking \"Where's your trombone?\", and telling people that they need to \"Hurry up and get up on the stage!\" The jam session quickly turned into a trombone vs. trumpet battle. Both sides taking turns trying to top each other....blaring notes, clapping hands, and shouting filled my eardrums as the audience watched. \n\nThis is a part of NOLA that I always heard about, and was so happy that I got to see.

Nope. Are you guaranteed to find a wide variety of styles that will satisfy everyone in your party? Nope. Is parking plentiful and easy? Nope. Can you growler the more coveted varietals? Usually not.\n\nSo in spite of all this, what is the appeal? Simply put Angry Chair makes some of the best beers in the country. Whether you're looking for a mouth puckering sour or a dense pastry stout, Angry Chair can and does knock it out of the park. Producing some of the most flavorful and unique barrel-aged beers I've ever tried, Angry Chair sets the beer game bar high. Burkitshi, an Imperial Sweet stout with cacao, toasted coconut, and Japanese sea salt remains one of my penultimate favorites, rich and laden with flavor it reminds me of an Almond Joy. Another winner, Barrel Aged Popinski with Peanut Butter & Marshmallow tastes like a fluffernutter. A bottle we got lucky enough to enough to happen upon by pure happenstance, Bourbon Barrel Dave's Barleywine, had an excellent malt backbone and tasted like toffee.\n\nThe taproom itself is trendy and industrial, with cool metal bone seats that are more decorative than comfortable. Funky art scattered about, and of course the many references to \"angry\" chairs make for a laid back atmosphere. While by no means a spots bar, they do have a couple of televisions as well should you want to watch the game with a cold brew. Be warned though, the space itself isn't particularly large, so it may not be the best spot for a big group (although occasionally you can snag one of the coveted few more sizable tables).\n\nWhile unfortunately I don't live close enough to synchronize my visits for every release, Angry Chair is my \"must do\" brewery every time I'm in Tampa, just in the hopes that I will strike the jackpot and pop in when they've just released something sinfully delicious. If it isn't already on your brewery bucket list make sure to put it near the top, Angry Chair produces the kind of stuff that both well seasoned beer geeks and novice drinkers will dream about.", "date": "2018-05-26 17:57:42"}, {"_key": "2163677", "_id": "reviews/2163677", "_rev": "_fNyzD42--c", "review_id": "nSaLQgJg5F2XUFFQmcmowA", "user_id": "q7iWal_rXNSHkHeCMMvZxQ", "business_id": "JLixvCikc5JYGcnvaqHoJg", "stars": 4, "useful": 5, "funny": 2, "cool": 5, "text": "A girl walks into a bar right as a band prepares to play, and goes to take a look at the drink menu.

A conference center and hotel, Gaylord Opryland offers ample walking paths, multiple restaurants, a river boat ride, a salon and spa, and now a water park as well. It is quite the labyrinth and is easy to get lost despite the signposts peppered throughout, although this often makes for the best exploration. While the hotel isn't located in the heart of downtown Nashville, it isn't a terribly far drive either.\n\nTaking a stroll through the atriums is like being in a tropical oasis. There are multiple waterfalls, streams, and lush foliage. While I have no idea what any of it has to do with Nashville itself or its history, it is quite lovely. The strategically placed oversized guitars feel a bit out of place, and yet seem more authentic to the local flavor. Compared to Gaylord Palms in Orlando which actually has decor centered around Florida (Evergaldes, Key West, and Saint Augustine), I felt less of the connection to the city here. However, I can't deny that the hotel is still quite picturesque. Visit around Christmas, and the entire hotel is bedecked in holly and strings of twinkling lights as well.\n\nLike any major hotel,\u00a0Gaylord Opryland\u00a0\u00a0comes with its pros and cons. The parking is high on my annoyance list, because although it is ample, it is pretty steep extra on top of the cost of your actual room. Whether\u00a0you are a short term visitor, or a hotel guest, expect to pay around\u00a0$32 a day.\u00a0Also the restaurants are plentiful (think Italian, Mexican, sushi, and a grill), but none are particularly great. They do have Starbucks on premises if you are short on time, but walk or drive across the street to\u00a0Nashville Coffees\u00a0for a better selection and more interesting options.\n\nIf you are staying on business or at the hotel for a conference, the conference center is massive and quite convenient. There is more than enough space for an exhibition hall and smaller rooms for more intimate talks. WiFi is available throughout the area if you need to sneak away to get work done on your laptop. Speaking of the WiFi, you can also connect throughout the grounds or in the hotel rooms, and they have a direct wired connection if you need something faster, which makes a better choice if you need to connect to a VPN or are on a call.\n\nThe rooms themselves are comfortable, although certainly some sections are better than others. For example, a room in Magnolia may have you in a fairly basic look (your standard outdated hotel) and a view of a courtyard/pool, whereas in Delta the rooms seem to be a bit more modern, and if you're lucky you can get a view of one of the domed areas, which makes for great people watching.\n\nWorth visiting at least once, even if you aren't a hotel guest!

Style-wise it competes with any number of higher-end wineries.  Wine tastings are fairly inexpensive, and ranges from $7-$12.  They do seem to offer quite a broad range of wines, with an especially large number of sweet wines.  Personally, I decided to spring for the \"Lux\" flight and found almost none of them to my liking, but everyone has different preferences.  I don't think there is anything wrong with cheaper wine, and in fact, I believe there are many great wines that are relatively inexpensive.  That being said, there just wasn't much complexity, and there seemed to be unpleasant lingering aftertastes with many that I tried.  I also didn't appreciate that my entire tasting was a sales pitch for my server, during which time I was forced to endure endless droning about the perks. \n\nWhen I finally got around to dining, the menu seemed on par with your average chain.

Having said that, the burger was cooked properly and the flavors worked well together.  I ordered some wilted spinach on the side (mediocre) and truffle fries.  Let's talk about those truffle fries for a bit.  I know more people are apparently into the sweet potato fries here, but I think they are missing the boat.  Burger Up's truffle tries have pleasant aroma, taste great, and are the perfect texture for soaking up oil.  If you are on a diet, it is true you should skip these delightful fries.  But if that were the case, why are you at a burger joint in the first place?  Seriously, if you get nothing else out of my review, please do yourself a favor and order the truffle fries.  \n\nBurger Up also boast an interesting beer menu with semi-obscure breweries from the Deep South included in the list.  I tried a pecan-infused amber from Mississippi - not bad.  I could imagine Burger Up could be a decent place to drink for a bit after eating.  \n\nIf I attended Vanderbilt, I would probably go here on a moderately frequent basis.  If you want a change from the dive bar hamburger, Burger Up is a decent change of pace.", "date": "2012-01-03 19:26:16"}, {"_key": "2124411", "_id": "reviews/2124411", "_rev": "_fNyzCd2--G", "review_id": "hf0LpZSsfqOW-7QULQpFuw", "user_id": "K7thO1n-vZ9PFYiC7nTR2w", "business_id": "OINbC0rpDVJ5bfxt3LO9fw", "stars": 4, "useful": 3, "funny": 3, "cool": 3, "text": "3.50 stars.

Nashville's unique contribution to Southern cooking entails the preparation of fried chicken basted in a fiery combination of peppers and spices that absolutely will send you running to the closest fire hydrant to squelch the burning sensation where your lips and tongue once resided.  Mr. Bolton will make you hot chicken from almost any part of the bird, and he will even do it with chicken tenders should you choose (which comes with the welcome addition of ranch sauce to alleviate some of the heat).  I opted for wings and a call to the fire department.  \n\nAside from the heat, it should be mentioned that Bolton's approach favors flavor.  The wings themselves were fried perfectly and reminded me why I frequently hold my head in only mildly feigned agony when eating \"Southern food\" in places like my current hometown of Washington DC.  The green beans at Bolton's, flavored liberally with bacon, were so impressive that I ended up ordering green beans at nearly every single restaurant and dive that I visited in Nashville.  I assumed it was a Nashville thing; I was wrong -- it is a Bolton's thing.  Maybe some pseudo-celebrity chef should visit Bolton's and say it was the best thing (s)he ever had; it certainly was the case for me when it comes to green beans.  The mac-n-cheese is also very nice with heavy use of white cheddar and liberal amounts of black pepper.  If you like a \"bready\" mac-n-cheese, this is probably not your style.  I thought it was delicious.  \n\nMr. Bolton himself was an appreciate and friendly man who probably should have been annoyed that two rather inebriated individuals were awkwardly ordering (ex. me: what's the one that is hot chicken?  Bolton: i can make any of them hot chicken?  me: ok, i'm confused now) but he helped us out anyhow.  I know Nashville loves this business, but if I ever find out how to teleport people, Mr. Bolton is coming to Washington DC.  But at least you got my lack of an advanced degree in any engineering on your side.  Outside of a moment of idiot savant-like genius on my part, you are probably safe.  \n\nFinally, although it rarely happens, there are a few somewhat misguided reviews that lament that the chicken wasn't spicy enough when they ordered MILD or make similarly obvious patently illogical complaints.  There is a saying that the inability to appreciate the Mona Lisa speaks more about the criticizers than the actual work.  I feel the same way about the plebeian fools that dare to defile a culinary gift from the Gods (or, in this case, a gift from the able hands of Mr. Bolton and his staff).  Bolton's is divine and is a foodie must for anyone visiting Nashville.  Unless you are vegetarian or hate chicken, to visit Nashville and not try hot chicken from Bolton's is about as despicable as going to Vanderbilt and cheering for the University of Tennessee.  It simply should not happen under any circumstances.  As for locals, if you haven't been here, then I would highly recommend that you support this culinary gem of a local business.", "date": "2012-01-03 16:04:12"}, {"_key": "3198287", "_id": "reviews/3198287", "_rev": "_fNy0AmO--b", "review_id": "fmet4HphmADVS24Gk6ok4w", "user_id": "K7thO1n-vZ9PFYiC7nTR2w", "business_id": "Z8qGOmU8YxDjLPBbrz84Yw", "stars": 5, "useful": 9, "funny": 4, "cool": 11, "text": "While I will readily admit that gelato isn't exactly my first love, I can still appreciate the obvious work that goes into the preparation of the creations at Capogiro.

But if there is a better karaoke experience than Cat's Meow anywhere in the country, I've yet to see it.   \n\nNow I've seen some people complain about the drinks here but Cat's Meow knows its audience.  Namely, the idea of serving drinks in glass is simply a terrible idea when you have patrons so obviously beyond their usual limits.  To wit, by the time we reached the second floor to take a Roman Colosseum view of the events below, two girls from a bachelorette party - one the bride and another an aging bleached blonde with a silicone chest - were fighting for crowd attention and eventually each other (silicone kicked the bride on the karaoke floor!).  No one wants glass in a venue like that.  \n\nBy the way, if you don't particularly care to karaoke or dance, may I strongly suggest this second floor?  From our original vantage point, you get a bird's eye view of all the lunacy.  For example, we watched a horrific breakup (the girl grabbed another man's you know what right in front of her man), people falling on stage, the best drunk dancing ever, and the obligatory drunk people coupling from the balcony.   \n\nThe range of songs offered by Cat's Meow is quite good.  But what really makes the event are the MC's who bring the party back every single time after a bad song.  These dudes can sing, dance and are pretty much a bachelorette's dream as they are pretty sculpted too.  Their ability to bring energy back into a place is borderline magical.  \n\nIt was my friend's b-day, and I was proud that she left the second floor and was having fun dirty dancing with the MC's.

On the way out, drunk guy walked up and said \"If I weren't so drunk, I'd ask you out.\" And I said \"If you weren't so drunk we might take you seriously\".\n\nOk, but here's the real story. When I was living on the east coast (and wild), one of my friends lived in SF and the rest of us would celebrate her birthday without her. One year her birthday coincided with a friend's husband's birthday, for which she had rented out the upstairs room of the London. Since it was such a fancy occasion, we made a 15 inch cutout of our friend in SF (we'll call her Cutout J) and took her out for the night.  Cutout J was a huge hit as she posed for pictures down other people's pants and shirts, pictures of people licking her, pictures of her hanging out with the monkeys painted on the wall of the upstairs bathrooms (I have the photos, I know I wasn't imagining them). The waiters working the party were in love with Cutout J and asked to keep her. I said sure, as long as they didn't throw her away.

I've spend many an idyllic afternoon/evening here. I've also booked several of my colleagues at the Mazarin when they've come to New Orleans and heard good things from them (as recently as January 2015).\n\nSo when looking to book a hotel for a work conference 10 people I was leading, Hotel Mazarin was at the top of my list. And when you realize that in other local hotels you're probably going to get that New Orleans jenk known as \"charm\"  for a similar price, I will absolutely recommend Hotel Mazarin for being immaculate (with one tiny exception in my bathroom, but I'm insane), amenities (almost Westin-quality beds, flatscreen TVs), and the restrained modern baroque decor (gold fixtures, marble floors). If you're a breakfast-lover, you cannot beat that deluxe complimentary breakfast (eggs & bacon, pastry, toast, cereal, juices). Seriously, I've stayed in New Orleans hotels with TVs straight out of the 90s, ancient (as in, not antique) beds, dated decor and questionable levels of cleanliness. I won't name names (search my reviews if you must). But Hotel Mazarin boasts higher standards. \n\nThat said, my colleagues and I had some issues during our stay last month that should be noted. \n\n-multiple reports of the front desk/reception staff being aloof and often downright surly (unacceptable and so not typical of the superb hospitality that is the custom of New Orleans. I'm honestly scratching my head over this one). One of my people was reprimanded for putting a room card/key in her wallet when she came down to report that her keys weren't working (she never put it in her wallet but even if she had?!) When she explained that she had done no such thing, the response from the desk was an eye roll. Another colleague called the desk to report that his room was noisy. With a week of late nights and early mornings ahead of him, he thought he could request a quieter room. He was informed that he was in a quiet room. That's it. No apologies or explanations. I can write more, but in the interest of space, I leave it at these two instances. \n\nHowever, all of the other hotel staff were great, from management to catering (special props to the lovely Mary who took care of our conference room. She is a gem!) Everyone in the breakfast room and in catering were ALL so lovely and friendly (everyone says good morning and the catering manager walked around talking to everyone, making sure they were having a great stay). \n\n-the showers are extremely tricky to work and some of us didn't have anything hotter than lukewarm water. This is horrible to deal with first thing in the morning on one of the coldest weeks in New Orleans. I live here and I know the city's water pressure leaves a lot to be desired, especially in old French Quarter buildings, but this isn't OK in a hotel. Apparently there was some trick to get it to work and I can't even tell you what that is, because it's really *that* tricky. There should be instructions posted, unless this was a fluke with half of my colleagues' rooms. \n\n-catering: although the food is good, it's extremely overpriced for what you get. You are not allowed to bring in outside food, so if you're using their conference room you're going to have to use these services. I know this is common practice in hotel conference rooms, so although I won't fault them for this, next year I'll try and find an alternative.\n\nRelated to this: when setting up my catering order, I specified that three of my group had dietary restrictions/extreme food allergies. For the very expensive muffaletta sandwiches, I thought they'd at least offer a GF bread option for one or two of them for my G/F colleague, but no. Second, I was told the king cake would be nut free and it was not. Suddenly I saw one of my colleagues leaving the room in the middle of a session and I later learned that he had to go up to his room and take an emergency Benadryl. If he hadn't, he likely would have needed to go to the hospital, for his nut allergy is that extreme. If I put on my request that at least one dessert should be nut free and the only other dessert item is pralines, the cooks should pay attention and not put nuts on the king cake. Pretty simple. Attention to detail is crucial. Again, when you're paying extremely high prices for catering, high expectations should be met.\n\nI would still recommend Hotel Mazarin thanks to its amazing location for visitors to our city, as well as the nice perks, including two comped drinks at the fabulous 21st Amendment Bar. Plus it's just nicer all around than other FQ hotels in this price range.", "date": "2015-04-03 17:12:46"}, {"_key": "1860151", "_id": "reviews/1860151", "_rev": "_fNyy4U6--P", "review_id": "4HJRzQemA9xT715cltgJtQ", "user_id": "0G-QF457q_0Z_jKqh6xWiA", "business_id": "ltBBYdNzkeKdCNPDAsxwAA", "stars": 3, "useful": 10, "funny": 4, "cool": 5, "text": "The simply-named Tavern offers up some mighty simple comfort food pleasures (White Trash hash, anyone?) and elevated junk food game bites. \n\nThat said, I'm not sure this is quite the weekend brunch place for me, due to the TVs providing all of the background noise.

It's discouraging to note that even though I don't really even wear them anymore, they are slowly but surely disintegrating (especially my 1920s and 30s numbers).

My mom would always regale me with stories about her times at Hawaii Kai in Manhattan in the 60s. As a child, I'd cherish our annual trips to Mai Kai in Fort Lauderdale (which still exists, apparently!) Fun fact: About 5 years ago, I was a featured bartender in Inked Magazine where I talk about making Tiki drinks (you can see the photo in my profile), as I worked in a Tiki bar in NYC (Waikiki Wally's RIP).\n\nSo, yeah. I'm a lover all things Tiki, though I have to admit, I hate loathe and despise sweet drinks for obvious reasons, but hell, it's a Yelp review so I'll just come out and say it: usually sweet drinks mask cheap liquor. Usually sweet drinks are meant for people who aren't drinkers and can't stand the taste of alcohol. And last but certainly not least, sweet drinks mean for inevitable hangover. I pride myself on being a veteran drinker and at most, get one hangover a year. In fact, my year anniversary of my last hangover is coming up. July 4. \n\nThe fabulous thing is, Tiki Tolteca offers up *craft* Tiki drinks. Yes, you're reading that correctly. Look at my menu photos that detail the ingredients! They even offer up little stories with each drink. Their cocktails don't only feature rum, but such lovely spirits as my beloved Mezcal, and my much less beloved ca\u00e7aca. I settled on a Hemingway Daiquiri, which is frozen and perfect because it's not a fruit daiquiri, so not filled with artificial nonsense, just lime, rum, & maraschino liqueur. And potent, seeing as I was feeling a nice buzz after two.\n\nThey also have a menu feature small plates with a tropical flavor. DO NOT PASS UP THAT CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE DESSERT. The Tiki gods command it, too. Seriously. It really is the stuff of the gods. Chocolate, coconut, banana sauce... 'scuse me while I talk in tongues. I look forward to going back and trying the sweet corn tamales (vegetarian!). No crab rangoons, though, thankfully (created at Don the Beachcomber and now for some reason is expected on any given Chinese restaurant menu for some perplexing reason).\n\nOh!! Be sure and order a High Life, if you're so inclined, so you can get the full bottle service experience. This is no joke. They serve it in Champagne glasses and ice your bottle. Luckily my drinking partners indulged so I didn't have to.\n\nMore fun trivia. You may see in my profile that my current (and forever) crush is Howard Hughes. Apparently there's a tale of him drinking one too many zombies at Don the Beachcomber and then killed a pedestrian with his car. Bad Howie!! I hope it's not true.

That the tea is organic is a huge deal as I recently learned non-organic teas are ridden with pesticides. Not that I'm such a big tea drinker, but in September-October I'm all about dirty chai and by \"dirty\" that means a shot of espresso, not a spray of pesticides! Thankfully they make their own chai and hooray for it not being overly sweetened like that stuff from the box.  They have almond milk in addition to soy, so you don't have to worry about GMO-ridden lattes!\n\nI haven't tried their baked goods, all of which look delectable, but I had lunch once, some kind of vegetarian sandwich that I can't recall other than the fact that it was quite good. If you're in the mood for lunch, be aware that they stop serving it around 2. Bagels and pastries are available all the time, though!\n\nFair Grinds is small and cozy and a traditional coffeehouse in that it's more reminiscent of being in a real house than a sterile storefront/corporate coffee bar. They have community-based activities like Kundalini Yoga weekly and various performances. The staff is so very kind and accommodating and I just love that side verdant patio that's off to the side. It's the kind of place I can easily lose hours in good conversation or a book. But typically I'm working on my laptop, so to that end, you don't have to go crazy scoping out an outlet.

FYI they also have thin crust if that is your thing. Typically, that is my thing, but when in St. Louis, one should do as the St. Louans (is that what they're called?) do. Although, I think St. Louis pizzas are traditionally cracker crust. Ah, there I go again. ANYWAY...\n\nIt was a beautiful spring day on Wednesday, so we sat outside and were immediately taken care of by our friendly waiter who brought us water and drinks (really good house iced tea that is infused with some kind of blossom). We were warned that the deep dish pizzas take 35 minutes to prepare, which was fine with us.\n\nIt was worth the wait. Holy delish, batgirl! I ordered kalamata olives and mushrooms on mine and the sauce to cheese ratio was just perfect. I love the sauce! Chunky tomato, not sweet. Mmmmmm mmmm good. And that crust was just awesome.

Check-ins on the first day closed at 6pm. I arrived at 6:10 due to crazy traffic due to Obama being in town thus causing a regular 30 minute trip to take over an hour.

I think check-in should close a lot later than 6pm, after all, the opening bashes were all going on that night and without your tickets, you can't get in to them (or so I thought. Luckily I was able to get into both Better with Age and the Absolut opening party with my assistant's tickets since she had her media badge). Besides, with people coming in from all over at all times *and* it being that it's in a hotel, next year it would be nice to see extended check-in times.\n\nThat aside, I thoroughly enjoyed my lost week, I mean, incredibly fun-filled week at TOTC. From the volunteer staff who checked you in at each event and seminar (all of them incredibly nice) to the tasting rooms to the hotels and other types of event venues, all I can say is that I was left thoroughly impressed. There was just so much going on, it's impossible to catch everything. I paced myself rather well (time for a pat on the back). \n\nAnd that L'agniappe Lounge. WOW!!! This room, I believe, is only for media and other sponsors, but holy crap. All of the brands and sponsors left swag, product and other fun materials (favorite had to be the moleskine notebooks thanks to Tanqueray or Hennessey-- it's tastefully embossed into the cover). OH!!

Whose idea was that??)\n... not to mention that although there were master mixologists at the bars, they had to make due with the ingredients that were given to them (kind of like the \"Chopped\" for bartenders). I definitely preferred the vodka cocktails to any others.\n\nWhile the booze flowed freely, my tip to attendees is to make sure and pack some energy bars because this event is not about food, so don't expect any.

As such, my car with expired plates remains in Kansas City because I was certain if I drove it down here, I'd be stopped and given an astronomical fine or worse, an astronomical fine and a night in the slammer (trust me, that is just my luck).

My license was set to expire on my birthday in 6 weeks, so I did the unthinkable: I didn't wait until the day before it was going to expire!

I don't know about you, but it's rare to be utterly disappointed after that. Or, perhaps you just don't let yourself be. The importance of good reception should not be overlooked!\n\nWith that in mind, I bring you my review of Ricardo's Italian Cafe. I had been drinking coffee all morning at the fabulous Park Avenue Coffee next door, but alas, a low fat blueberry muffin did not keep me sated for more than 3 hours, so come lunchtime, I checked Yelp and was overjoyed to see an Italian restaurant is located right next door. Especially because St. Louis is known to have some damn good Italian American food!\n\nI was seated by window without even asking. Bonus points again for first impressions here! The menu has a good amount of pasta dishes, but I was dazzled by the eggplant parmesan, as is typical for me. It's offered both as a small plate and as an entree (don't quote me on this, but I believe the full size portion is offered on a lunch special).\n\nMolto sadness: apparently due to the freeze in Mexico, there are no eggplants to be had, as I was told by the waitress. Soooo, if you were hoping to get locally sourced vegetables, well it ain't happening here (I know, I know... eggplant isn't in season in MO right now). I instead ordered the minestrone and penne tossed with garlic, oil and vegetables.\n\nThe Minestrone... I hate to say this, when I wanted to like a place so much (yes, that warm greeting really does go a long way), but it is possibly the worst I've ever had. I hate likening anything in a restaurant to store bought, but this is the stuff that Campbell's Alphabet soup is made of. Inexcusable in an Italian restaurant.\n\nOn to the main course: let's say it made up for the soup in droves. I quite possible inhaled this dish! Delicious pasta, crisp broccoli, fresh mushrooms with just the right amount of olive oil and garlic. Perfection.\n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant lends itself well to both a business lunch or a romantic dinner. There are two cozy dining rooms (you enter through the bar) and while it won't be winning any design awards, it's a familiar kind of scene that conjures up Italian American bistros across the US and I like this sort of thing. It's not garish with pink lighting and marble busts like Anthony's in Kansas City, and several notches above my beloved Milo's here in Saint Louis. \n\nI do think I'd return to Ricardo's when in the neighborhood.

It's Louisiana-owned\n2. They have Cajun hot nuts\n3. Related to the above, they have an array of other NOLA specialty items (tourists, buy your foodie souvenirs here rather than the FQ)\n4. Kick ass olive bar (but just about as pricey as WF's)\n5. They just have a lot more grocery items, and more affordable options at that\n6. Not everything has to be gourmet specialty foods and products. They have those, but sometimes you want a bag of Zapps chips or a harsh cleaning product for eff's sake!\n7. Phenomenal wine/beer selection (see my note about hard liquor below).\n\nThere is no hydrophonic rooftop garden at this one, but that's OK. What they do have that the CBD Rouses doesn't have is a larger and easier to navigate produce section. That said, the organics are still seriously lacking. And what's with the tomatoes imported from Mexico? The store is bigger and there is less of that clusterfuck feeling that you'd expect in any supermarket smack dab in the middle of downtown. \n\nThe popcorn selection is bliss, by the way. An entire section of the snack aisle and I found those black and red popcorn types that promise all kinds of antioxidant benefits. I don't really care, though. I just wanted to buy black popcorn.\n\nOn a distressing note, I cannot believe there is an entire subcategory of Hot Pockets, as noted on the aisle sign (Ie the head category is Frozen and then below it, they have subcategories of normal stuff like pizza, vegetables, fruit etc.) I mean, Hot Pockets are a brand, not a type of food. Actually calling Hot Pockets \"food\" is also a stretch. Sorry, that's just my hatred of convenience foods shining through and has nothing to do with my star rating. But please, for the love of your body: Stop your Hot Pocket habit.\n\nOne thing that is really hella lame: what's with the separate counter for hard liquor? It's just terribly inconvenient and we actually skipped buying the bottle of vodka we had planned on buying because who wants to check out twice at the grocery store?\n\nI think of all the Rouses, my favorite is the one on Tchoupitoulas, followed by Mid-City and CBD at a tie.

The original was dark and red, where the new is drenched in lighter hues, but it's colorless as far as I can tell. The original was cozy and inviting (at least to the likes of me) with Victorian lamps and Soviet memorabilia everywhere. The new is rather devoid of any kind of signature style. Simply put: it's rather bare. And too brightly lit. This brightness makes whomever I bring here want to go elsewhere.

Neruda would never be prone to such clich\u00e9!)\n\nSo, let's just say that the overwhelming vibe of Il Posto is that of a rustic Italian cafe. Not unlike the cafe in the movie Il Postino.

Luckily I exhibit a fair degree of self control. The cruelest irony that ice cream season coincides with swimsuit season. WHATEV, right?\n\nSo, this is the best ice cream I have ever had. Want some cockamamie never-hear-of-before flavors (Green Fairy, anyone?) They've got that here. Die hard traditionalist? They've got you covered (anything from vanilla to butter pecan). Diabetic? There's both an ice cream and a special sundae for you. Can't have dairy? While I didn't see any soy or nut ice creams, they do have sorbet. On a diet? Well, then, I'm afraid you're SOL. There's a kiddie cup, but it's for the kids only. Their small cup *probably* won't kill you too much, though.\n\nFirst visit had me sampling my friend's choice: red velvet cake. While not a fan of red velvet cake, I can't deny this ice cream brings it to a whole new level. Instead of being merely red velvet flavored ice cream, it's got bits of red velvet cake throughout. Scream-worthy, right?\n\nSecond visit, I came with a mission: to try four flavors via the 4 scoop sample (you get 4 small scoops for $4. A bargain, no?) My choices: sweet corn with raspberry and black peppercorn, Green Fairy, butterscotch butter pecan, and blueberry pie, my favorites being the latter two, however I wouldn't throw the other two out of bed... I mean the bowl. Green Fairy wins the creative award because I'd never think to have absinthe-flavored ice cream! It also has bittersweet chocolate and orange peels, which make for a really tasty, unique concoction. My only issue is that I'm not a fan of chocolate bits in ice cream, otherwise, I'd be all over this. Butterscotch butter pecan brings a bit of a more intense, grown up twist to an old timey classic (I had to wonder if there's booze in it). Blueberry pie... sigh. Just perfect. I need a moment alone with it. Perhaps even a year. The sweet corn is a bit too overpowered by the peppercorns and could stand to have more raspberry, in my opinion. That's the *only* criticism I'd have. With all those flavor choices, who cares? Oh and feel free to sample if you're on the fence (but obey the sign: don't be a sample hog).\n\nThe best thing about this ice cream is that it's not crazy sweet. I realize that sounds ridiculous, but it's true. Take the salted caramel, for example (I know you will). I tried my friend's and was quite taken with it. I love the idea of salted caramel but I've had that flavor before at other places and found it sickeningly sweet- not at all salty. Creole Creamery has somehow managed to achieve just the right balance of flavor.\n\nAnd so, I bid Creole Creamery farewell... meaning in this review.

That's nice for a change as you can imagine I'm always being asked to make the choices by friends and family.\n\nMy experience was again good, but not 5-star excellent, given the caliber of the restaurant. It was a Saturday night and the restaurant was reasonably filled, as it was Carnival season and getting close to the big day. My issue was with the lighting. I'm of the mind that at nighttime, unless you're at a diner or fast food joint (and that would be *never* for me), lights should be dimmed and the candles brought out. Not so at Muriel's. Some people hate dimly lit restaurants, so have at it if this is you! \n\nAnother thing, and this is more of a criticism of my fellow Americans than anything: Muriel's doesn't have dress requirements like some of our fancier joints in town, but really, when you go out to a *nice* restaurants with table cloths and a typical bill for 2 is over $100 can you please make an effort?! Or how's this, please don't wear shorts and T-shirts. Or worn out jeans. At least the hostess made the guy take off his baseball cap. On that note, this \"no hats\" rule seems at odds with the fact that they let the table of 4 slobs in anyway. A brightly lit restaurant filled with tables of bachelorette parties (I saw no less than 4 tables of ladies on the prowl) wearing silly wigs and hats do not for a romantic dinner out make. If they are going to ask that gentlemen remove hats (and I get that, even if the hat is a really nice one), it seems they should stay consistent with a more refined vibe. No?\n\nNow that *that* is out of the way...\n\nI started with the wood-grilled Eggplant Reloude. *Incroyable!!!!! So good that I needed to exclaim in French. The eggplant is perfectly grilled and is sweet/smoky with delicioso (see? I did it again) ricotta/marscapone inside and topped with a bit of tomato sauce. Perfetto. (stop, Joi, just stop).\n\nAs I mentioned in my previous review, Muriel's main nod to vegetarians is with a seasonal \"Vegetarian Soiree\" entree. I appreciate the seasonality but last year's vegetable plate was much much better than this year's - I visited during the same season, winter. This time there was a so-so mushroom crepe rather than polenta. There was no kale. There was inedible eggplant that was tough/bitter/chewy. Pickled cucumbers. Pedestrian spaghetti squash. In fact, it was altogether unmemorable to the point that I had to just look at the menu to remember what was on it so I could write this review. Not bad, just nowhere nearly as impressive as last year. Give us vegetarians at least one other exciting option, perhaps? A vegetarian tasting menu? Dare to dream...\n\nOn the other hand, that butterscotch pudding dessert was birthday bliss-worthy.\n\nSo, there you have it. Five star lunch combined with a 2.5 star dinner (five star service and decor) means just hanging in there at 4 stars. I'm still a fan of this legendary and beautiful French Quarter restaurant.

I'm a regular at Lilly's Cafe in the LGD because they have such an incredible variety of vegan dishes and it's insanely cheap. That said, the ambiance lends itself better to lunch (not to mention they close at 9pm and sometimes that's dinner time for me). To add to that, they don't have a bar. This year for my birthday dinner, I wanted Vietnamese food and I wanted a cocktail or two... enter Mint.\n\nFirst of all there's the name conjuring up both minty goodness served alongside a giant bowl of bun or pho and the impression that this place is *mint*. I've wanted to try it since it opened last year, although it's on the other side of town from where I live and I know it gets really packed on weekends.\n\nAmbiance: more spiffy, more... mint than Lilly's, with their mirrors, modern furniture and chandeliers, not to mention a large bar. I'm not too crazy about how bright it is in there and definitely not a fan of the huge TVs, but that didn't detract from all the other greatness going on... like the food and the cocktail I soon had in my hands (I can ignore TVs, but it's funny how the child next to me was transfixed on the Simpsons as soon as he sat down. We need less TVs in restaurants, world!). \n\nGetting back to the cocktail: Mint Iced Tea. GET. IT. On this warm Sunday in February (75 degrees in the evening!), I couldn't resist a taste of summer and even though I typically detest sweetened tea, this drink is on point! I can easily see myself throwing back three of these on a porch somewhere. It goes just as well with the avocado spring rolls I ordered, however. These spring rolls are now my favorite in town, because they are just bursting with fresh ingredients, like mint, avo, carrots, sprouts and vermicelli. Dip these babies into that perfect peanut sauce that comes with. So so so good! \n\nVeg heads get happy for there are options a-plenty. I can't refuse a bowl of bun, and there is a lemongrass tofu option that is brimming over with tofu and vermicelli noodles. Lilly's has an option to add veggies to that, so next time I'll ask if that's possible here because it could only make this better! The lemongrass tofu is spectacularly tasty, with a texture that is crunchy on the outside and slightly firm on the in. Herbs and hot sauce only serve to heighten the fresh flavor that's going on up in here! (side note: please keep those Sri Racha bottles clean... the nozzle had that unsightly crust going on that makes me kind of ill to consider).\n\nDessert? Not for me, as I was far too full. I couldn't even manage a second cocktail (my typical dessert, truth be told). Portions are enormous, but the food quality and freshness do not suffer.

Wouldn't that be cool?\" I mused as everything slowly faded to black. But first I laughed because of course this is what I'm thinking as I'm going under. Aesthetics. They are uber important!\n\nI was referred to Dr. Loyola by my regular dentist at Mid-City Smiles. I'll be honest and say I had misgivings when I walked into what could only be called a dreary waiting room (it's tiny, without windows). I was called into yet another dark, slightly sinister room (I was scared like a baby and I have a terrific imagination. C'mon, laugh with me here) and then realized it had to be this way because, X-rays. But come on, at least make the waiting room inviting?\n\nOK, so I realize how ridiculous this all sounds. The *good* news? Getting my tooth pulled here was 10X more seamless than it was when I got my last one pulled elsewhere three years ago (I'll spare you the horror story). Dr. Loyola had me in and out in about 30 minutes. Can you believe that? I was terrified about going under with anesthesia as last time, I just received novocaine. And that, was horrible, so it didn't take much convincing. My last dentist couldn't get my bottom tooth out (after 20 minutes of yanking. I guess I can't totally spare you from that horror story), and so recommended that I go to a surgeon. Dr. Loyola told me that it's pretty common for the bottom teeth to be more difficult. He was also honest and said that I should just spare myself enduring the procedure while conscious. \n\nOne other thing: he was also honest that the source of my pain could be due to something else (namely, clenching and grinding my teeth) and said that I didn't necessarily have to get the tooth out. I appreciate being conservative rather than \"just get it yanked, you don't need it\" philosophy that's all the rage these days, but I knew it had to go and I was right. \n\nGetting put under was not quite fun (I have these veins that are difficult to tap into) but what I did like was that it was almost twilight-y (not of the glitter and teenaged vampire variety) and I wasn't entirely unconscious. I didn't feel any pain, though I guess I was moving a lot b/c I recall being reprimanded a bit by the doctor. He's more stern than jokey, but whatever. The tooth. Is. Gone.\n\nThe reason for three stars? Their billing policy is utterly absurd and unheard of (to me, at least). Get this: even though my insurance covers anesthesia, I had to lay out the 300+ dollars *just in case they didn't.* What kind of BS is that? Oh and the clincher? The ridiculous % surcharge for using your CC. Because surely it makes sense to carry almost 400 dollars in cash around with you for dental services. It's unacceptable and I won't return here for that reason alone (it cost me well over 30 dollars for the \"convenience\"). I realize you've been burned by patients before but that doesn't exactly instill confidence in your professionalism. I've been to two other dentists in NOLA and they always bill you later if your insurance doesn't cover a procedure.\n\nSo, that's that. I'd give only two stars for the ridiculous payment policy but I was rather impressed by my practically pain and discomfort-free extraction (and that's probably what you really need to care about). Plus the ladies who assist and work the reception are really nice. And yes, I did receive a check from them right away after they were paid by my insurance. This was a month after the procedure was done and I can survive without that 350 dollars in my account but not everyone is that lucky. \n\nOh and another positive note: the room where you get your surgery done is practically cheery, with big windows!", "date": "2015-02-04 22:07:34"}, {"_key": "2409909", "_id": "reviews/2409909", "_rev": "_fNyzZLm--J", "review_id": "7Tk_BgzbENi8tVRFKtgHoQ", "user_id": "0G-QF457q_0Z_jKqh6xWiA", "business_id": "TV_WvVzoSJfVWe-utW651Q", "stars": 5, "useful": 16, "funny": 3, "cool": 7, "text": "First to review this store that I haven't been able to forget since I last visited four long years ago?

I first attended a wedding here on Halloween 2010. My two fabulous friends pulled out all the stops and had an amazing horror movie-themed wedding where Jason and Leatherface got things started with a bang (er, a chainsaw). Sure seems like the folks behind Muriels worked well with my friends and the wedding was an occasion to remember. We were upstairs, where private events are held, and took breaks from the main room in the bordello-like seance room. One of my favorite things about this night included hanging out with cocktails on huge balcony overlooking Jackson Square. \n\nBy the way, if you're dining here and there isn't an event going on, you're free to go upstairs and check all that out. You can even have a drink and bring it up to the Seance Room (and I strongly recommend that you do, if you like rooms dripping in red, chandeliers, velvet and brocade. It makes me want to decorate my entire apartment in a similar fashion). \n\nRecently I came to realize that besides the gorgeous environs, the restaurant serves up some really great food and drink. My friends and I had lunch here recently. We were seated in the room where they open the huge glass doors to the sidewalk so you can watch passersby and listen to music being played out in Jackson Square. \n\nAt lunchtime, they offer $4 Bloody Marys, wines and martinis. I indulged in a Bloody Mary, as I am often wont to do, and found it to be quite satisfactory (garnished with olives, pickled green beans and citrus and served in a pint glass. No skimping here just cuz it's a mere 4 bucks). \n\nI ordered the modestly-named Vegetable Plate. I'll be honest and say I wasn't expecting much because I've had many a pedestrian veg plate where they barely even marinate the vegetables before skewering them and grilling. Booooring. \n\nI'm thrilled to report that Muriel's Vegetable Plate belongs in the Vegetable Plate Hall of Fame. First of all, it contains braised kale. Almost 'nuff said there, but I'll go on to say its flavor is just so so so very good. The other star of the plate is that compact square of polenta flavored with herbs and Parm cheese. Everything is so delicately placed, which I love, and nothing overwhelmed with oils or heavy sauces to \"make up for\" the fact that you're eating a plate of vegetables. There's a delightful little bit of everything from beets to parsnips to tender shittake mushrooms. A healthy, hearty plate. Thank you, Muriels! I seriously could not stop thinking about it all day.\n\nThey also have a gluten-free menu.\n\nI think I'll be dining here on the regular when I have visitors in town.

It actually makes me think of how hotels might have been in the 1960s (though it does not have a consciously retro vibe or look). Classy!!!\n\nThere's a complimentary wine hour. There's art that's not trying too hard. There's comfy couches and shiny wood floors (slight criticism that they need to avoid the orange oil as I almost took a spill a few times).\n\nNot for a minute do they skimp on the amenities you'd expect (bathrobes, killer bath products, amazing rain showers, sumptuous beds), and then some (turn down service with ice, chocolates and bottles of water) \n\nEspresso machines in the hallway are a nice touch seeing as I don't like drip coffee (there are drip machines in the room, if you so desire). I hit these up periodically throughout the day. The gym is a step above any hotel gym that I've used before, with complimentary bottles of water, headphones, green apples and towels for your convenience.

You might feel like a kid at buffet where you can mix & match Pepsi and Mt. Dew and even Dr. Pepper (I was that child once). They have all these varieties and then will do something outrageous like a Pi\u00f1a Colada/Hypnotiq parfait. I stuck to the classic pi\u00f1a and wow, it even tasted like it wasn't filled with that obvious artificial flavor that some daiquiri places typically use (Gene's version is not drinkable, I'm sorry).

When asked by chef/owner Tanzanika what they could do to make the menu more veg-friendly, I suggested having some tofu options, maybe (I just love tofu. I know it's crazy). She laughed but seems like she's open to the idea. It's not even really necessary and if you're open to dairy, they have pizzas that look really great, too. Their emphasis is on FRESH food and yes, they shop daily. My guy had a burger that he said tastes just like \"Mom's burger,\" which for him is a big compliment (for me, not so much.

It's just that I've stayed in all kinds of hotels pretty much my entire life, and I do mean those ranging from budget family joints like Days Inn to luxury hotels like the Hyatt, to smaller, cooler boutique hotels like Hotel on Rivington and now the Moonrise.\n\nI'll be honest with you, the amenities aren't quite as great as those at the W, and so normally I'd give the Moonrise a solid 3 stars (A-OK doesn't mean average in hotel stars, believe me). The Moonrise gets an extra star for the vintage moon photos that are just about everywhere in the hotel. I think decor-wise, Moonrise is my favorite, beating out even the Hotel On Rivingon's sleek rock and roll blood red/black decor! I just love the theme to death!!

I stepped onto the elevator feeling guilty about not being more pleasant.  I really hope that guy wasn't cleaning my room. I do have issues with male housekeeping staff. The very idea of it just creeps me out, especially when traveling alone.\n\nNoise, well, I'll be honest, there was a morning when people were talking way too much in the hall (step to the elevator, please!) and there was a night that I just couldn't sleep due to the crowd spilling out into the street (apparently the lobby has that disco after hours thing going on that the W has) and what was more annoying was the asshole in the room next to me who banged on the wall to indicate that I was talking too loudly on Skype.

It's a good thing that they have a recycling program because I'm getting all three of these candles refilled as soon as they run out. I think gardenia is my favorite, with All That Jazz a very close second. I've never been all that happy with floral candles because they seem almost artificial. Not sure what magic they have going on up in here, but the candles smell like the most intense varieties of blooms and it makes me happy just walking into a room where I have one burning.

Their employees are nice without making you feel like you've committed a sin by asking for plastic (to be fair, the cashiers at WF aren't nearly as self-righteous as the floor staff who seem like they'd spit on you if you ask for something that is against WF puredom, like artificial sweetener. Not that I'd ever ask for it, but a friend once had the audacity to do so and was met with a lecture).\n6. Kick ass olive bar\n7. They just have a lot more grocery items, and more affordable options at that\n8. Not everything has to be gourmet specialty foods and products. They have those, but sometimes you want a bag of Zapps chips or a harsh cleaning product for eff's sake!\n9.

The oils area is confusing not only to shoppers but to employees as well. I had three different employees attempt to find me a vessel in which to pour truffle oil from the jug thingamajig and no one could help me. Not their fault as apparently they had just changed all that around, but no one clued the staff in. \n2. There's just not enough organic produce. It would be ideal as well, if the organic stuff wasn't all mixed in with the other stuff.\n3. Not enough produce in general (uh, dino kale shouldn't be that rare).\n4. Lack of gourmet whole bean coffee\n\n\nNumbers 2-4 have double weight, as I'm all about the organic produce selection. A fine whole bean coffee i(extremely dark roast that I grind myself) is what gets me through a morning. I realize not everyone is as particular as me, but there you have it. Supermarket shopping is painful enough, I'd rather not have to go to more than one store per week.\n\nOther things to note:\n\n-gourmet and deli sections in this Rouses is really outstanding and similar to WF.

There was a hint of an usual spice in there (I'm thinking allspice) that didn't overpower it, but made it extra tasty. I believe they pickle their own green beans too, which may be the reason I was tasting the all spice. If the Bloody Mary is the most complex cocktail, then the bartenders at Maurepas are surely at Mensa level. \n\nThe menu is divided into 2 sections grains, vegetables, and starch and then meat and fish.

You could stay in an AirBnB in a cool neighborhood, but if you don't really know the neighborhoods of this city, it could mean you're in a less desirable/safe area (AirBnB is illegal in some parts of town, including the French Quarter). You could stay in a small local hotel in the Quarter. For the most part, I don't particularly love these as I haven't had the best experiences in them (weak service and amenities). Locally-owned bed & breakfasts are a great option but book quickly. Posh hotels are awesome but $$$ and trendy hotels like the Ace (my favorite) are great but also book quickly as they are smaller so if you're coming during Mardi Gras or JazzFest, you better book ahead. That leaves the solid chains like the Hilton, Hyatt, and of course Marriott. You can't go wrong really!\n\nI was in town during Mardi Gras and couldn't stay in my own house, so we ended up staying here. At $350 a night, it wasn't cheap, but it was literally Mardi Gras weekend leading into Fat Tuesday itself and it could have been a lot worse.\n\nThe best part about this Marriott, other than its edge of the FQ location, is the lobby action. Seriously! It's an attraction within itself. During Mardi Gras you need a wristband to get in to see these sights, as it's right on Canal, the major parade route. Each evening, we'd wind down in the lobby bar. It's expensive for New Orleans and there are better hotel bars out there, but the characters that found their way in and out of here... you can't put a price on people watching. \n\nThere's also a(n expensive) coffee bar serving Starbucks if you need your fix before leaving the hotel, and a very convenient little grocery & souvenir shop that serves liquor, too (no mini bar in the room, which is fine with me because that removes the temptation to dig into a $6 mini can of Pringles.

My friend and I were seated by the bathroom so the line up afforded many a viewing opportunity.\n\nOnto more germane details. I realize not everyone reading this review will be a slobbering male (or female).\n\nAs our cab drove past Bouligny Tavern last night on the way to elsewhere, the positive memories of my stellar experience here just a couple weeks ago had me asking the cab driver to make an immediate U-turn. The Pavlovian response was too much to bear. I needed more of those spectacular small plates.\n\nNow let me tell you about the delicious (and modestly described) fried squash. The absolute best I've ever had. Slices so large had me wondering if they were giving us eggplant instead. They are lightly battered, but what makes these babies sing is the lemon zest sprinkled on top. Gorgeous!! An Amalfi Coast moment in time. I half expected to see the dark, dark sea a hundred feet beneath the terrace I was dining on. Alas, there was no such terrace. And the only indication that we could possibly be on a beach were the aforementioned outfits.\n\nNo matter, I still adore you, Bouligny Tavern.", "date": "2012-07-08 18:54:40"}, {"_key": "3002734", "_id": "reviews/3002734", "_rev": "_fNyz6XW--T", "review_id": "uvORV1GlrtOm0A9fb5q7TQ", "user_id": "0G-QF457q_0Z_jKqh6xWiA", "business_id": "e-fXMT8R3j7BKMTh8xn8aw", "stars": 4, "useful": 18, "funny": 10, "cool": 13, "text": "Chinese food seems to have magical properties, doesn't it? It can satisfy a certain kind of desperate hunger. It can cure hangovers. It can make you feel nourished and possibly invincible. \n\nNew Orleans is severely lacking in Chinese food when you compare it to other major metropolitan areas. There's cheap corner joints a-plenty, don't get me wrong. But I prefer not to walk away from meal swollen for hours due to liberal use of cheap oils, MSG and sodium (even though damn, that shit is good, even at its worst!!!) \n\nBut now, NOLA has Red's Chinese. When I heard that the chef was affiliated with one of my favorite Chinese joints in SF & NYC (Mission Chinese), I knew we had a winner here. Admittedly, I have been meaning to hit this place for over a year, as I heard they had some killer vegan options, but for some reason when I have Asian food urges when I'm in town, I don't even consider Chinese (like, it's not even on the brain) and opt for Sukho Thai or one of my many favorite Vietnamese joints. \n\nI'm so glad I made it a goal to get to Red's because it definitely lived up to my expectations! I love its modest Chinese opium den basement chicness. It fits in so well on the slightly dodgy (but \"up and coming\" as they keep promising) St. Claude corridor, close to Sugar Park and across the way from Saturn Bar. If you're not familiar with the area, don't be turned off by the blighted property right next door or the dudes shooting dope across the street (not trying to be funny, it's just the way it is). Just go on in to Red's and you will not regret it. \n\nI need to note again how much I love the atmosphere. I feel like I'm in Chinatown in NYC back in the early 80s when I'd go in with my mom who had taken up Chinese cooking and would go to grocery stores for supplies. We'd then get dinner at one of the bustling family joints that crowd the blocks. There's just something decidedly cozy about these types of places.\n\nAlthough they were out of the main course I originally came here for (Buddha's Delight), they had another vegan option, bok choy with Chanterelle mushrooms in a black bean sauce. Just the idea of Chanterelle mushrooms in Chinese cooking made me happy because it's not typical (usually it would be Shiitake, which I don't love at all). I also ordered the smashed cucumbers (salty, with tahini and sesame seeds giving it a divine smoky flavor). While their wines by the glass are limited, the chilled Portuguese red is quite good (and they also have frozen drinks and an intriguing cocktail list). \n\nMy entree arrived and I went to town on that thing. Yeah, you just *do this* with good Chinese food. You know what I'm talking about. You're in this food-induced fugue and eat like an animal. Because of that, I don't know how much sense I can make at this point with the words to describe that pile of baby bok choy and chewy mushrooms swimming in a pungent salty black bean sauce. \n\nPortions are large. They suggest the family style thing at the beginning of the meal, which I personally dread because no one wants to share with vegan me, nor do I want to share my vegetables with anyone, so hands-off, OK? \n\nAlthough I can't say much about what my guy ordered, I know the egg rolls were spicy and good and the Kung Pao pastrami that everyone goes on about wasn't really doing it for him, but that's OK because there are a bunch more things I hope he'll go back and try (read: when I make him go back and try;)\n\nWhat would make this five stars? A couple more vegetable options. My dish would have been next level if it had a little protein in it (dare I suggest tofu skin? Really, any type of tofu would be cool). Besides the on-menu Buddha Delight, there's an eggplant dish that I'd be down to check out in the future but wouldn't want to have as a main course.\n\nRegardless, I'm a fan and can't wait to return!", "date": "2016-07-27 14:48:21"}, {"_key": "3037778", "_id": "reviews/3037778", "_rev": "_fNyz7Xu--Y", "review_id": "SgFBOIeRacij-Q6YnnhBGQ", "user_id": "0G-QF457q_0Z_jKqh6xWiA", "business_id": "EHhwVLuIIrq4somySU0m8A", "stars": 4, "useful": 11, "funny": 5, "cool": 8, "text": "What better way to enjoy a perfect weather late spring evening in New Orleans!

The cocktail list is a compelling list of drinks made with all sorts of spirits, not just rum, with cool names like Mississippi Mermaid and Pontchartrain Pearl Diver (in addition to your classic Zombie and Mai Tai). Ambiance offers a dark, lush bar side (I'm so sitting there next time) and the bamboo-filled, more brightly lit dining room that lends itself better to eating. And really, you should eat here. \n\nYes, you can eat here if you're veg, G/F etc. How refreshing. They had me with this statement: \"Executive Chef Chris Shortall and his staff are dedicated to creating beautifully composed, modern, playful Tiki Cuisine that includes options for our gluten-free, vegetarian, and vegan guests.\" I guess I can't stress enough how it good it feels to not have to get apologies and confusion from a waitress and the dreaded/reluctant \"I'll have to check with the chef.\" Other NOLA establishments would do well to start with such a welcoming policy. \n\nAs part of my birthday weekend, I landed here for the first time and I'm an immediate L29-lover.

What a brilliant twist to sprinkle a little Chinese Five Spice on there, which goes well with the ginger liqueur of course. I then couldn't pass up the idea of Frank Sinatra's favorite Tiki drink and ordered the Navy Grog, which comes with a straw inserted into a huge cone of ice. I knew what I was in for... an extremely strong concoction worthy of Old Blue Eyes, but a little too rumtastic for me, so I switched back to the 504. If you're a fan of strong rum drinks, however, do order the Navy Grog.\n\nLove the atmosphere. Love the cocktails. Love the service (everyone is so nice).

If you're first in, 3 or 4 friends could easily follow, so be sure and figure out who has the smallestl bladder and put them on the end). Large booths makes group dining a much cozier experience.\n\nNot surprisingly, the margarita menu is larger than the food menu here. I'm a plain, on the rocks, salted rim kind of gal, so that kind of thing is lost on me. I'm also not a tequila connoisseur, but if you are, I daresay you'll be satisfied here. \n\nWe started up with an order of table side guac, which is only available on Thursday-Saturdays, so we were out of luck. To be honest, I don't see the allure of table side guac, unless you're really opposed to some of the usual ingredients. I can totally understand this of course, because too many onions can ruin a good guac. That said, a regular order of guac here is very impressive and delicious! The aforementioned onion overload is not a problem, I'm happy to report, and the avocados used within are top notch. The chips and salsa that come out on the table, gratis, are also excellent (let me lament the lack of good salsa in any of the dozens of Mexican restaurants in Kansas City. A major, Mexican't, KC!)\n\nNext up, the tortilla soup which yay, is vegetarian! Unheard of, in my experience. So props to Rosalita's for serving up a tasty tortilla soup that omnivores and vegetarians can enjoy.\n\nThe vegetarian burrito, on the other hand, not so good. I had asked the waiter if one of the sauce choices was dairy based because it looked like the word \"ranch\" was implied (however, if it was more like ranchero sauce, then, awesome. In the Midwest, I must ask, due to the popularity of that detestable dressing). Our waiter said he didn't think so, but when our food came out, and I saw the sauce, I was immediately suspicious. I didn't take a bite, but dipped my fork into it. Sure enough, this burrito baby was smothered in ranch dressing. As I considered this to be an abomination (I'm sorry!), I had to send it back, which I rarely ever do, but under these circumstances...The manager immediately came over and offered to rectify the situation (I mention this because in a previous review someone spoke of the lack of managerial presence in the restaurant). I ordered a tomatillo sauce instead.\n\nI wish I had taken a bite of the first burrito, though, because then I would have changed my order altogether. Instead of being stuffed with a variety of vegetables, it was stuffed with onions. Yes, those damn onions. Personally, I don't consider onions to be a vegetable, but a condiment, so they shouldn't be the main ingredient in a vegetable dish.There were also a few pieces of squash strangled by long strands of onions and a little bit of rice and beans. The tortilla must have been the size of a basketball because it seemed you go through blanket folds of it to get to the inside. Not a fan. Really, really not a fan. \n\nI would return here and order something else. Or I could just stick to chips, guac and a large tortilla soup and be pretty happy.

I'm not going to share on FB lest my mom read it and become disappointed in me for being extremely unladylike and perhaps even a bit graphic on Yelp. But I look at it as my duty to protect prospective customers from horrific experiences like the one I recently endured. \n\nStupidly, when making the appointment, I didn't ask for Nelly this visit. Let that be known from the get go as I've had Nelly done my wax jobs before and found her to be top notch. \n\nI've waited several days since the appointment to make sure I didn't write the under the influence of pain or anger. \n\nI won't name the technician in this review. I'm in this conundrum. I don't want to mess with this torturer's, I mean *woman*'s livelihood, but I also can't help but think she should find another career. Say, prison guard. At Rikers. I'm sorry, but I don't think those folks deserve that either. \n\nI can't tell if she's a true sadist, because despite some awkward conversation held for seconds while my most tender region was being ripped and pulled repeatedly, she was silent. Instead of keeping my mind off of the procedure at hand, all I could do was silently scream in my head, as I quivered and begged for the bullet. I would have rocked, too but that's hard to do in goddess pose. \n\nNow I ask you, wouldn't any seasoned professional technician NOT pour hot wax onto the same spots over and over again? But this woman did just that and kept doing that with no more than a \"You need to get numbing cream from your doctor next time.\" Like there would be a next time. No GYN exam has been 1/10 as traumatic. \n\nI had to wonder... am I being punked? But, no. There were no cameras. Just the bitter glare of the high wattage light bulbs overhead burning into my retinas. Say something? I *yelled* something. Twice. And it wasn't \"Kelly Clarkson!\" Safe words don't exist in the waxing world, my friends. I would have made her stop but I knew I'd be paying greatly for this \"service\" whether I continued or not (Earthsavers, in their infinite wisdom, charges you for \"missed\" appointments and warn you repeatedly when making the appointment). \n\nSo, after 15 minutes I turned off and went into survival mode where I was staring into space barely existing anymore. Seriously. In that moment I became one with Sybil. I composed songs. Sonnets. Yelp reviews. This horror show lasted a full 35 minutes. It never took that long before.\n\nSo, Earthsavers, I bid you farewell. I loved Nelly but I will never step foot into your place again when I know that you keep on a woman who should not be allowed to bear a wax wand. No less in a posh spa where a Brazillian runs you 70 bucks before tip. That's the thing. If you're going to charge more than anywhere else in town, then you better damn well be sure your technicians are top notch. Or at least capable. And there's this thing where when you're done with getting a service at a so-called posh spa, where they ask you how was everything.

One was a tourist and one was someone who moved here a year ago and they were talking manicures. And how it's impossible to get your nails done for cheap in this city. I took that as a warning and waited until I absolutely had to get the job done (I hope no one saw my cuticles in the meantime). I come from the land of the cheap nail salon and once I left a couple years ago came to realize that people in the US pay a pretty penny to have decent nails.\n\nSee, I practically go in kicking and screaming. To pay a lot for this is adding insult to injury. It's just that it's an uncomfortable experience for me to have some stranger handling my paws. I hate that it takes well over an hour, no matter how fast they are and in that time, I obviously can't use my hands to get work done or check my phone. And I have sensitive feet and hate the way some of these pedicurists use their crazy strong hands to wring them out like they are trying to kill small animals. Then when it comes time for the manicure I am usually made fun of and told I have baby nails or \"so short!\" I hate long nails!! I use my hands a lot. I hate having nails past the nail bed. Yes, they are small. Whatever. At least they aren't covered in rot, bitches.\n\nSuffice to say, I just hate the entire experience. What I hate even more is paying top dollar for it. At Star Nails, a regular manicure/pedicure is 39 dollars. \n\nAnd then there's the inevitable: After all this, after wasting a precious 90-120 minutes, I WILL smudge my nails. Unless I get gel or shellac, but if a regular manicure was this pricey, I didn't want to even think about getting shellac. \n\nThe good:\nThe salon is large. You won't have to wait. There's a big fish tank you can gaze at to calm down while your hands and feet are being mauled, I mean, tended to. My nail tech was fine, not overly talkative and I guess I felt like she only hated me a little (let's be real here, don't you always feel like they hate you?), and that was when I immediately smudged the so-so polish job she did on my fingernails. My toenails, which usually stay pretty pristine for the most part, already have a chip in them four days later and forget my fingernails, they are toast. (the polish was definitely too thick. I sat for twenty annoying minutes under the dryer and they still smudged a half hour later. the next day I was using tape and that meant goodbye manicure).\n\nSo, I've learned a couple things:\n1.

Perhaps it's just a conditioned response to the delights that I know are in store for me, as I slip between the racks and start hunting. \n\nI have an ardent appreciation for clothing pre- 1967. From what I could see, Retro Active has mostly 50s/60s/70s... some 80s (in my world, that ain't vintage. Well, at least I don't want to admit it's vintage), but we'll forgive them for that little transgression (and I do realize the kids today love wearing this stuff so they can be all ironic and stuff). Sure, I'd love to see earlier decades represented here and other stores, but it's increasingly rare with each passing year. I try to keep care of my 20s-40s clothing and really can't even wear it anymore because all too often it falls apart *as I'm wearing it*.\n\nUnlike some earlier reviews suggest, I don't find this store at all overwhelming, nor did I see anything \"creepy\" or \"bizarre.\" It's just a vintage clothing store with a decent selection. Maybe there's another part of it that I didn't see? Wait, maybe *I'm* creepy and bizarre?\n\nLoved the window displays for St. Paddy's day and the cute pup who greeted me at the door. The ladies who work here are helpful without being overbearing. Seriously, I don't know if there's been a change in ownership or what, but this store is just like the vintage clothing stores I've loved forever. Prices seem to be competitive with stores I've shopped in Chicago, San Fran and Kansas City. And yes, a bit lower than New York, where I rarely if ever can even find decent vintage anymore. \n\nI adore beaded vintage sweaters from the 1950s. Often these are very pricey little numbers, especially if in good condition, as they can be quite fragile. I've had a few that I had to toss just because everywhere I went, I would rain tiny beads. While that may sound all magical and stuff, it really sucks. Retro Active has a decent selection of these sweaters. I found a lovely cream colored one for about 70 dollars (and the beads were tightly sewn in). Only it's over 80 degrees out today and I just couldn't justify buying it, when I have a drawer full of these babies and barely anything that's remotely presentable for warm weather. It was hard, but I put it back.\n\nIf you like vintage jewelry, hats, gloves and other accessories, you will love love love this store, by the way. I even saw a gorgeous old umbrella. Even umbrellas were pretty back in the day. I'm sure these were less dispensable, unlike nowadays when you buy a cheap umbrella for a single use. They have plenty of coats, too and a nice selection of vintage lingerie. Another irresponsible purchase I almost made: a princess style nylon nightgown that's similar to one I have and wear as a dress. I guess one only needs one of these, though, right?\n\nIn closing, as much as I'm trying to make more responsible purchases these days, due to my an closet that holds close to 100 vintage items, stores like Retro Active are still a hell of a lot of fun and one day soon, it's inevitable that I'll be off the budget wagon, so I'm glad it's here in New Orleans!", "date": "2012-03-16 22:21:30"}, {"_key": "3390891", "_id": "reviews/3390891", "_rev": "_fNy0ReG--Q", "review_id": "80CR7E75iMHig9onnNGNAg", "user_id": "0G-QF457q_0Z_jKqh6xWiA", "business_id": "al3Ri6TEqa2rBzjHsn0T_g", "stars": 4, "useful": 11, "funny": 2, "cool": 5, "text": "I have my favorite coffee shops in town in which to sit, socialize and/or work, but I can easily say that Merchant makes the best Americano with steamed soy.

I mean, deep fried Chinese noodles served alongside miso soup... have you ever? I chalked it off to purely unintentional camp. That said, the miso soup is really damn good, not fishy tasting like other miso soups I've had, as traditionally there is some bonito (fish) stock involved in the making. \n\nI went with my gut and ignored the other regional cuisines and had my sushi usual- avocado cucumber roll, which was done right, although jeez, could they spare a couple more sesame seeds on the rice? My plate happened to be sans ginger/wasabi. Sure, sure, I could have shared my guy's, but I happen to typically eat all the ginger that comes with. Also, I know that's a huge no-no in any place that takes their sushi seriously. When I worked in an authentic Japanese restaurant, if I accidentally grabbed a sushi plate off the bar before the chef had garnished it, he would really freak out, so I learned quick. \n\nLuckily Hoshun's staff is really great and attentive, so I received a small dish of the missing gingerwasabi right quick, despite it being a busy night, and despite the fact that they had the bartender waiting tables in between shaking up tons of girly girl martinis for the table of 20 next to us. Oh and add me to the annoying martini orders. Two lychee martinis. I couldn't resist! Props to George.

Otherwise, that menu needs some help, i.e. editing, I think. They really americanize everything-- even the sushi names are in English. Most of us know sushi by the Japanese word (toro, unagi, kappa, tekka etc.) My boyfriend was actually thrown off to the point where he didn't even know what to order. Funny, but true! Again, I'll bring up the issue with serving Chinese fried noodles with the soup. That's not authentically Chinese, but authentically Chinese for Americans (I'm kind of surprised they don't have Chicken Chow Mein on the menu). Believe me, I am not implying I'm up for eating authentic Chinese delicacies either, but some balance would be cool.  As such, the restaurant feels a bit dated. Sure in the first half of the century, Americans flocked to Chop Suey joints, thinking they were eating exotic foods of \"The Orient,\" but I think we've evolved since then.

I like Mahoney's, though they always have that line plus it takes 20 min or more to serve you. So unless I'm willing to kill an afternoon (which is never), it's not happening.

I was pretty thrilled to see a dedicated vegetarian section of the menu and although it's not exactly thrillsville in options, you never can go wrong with a Caprese sandwich, right? Vegans can get a plain ol lettuce and tomato sandwich which makes me really glad I'm not vegan anymore, just sayin'. I think there is a French fry one, too and that's about it. I was just happy to see that I didn't have only one (fried) option!\n\nThe sandwich can be ordered in small (6 inches) or large (12 inches). I ordered a large, figuring I'd eat the other half for lunch the next day. I advise that you don't do this because the balsamic vinegar soaks through the bottom half of the bread and makes it a kinda gross mush, so it does not hold up very well. So suck it in and eat up both halfs. You know you want to.\n\nThe sandwich comes absolutely loaded with ingredients! The mozz is fresh, possibly Buffalo, not sure, but definitely not the low moisture stuff. It will come out cold, just like a Caprese salad. Oh and I recommend the potato salad, too.

For those of you who don't know, Alexis was a popular teacher at Life Yoga on Magazine Street before moving out on her own.\n\nThe originator of \"funky flow\" (as far as I know), Alexis' classes offer a vigorous Vinyasa class (*at your level* as they are open to all levels) to hip hop/R&B and dancey pop music. Yes, this goes outside the \"yoga box,\" so if you're used to traditional citar/chanting and a soft spoken teacher it may be jarring at first. Alexis teaches the class in a spirited way with a unique voice and presentation. It really gears you up to get going  and flow, flow, flow your heart out and I love it. \n\nBesides all of this, classes are the lowest priced you'll find in the city, at only $5 a class. The room is large and mirrored, the floor is wood (it's meant for dancers, after all) and at a comfortable temperature.\n\nI mention all of this because I've realized that this is rather important to me. Don't get me wrong. I like to sweat, but I like to sweat because I'm generating my own sweat, not due to a room being 90 degrees (or if you practice Bikram, well over 100 degrees). \n\nYesterday, I took a class at Life, who has some of my favorite teachers in the city, that had me a little less than blissful by the end of it. The reason for this? The room was stifling to the point that I couldn't hold postures because I was slipping off my mat. Windows and front door open and fans running should be a requirement if the a/c is off. In addition to this, they pack in students to the tiny railroad studio to the point where if you're next to the wall, you're kind of blocked *and* due to this, one of the students knocked a statue off and onto the floor, creating a mess of debris all over my mat. Sure, I can try and be as yogini-like as the next person, but it was a bit much to handle. I'm really at the point where if I have the time to not just run across the street to practice, I'm going to practice elsewhere. I love Life, I love the teachers, but I think they've outgrown their space. Bravo for them... and it's great to see so many people into yoga here in New Orleans (where I love practicing more than anywhere else b/c it's so much less competitive in feel than, say, New York City).\n\nI feel bad that I'm littering Crescent Lotus' page with all of this when I'm just trying to leave them a good review. But maybe it will help you if you're trying to make a decision for a Sunday midday class.\n\n I hope Alexis' classes continue and grow here (in addition to Sundays, I mean).", "date": "2012-07-15 19:55:20"}, {"_key": "3542032", "_id": "reviews/3542032", "_rev": "_fNy0V4S--L", "review_id": "RAu4J1tSOzNlIursz5ZrGw", "user_id": "0G-QF457q_0Z_jKqh6xWiA", "business_id": "DH_aRlDhnzsJTh1ffWwt_Q", "stars": 5, "useful": 15, "funny": 5, "cool": 11, "text": "Supergirl back to report on the expansion of Superfood Bar!

We grabbed a good spot behind the police barricades on the neutral ground across from the park and settled in. The parade started on time and everyone was just so awesome in our area, between the humans and the cutest dogs ever. I had my fill of puppy eye candy and was in a good mood for entire duration of my time here. I don't think I've ever cooed and cawed and eeeeeeee'd so much in a single day, just sayin'.

So cute they have to be illegal. Also, little Miss Smushface, our Yelp mascot, was all dressed up like a vegas showgirl with a feather headpiece and all. Loved all the rescue groups marching in this parade with the dogs wearing their \"adopt me\" coats. Yes, I want to adopt them all. Yet again, I'm reminded of my aspirations to own a farm one day so that I can have as many dogs, cats and ducks (I talked to someone yesterday who told me about her pet ducks and now I want some) and maybe even peacocks and a serval or two. \n\nWhile only my second parade to date, I think this is going to be my favorite.

In fact, this may be a first for me: five stars for an airport?! Yes, it's true. I actually look forward to landing and taking off from here.\n\nFirst and foremost, they've got the right way to welcome you to Music City. As in the presences of actual, live music! I've witnessed a variety of singer/songwriters and small bands and it may not always be my cup of tea, but it just feels right and gets you excited to be here. \n\nThe fun stuff: There's a good variety of eateries and shops for a small airport. Louis Armstrong International could stand to learn a thing or two from Nashville, as this airport has it going on. It's been modernized, at the very least to the point where you don't squint your eyes and wonder if you've traveled back to the 1980s. There's rocking chairs by baggage. Plenty of coffee options (crucial. If chains have to be at airports, and I know they do, at least give us more than shitty drip coffee. If this means Starbucks, I'm OK with that). I love those Benefit vending machines (kinda pure genius if you ask me. I've seen them in several airports now). There's plenty of comfy seating with outlets (at the Southwest gates at least).  Heck, there's even an area for parents to bring their restless children so they don't make the rest of us suffer (on that note, I wonder why airports don't consider putting in a gym with treadmills and weights for us restless adults?! And, like, punching bags even. Just an idea.)\n\nThe nitty gritty: I've never seen crazy lines at check-in or security. Getting baggage is a breeze and it's a pretty short walk to find a cab from there (go down the escalator, but if you have a ton of luggage, never fear, there's *actual signage* pointing out the elevators). Everyone's pretty friendly and helpful.\n\nReally, I don't know what more you could ask for in an airport that's not a major hub!

There is a variety of sausage, which I'm not really going to tell you much about since I'm a vegetarian, but if they are as good at tubed meats as they are at pies... There are cocktails. Those, of course, I can tell you about. Oh, delicious, unique cocktails. They infuse their own vodka! My favorite is the pear lemonade, just right for the warm day.

I've eaten in great places, really, I have, but Commander's is in a league of its - nay, her own. Think of her as the mother ship. It's wonderful to see a place live up to each and every expectation. True, I write this in a #CPC (Commander's Palace Coma), but I think you can trust me by now.\n \nIn cities like New York, where I'm from, there are dozens of truly great restaurants. The old guard. The new guard. You'd think never the twain shall meet but they do in New Orleans at Commander's Palace. I came here for the first time for my friend's birthday last night. We were a group of 5. I could just as easily see me bringing my \"One if by land, Two if by Sea\"-adoring parents here for our special NOLA restaurant occasion. They will love it. This is the thing: everyone is made to feel welcome here. I waltzed in with dozens of tattoos visible. I was greeted by at least half a dozen people. It didn't feel false. Whomever is in charge of FOH here should make the standard for others to live by! Thank you for making me feel at home, CP.\n\nSo, the food. Wow. Delicious. What with the chef having just won a James Beard award, so you don't need me telling you that. Vegetarians, there is an incredible risotto here. I love any risotto, but what makes it different here is that they add a lot of green vegetables to it (peas, asparagus...) and as delicious and decadent as it seems, it didn't feel as heavy, ie artery-cloggin', as most risotto often can. As in, I was able to order dessert, that bread pudding, in fact. *That* bread pudding. And although bread pudding can also be a very ponderous (yet sweet and delicious) affair, Commander's makes theirs into a sensational souffl\u00e9, so that the initial bites are light and airy and heavenly, but you dig down a bit more and get to the \"meat\" of it, a not-terribly-sweet bread pudding. It's DIEvine. \n\nAnd then there was the complimentary Sidecar shots served to our table. Delectable enough to sip. I wasn't going to shoot that back, oh hell no.\n\nYeah, yeah Commander's has almost a thousand 5 star reviews, but I wanna say my piece!!! I love writing 5-star reviews.

Sometimes I fear I'm downright surly.\n\nThis is all to say... I stress out before coming in most Lush stores and this one is no exception. I kind of like to be left alone when I'm shopping and sniffing and reading and that is just NEVER going to happen here. Accept it and move on, I guess. \n\nI love Lush products long time. Almost twenty years, in fact. I remember that first Lush shop I came upon on Kings Road in London (rather, I smelled it first. Heavenly!)

Their shower gels are my absolute favorite. When I'm in need of a little something something extra, I get one of the Shower Smoothies (the creamed almond and coconut definitely smells good enough to eat. OK so I tasted it once. Don't judge. I know I'm not the only one). \n\nThere are some product misses, don't get me wrong. The Angels on Bare Skin face mask, for example. It feels like barely moistened sandpaper.

I might have been funnier since), so I suggest you search my reviews and find it if you want to see me at my best. Or don't. The reality is, I love Lush. Their products are top notch, innovative, usually have catchy names, smell great and the list goes on. They are environmentally conscious. They are vegan conscious (for 20 years, so not due to any recent trend).

Yes, it's a wine shop, with a great selection of bottles (and quality affordable ones at that), but I like to order by the glass and enjoy the scene because there's always interesting conversation and meet-ups happening. It was a more quiet night, but there was a dog that we made friends with. I mean, he ran away from his people who were gathered at the long bar to sit on our laps! Never had that happen to me before, but there's the magic of Faubourg Wines. \n\nThere's always something delicious by the glass and it's only 5 bucks. Where are you going to get a deal like that in town? My first glass was a sparkling red, similar to a dry Lambrusco. Apparently it was a rare bottle and sorry to say, that they are probably not getting more of it. I like that it makes things seem extra special. And anyway, you can follow that glass up with another excellent $5 red, white or sparkling. \n\nI cannot believe it's been 7 lucky years since they've opened shop on a sleepy block of St. Claude, but it's such a vital place in the neighborhood. I'm a forever fan.", "date": "2019-03-15 16:26:48"}, {"_key": "3770553", "_id": "reviews/3770553", "_rev": "_fNy0c3O--h", "review_id": "zllmOYzNF_PSpRUWzubOaQ", "user_id": "0G-QF457q_0Z_jKqh6xWiA", "business_id": "AvYzDybffU77KZdXZbTOXA", "stars": 4, "useful": 15, "funny": 4, "cool": 10, "text": "When I was driving past their new location on St. Claude I could hardly believe it! \"Fair Grinds moved from the Fairgrounds to St. Claude?!\" No, even better, it's their new, second location.\n\nAnd I love it. Another coffee option that's within walking distance. The new location has plenty of outdoor seating in the alleyway leading up to the shop, which is smallish, but there's a fair amount of seating and outlets inside, too.\n\nAs you may or may not know, Fair Grinds has a mission behind their coffee (fair trade, locally sourced baked goods - didn't see any vegan treats, but hopefully they'll add some). The iced coffee is cold drip and that's just what I needed on a recent steamy Saturday. Oh and a really nice barista serving up the brews. \n\nI suspect I'll be a regular quite soon. Although I'm more of a grab & go kinda gal, I also have been known to set up shop and work for a couple hours in local coffee shops in town.

Granted, that is a fairly low bar (seeing as how this is just a sad little town* filled with Phillies fans and worse, Eagles fans), but Zahav easily met and obliterated the outsized expectations. \n\nThere were eight of us, and we decided to spring for the Taste of Zahav. With 16 mezze and 8 al ha'esh (skewers) to choose from, we quite literally ate everything the menu had to offer, and a few things that it didn't.** And I loved every single bite.\n\nFrom the colorful and gorgeous Salatim plates (think the Israeli version of banchan) through the surprisingly fantastic and varied desserts, Zahav maintains a level of quality that is astonishing. I'm not going to lead you through each item, but just call out a few of my favorite things:\n\n1. The warm, Turkish hummus paired with their impossibly fluffy laffa was the best of the hummus. Not just their hummus. I mean it is the best of all the hummuses (hummusi?) in the world. \n\n2. The fried cauliflower is as good as any vegetable has any right to be.\n\n3. Anything where beets is involved. \n\n4. Of course, the grilled haloumi. As with all haloumi, eat it quickly. And rejoice.\n\n5. The wine pairing. Not just perfect pairings, but an incredible value as well. I would certainly choose this over cocktails on a return trip. \n\n6. The sirloin shishlik. It will make a believer out of vegetarians, and it will make the meal for anyone hesitant about eating things they've never heard of (it's a steak skewer, people).\n\n7. The lamb tartare in lettuce wraps is ridiculous. Order this. \n\nSpeaking of lamb tartare, Zahav has an uncanny ability to take dishes that may sound unappetizing to your average diner, and turn your preconceived notions on your head. Duck hearts, lamb tongue...even if you're a little hesitant, give them a shot and you'll realize that this kitchen could make anything taste delicious.\n\nAnd therein lies my only issue with the meal I had at Zahav: I wanted to taste everything, and everything tasted fantastic.\n\nI realize that this doesn't sound like a problem, but prior to our meal, we spent the balance of the day drinking and eating (as usual). However, the Taste of Zahav is surprisingly affordable, so we assumed that it wouldn't be too large a meal and that we could handle it. This was a serious miscalculation. By the time dessert rolled around, I was simultaneously doing my best to take at least one bite of everything, and also trying not to die. My stomach just quit on me.\n\nAbout twelve hours after we ate dessert, I finally felt like I could take another bite of food.

The satay was juicy and flavorful with a great peanut dipping sauce, and the curry was very solid although it wasn't very spicy.  I also had a few bites of the triple flavor tilapia in the sweet and sour sauce, and really like the crispy, pan-seared fillet combined with the garlicky sauce.  Will definitely have to get this next time.  Most restaurants like to fry the fillet when they make a sweet and sour dish but pan searing actually brings out the flavor more and gives that delicious crispy exterior without killing your arteries.  We finished off with the mango sticky rice and coconut rice pudding.  While the mango sticky rice was very good, I liked the coconut rice pudding more because I love all things coconut and this was a delicious coconut-based concoction.  If you are in the area this week, and need to grab a bite, definitely stop in for the $15 dining days special.  It's a great deal and the food is very good.  They also have homemade beef jerky at $6/order, which I couldn't resist getting to-go; while it wasn't as fantastic as my aunt's homemade jerky, the meat was very well-marinated and flavorful and great paired with the accompanying chili paste.

Sweet osmanthus and sesame mochi dumpling soup: This was perfectly light, sweet, and refreshing with thin shreds of osmanthus and egg whites.  The dumplings were fluffy and filled with sesame.  They are smaller than normal but each was  perfectly balanced bite of filling to shell.\n2. Crabmeat and pork soup dumplings: These were kind of meh with a thick shell and barely any soup and filling.  Maybe it was an off-day but I would suggest the other pan-fried options instead.\n3. Pan Fried buns: These were better than the soup dumplings but the filling was pretty sparse and definitely could have been more generous in portion.  4. Pan fried dumplings: These were solid with a plump, juicy filling and nicely crispy pan fried shell.\n5. Chive buns: Nice nd crispy with a flavorful egg and chive filling.  The only thing that would have made them better would have been some vemicelli inside but pretty solid overall.\n6. Stir-fried clams: Pretty flavorful clams albeit small ones.  It's a bit on the salty side but still pretty solid.\n7. Plum spare ribs: Fried sweet spareribs with sweet plums.  Overall, a nice appetizer-sized option (the ribs are small).  The meat is flavorful and pretty tender but the dish itself is not very filling so this is more of a starter vs an actual main entree.\n8. Seafood tofu casserole: Mostly light silkn tofu with 3 prawns, some fishballs, and 3 pieces of surimi.  This is very light but the seafood portion was tiny.  The nice part is that it isn't oily at all but it's definitely not your traditional seafood hot pot.\n9. Seafood udon: Stir fried udon with seafood in a traditional brown oyster-soy.  This was pretty standard but it was branded as a Shanghai stir fried thick noodle and it resembled more of a Japanese stir-fried udon.  It was just okay but a bit salty.\n10. Marinated sliced roast beef: This was just okay.  The beef was tender but slightly dry and didn't have that sweet and savaory marinade that is the hallmark of the 5-spice Shanghainese beef.\n11. Seasonal stir-fried vegetables: This was light and refeshing and surprisngly one of the best dishes with sliced lotus, cauliflower, broccoli, snow peas, mushrooms, woodear, carrots, and asparagus.  There was just a very slight coagulation of the corn starch thickener on some pieces but they were very busy tonight and likely understaffed in the kitchen so they were likely making this in a rush.", "date": "2021-05-31 03:45:43"}, {"_key": "2395362", "_id": "reviews/2395362", "_rev": "_fNyzYxq--D", "review_id": "--69QUGXxKAuu5iWGgA7NA", "user_id": "ouODopBKF3AqfCkuQEnrDg", "business_id": "2XYPFRm7teCUr3eGsB2-qw", "stars": 4, "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "text": "I love this restaurant that is just a hop and a skip away from mis padres.

She was very patronizing when I inquired about how big the turkey and chicken entree salads were.  \"It's a salad.  It's lettuce.\"  Well, geez that was super helpful.  Thanks a million for letting me that a salad contains lettuce.  Anyhow, I decided on the grilled chicken tenderloins country dinner plate, which contained 4 TINY pieces of chicken.  They were tender but  wouldn't have satisfied a toddler!  The turnip greens were very good, though, as were the carrots.  My dad's hamburger wasn't that great and tasted like something from a fast food restaurant, although the turkey noodle was decent.  Now, since the actual entree was so tiny, I expected to be brought more than a single corn muffin and a single biscuit, but that was all.  Our server actually ignored us throughout the meal and we had to ask for refills, which she did bring albeit with exaggerated eye rolls.

The food was pretty standard for the chain, and I did like that I was able to place my order online, pay for it in advance, and park right outside the takeout register and have my food practically delivered to me in minutes, complete with utensils, napkins, and fortune cookies.  Yes, I do realize that my laziness is almost sloth-like but c'est la vie.  I noticed that they have a few new menu items, like the crabmeat fried rice, pad thai, and a duck duo, so I ventured to try the duck, which had a slow cooked leg and a cripsy pan-fried breast served with a watercress salad.  The duck was just okay and the portion was a bit on the small side, but that may be a good thing considering that duck isn't exactly the most cholesterol-friendly poultry meat.  I liked the slow cooked leg more than the breast since the flavor was icily imbued throughout, whereas the breast was a bit bland in the innermost section.  It wasn't bad for a chain but I would definitely get my duck fix at Margaret Kuo, Sangkee, or New East.  The Shanghai shrimp dish was very solid, with tender shrimp, plenty of veggies, and a light yet flavorful garlic sauce.  Definitely better than what you would get from your typical greasy takeout place.  The crab fried rice was pretty good, and it had pieces of bacon, which definitely gave it a bit of a twist.  The actual amount of crabmeat was skimpy but that was to be expected.  The flavor was good, and I was glad to see egg and shitake slices in it; overall, I did like it a lot better than what Dad would usually get from China (insert noun here).  It came to about $37 for all 3, which wasn't bad at all.  Next time, I will probably go back to my usual Singapore street noodles, moo goo gai pan, and cumin lamb, but it was a nice change tonight and a good break from cooking.

I had the chicken with cashews, which came with a very generous serving of chicken and cashews; the sauce was flavorful yet not oily at all.  They also used chicken chunks rather than slices, which was a nice plus.  Dad liked his doubled-cooked shredded pork with five spice tofu, but did comment that E Mei's version is more flavorful; I tasted a bite and found the actual pork to be a bit tough and the tofu a bit bland, although it was certainly better than anything that we would have gotten from any other Chinese place in KoP.  We also got an order of the spicy shredded beef with peppers.  This was good, but there were only a few shreds of peppers.  I'm not complaining, though, since they compensated for the lack of peppers with a plethora of meat.  It came to about $30, for all three, which isn't bad.  the lunch specials are around $8 each, and come with soup.  I highly advise getting the wonton soup.
