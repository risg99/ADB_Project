I got a message from the owner saying he'd like to have me come in to receive a FREE service because they previously ruined my hair. So, I thought since he's the owner my hair would turn out good but I was wrong. I'm really unhappy with this whole experience. I showed him multiple photos on google of what I wanted done to my hair which was a lot of blonde. I told him I do not want any ORANGE in my hair as I wanted a \"white blonde\". He said you won't have any orange in your hair. I have a message from him the OWNER saying I would receive a FREE service if I deleted my previous review. He should of NEVER offered a free service if it wasn't really free! So, I said how much because I thought I was getting my hair done for free. He said since your hair is long and thick you'll have to pay for the hair color and \"medicine\" but he won't charge me for his time. I said ok how much he said $80. He said it would cost me $180 if he didn't give me a discount which is very pricey. He put a lot of highlights on my hair and worked quickly as he seemed to want to rush on my hair which I do not like. My hair is important to me, I don't want my hair to fall out. He said this medicine he's gonna put on my hair is $50 for a treatment and that I needed it because of the blonde going on my hair which I know any coloring is damaging and blonde is very damaging but he said he charges everyone who gets hair color for this so called medicine which they mix into the color you dye your hair. You can purchase the entire set online (3 bottles) for $75 which is supposed to give you like 15 applications so he's definitely charging a lot of money! He only put No.1 on my hair and not No.2 or No.3. He also had a lady (the receptionist) wash out my hair? Ok, even though she was nice why would he have her do that when she said she knows nothing about hair because I asked if she's styling my hair and she said she doesn't do hair and I wouldn't want her to do my hair. As I was waiting there was a lady next to me, she got her hair cut and a perm. She was done but she wasn't happy, she told the lady she didn't like the hair cut and she had her style it more and trim off a little more but the lady still wasn't happy. The girl told the client when she washes her hair it will be better.. um how? I know she left very unhappy! Also the lady behind me was getting her hair cut and when he (the owner) was done cutting her hair she looked in the mirror and wanted it different and styled different so that made me have to wait longer but 2 clients were not happy and also myself. That's not a good look TJ nail and spa! I had a towel on my head and waited about 30 mins just to get my hair blow dried because he was cutting another clients hair. I seen orange roots, I was mad!!! He finally came over and I said I don't like the orange color on my roots, can you put a toner on my hair and he said it's not orange it's the lighting. The lighting?! It wasn't the lighting! He proceeds to blow dry hair and then starts straighten it without asking me if I wanted it straightened or curled, you are supposed to pick how you want your hair styled. At that point I knew my hair wasn't what I wanted and it wasn't gonna be fixed even if I wanted it too. I just sat there in the hair, mad and yet again very disappointed! I looked in the mirror and seen my hair damaged and brittle, orange and brassy and not even close to what I wanted. There goes my money down the drain, yet again. I will not be back to get my hair ruined and he made me delete my previous review which was also 0-1 stars before I left his salon but I had to write this one, this is real, this is honest, beware of getting your hair completely ruined and nothing close to what you want! Like I said I showed the OWNER multiple photos and I stated I did NOT want any orange on my hair but I did have orange on my hair, I didn't get what I wanted like he said, he said he doesn't mess up, he's been doing hair for years. As a salon owner I think he should take the time to really do what the client wants and achieve what the client wants done to their hair, if the workersowner would do that then there shouldn't be any bad reviews but there is so that shows you they do not care, not even the owner cares. They just want to rush and get done to get paid, they don't care if the customer is happy or not. There are more bad reviews from people going to this salon and having horrible experiences but he is bribing people to delete their bad reviews because he told me the bad reviews is hurting his business which is why people do reviews, to let people know this place is awesome or this place is horrible, beware, stay away. I do reviews to let people know the good, the bad and the ugly. I do reviews anywhere and I'm always 100% honest.

I drive 10 minutes back and get my remade order and another apology.

I am not the type to complain, but I have been here twice and both times I have had terrible service at the bar. The first bartender served me but acted as if I was bothering him.  This second time, with a completely different bartender mind you, it was worse. I am not dressed like a street person or anything, and I am not pan-handling. But you would think that I was the way he acted. First, I sit at the bar and I am waiting for service. So, the bartender walks by me, pours a glass a water, turns in front of me, puts the water down, gives me some stupid half-grin then walks off. Not one audible word of greeting or a grunt passed between his lips. Then, he gets a menu, drops that down and walks off again! Not a sound. Is it me, but when a customer enters an eating establishment, shouldn't they be greeted in some manner?  Not looked at like \"why are you here. I have better things to do\"?  I am not looking for a royal salute or anything. Just \"Hey man, what can I get ya?\"  or something to that affect.   Anyway, I start to look at the drink and food menus. Then, a group of anywhere from 10-15 people come in behind me and say, to what looked like a manager, \"We don't want to eat, is it ok if we just have a few drinks at the bar?\". The manager says \"Sure.\" The guy then says, \"Can we get few beers down here\"? (paraphrasing). The bartender says \"Sure!\" and proceed to service this group, one-by-one, as they order drinks. Ok, fine technically, I was looking at the menu when this started. But still, he walked back and forth, right in front of me, for about 10-12 minutes. Not once did he say, \"Hey, just shout and I will get you something\", or \"Hey man, just give me a few minutes and I will be right with you\". Nothing!  It was obvious it was a big group, but I mean, he gave no acknowledgement to the fact that I was sitting there waiting! \n\nLong story short - after this 10-12 minutes of waiting, I just walked out and went somewhere else.

I went there yesterday with a girlfriend to order a drink while waiting on a friend. The bartender (Megan) was rude, unprofessional, and unpleasant. My friend ordered a French 45 and I ordered one of the \"Favorites\" the Pimm's Cup. \n\nWe both disliked our drinks very much. I'm not sure what went wrong, but they just weren't very good. We let Megan know that we disliked the drinks and she says \"what's wrong them?\" We tell her that they both just taste bad. She then says \"well I made them the exact way the menu says\" \n\nThen she sticks a straw in one of the drinks and says \"that taste like it's suppose to\" Then she says \"since I already made the drinks, you'll have to pay for them\" \n\nThis is completely unacceptable and poor customer service. If a guest orders anything that they dislike, the right thing to do is ask what would they like instead. I work in the restaurant industry and so does my friend who was with me. So we know true hospitality and what Megan said was the opposite.\nI ask to speak with the manager. Megan tells me that the manager isn't in until 5pm (it's almost 2pm at this point)\n\nMegan then says, \"I've worked here for 6 years so I know what I'm doing and what I'm talking about\" I then ask for the hotel manager. Megan says \"I'll get you something else and you just pay for the original two drinks that you disliked. \n\nWhy on earth would we pay for the original two drinks in lieu of new ones? Why wouldn't she just comp the drinks, or void them, or separate them off for the manager to come later on? So I ask her those questions and she says she didn't have the authority to comp or void anything. \n\nNeedless to say, we paid and left.

Based on the menu, this establishment seems to pride itself on the brisket. I had the tacos and my wife had the brisket platter. The tacos come on deep fried corn tortillas, which you have two break in half in order to fold, effectively making it more of  a sandwich. The brisket was wholly inedible and flavorless. The fat overwhelmed the taco, and not the good, melt in your mouth fat, but the chewy, gristly fat. My wife's sliced brisket was no better. No juice , no smoke ring, no flavor. I left two of the three tacos on the plate and pushed it to the side. The waitress came by and took the plate with no inquiry as to why I wasn't eating them. We also ordered \"the best Mac and cheese from any Brentwood smokehouse\" or something to that effect for the kids, and it was clearly shells and cheese from a box. Not only was it completely uninteresting, but it was $5.50 per kid, served with toast and no drink included. We ordered kids lemonades that were $2.50 each, although that price was not listed on the kids menu. Once the check came with everything included, I told the waitress I was surprised she was charging me for the brisket and she asked \"why?\" When I explained, she said \"ok I'll tell them\". In the 5-10 minutes before we left, 'them' did nothing and I ended up paying $70 for a pitiful attempt at barbecue. If you want the real deal, you won't find it in Brentwood.

The food has severely gone downhill in not only quality of ingredients but also in ability to prepare a dish. I ate here for lunch today, saying that so hopefully a member of the staff reads this and remembers me, I ordered the dry hot pot and my gf ordered fried dumplings and the cold noodles with chili oil and we shared each other's food. The mushrooms in my dish were impossible to cut even with a knife and the rest of the vegetables had a freeze dried feel to them being the consistency of bark. The pork was a bit rubbery and only had flavor from the oil draped over everything that seemed under seasoned as well and definitely tasted old. This was labeled in the menu as a 10/10 spicy rating, it was at most a 2. I didn't bother saying anything because of how rude the waiter/host was, but I'll get to that. The rice was cold and clumped together in chunks that led me to understand that it was previously microwaved. The dumplings looked ok, but the dough was undercooked and the sauce was just soy sauce that had no care whatsoever put into it. Her noodles were very bland and whoever prepared them obviously doesn't care about their food. The noodles had the same flavor deprived oil from my dish in it, just disappointing really. This type of food is supposed to be robust and I've eaten at a ton of places across the country and internationally that do care about what the put out. This place doesn't care anymore. The man that seated us was incredibly rude the entire time. He huffed and puffed and stomped his feet when I asked for the real Chinese menu instead of the Americanized Chinese menu. And, they used to throw shade if you asked for the Americanized menu, now it's the opposite. After we were done we both had a decent amount of food left and I decided to take it to feed to the raccoons that come around my house. They look cool and I like to feed them. Anyway, the take out container was dirty from previous food in it! I was blown away, especially when I pointed it out and the rude person pretending to be a man grabbed it out of my hand and stormed, literally stormed off before I was even half way through my sentence. I was calm the whole time, not sure what this guys deal is. Then came back with the same container that he washed! He washed the dirty container that should never have been used in the first place and thought that was acceptable. I will never go here again and I hope they go out of business so no one has to be punished by this Handy Nasty food. Disgusting food and disgusting people, except for the one guy who worked there who said goodbye to us.

We were visiting Nashville and an internet search for restaurants showed this was one of the places to go to in Nashville.  We went for brunch.  I had a good feeling when we first when in and Zeppelins Over the Hills and Far Away was playing but that was probably the most memorable thing.  We didn't start off with the whippped feta, which seems to be the big thing there, maybe that's why we didn't have the same experience as other people.  I ordered the French toast cinnabon thing which was fine.  My wife however, had the Shakshuka and did not like it at all.  Too spicy in the morning, and as someone mentioned in another review, it would have been nice if that was mentioned (although it does say spicy on the menu, I think she was expecting a different spice).  Also, the poached egg to me was disgusting.  My wife used a spoon but could have drank it with a straw.  I think there were two, I give her credit for forcing down one, I couldn't have done it.  We also ordered a bloody mary  and a mimosa.  There wasn't much mimosa as far as volume goes and my bloody mary was a little thick, I think because of olive juice.  We each had side orders of bacon, two slices each at $5, and not like it was super thick.  Overall, the bill was about $80 and my wife was still hungry.  The waitress did notice that my wife hardly ate anything and mentioned getting the whipped feta saying it would help her stomach which was now hurting because of the spice.  She said no, but it would have been nice if the waitress had brought over a sample.  Anyway, like I said, about $80; $10 each for the mimosa and bloody mary, $14 for the three cinnabon french toast, $13 for the Shakshuka, $10 for four slices of bacon and whatever it was for the coffee (which was good).  I'm counting the tip so the coffee must have been up there too as well as the extra pita my wife asked for.  Listen, The Olive Tree Cafe in the Village in NYC has been there forever.  Check out their menu online and check out their prices.  They don't do breakfast, but if you're ever in NYC and get a chance to go there, do it.

I now work with disabled persons trying to help them find employment. We're not supposed to meet them in their home as per company policy. My client, who is disabled, and I have visited this pizzeria a few times per her request because it's close to her house and she feels comfortable meeting there. Today we went in at 1:45pm and I noticed it was busier than usual (typically we go at a time where it is not busy restaurant hours.) Before going to sit down like we normally do, and again this was only our third time here, We were greeted aggressively and immediately by who I assume is the owner. I started to ask \"do you mind if we sit here..\" and was cut off. He said, \"I have a real problem with you coming in here not buying anything and sitting taking up a table for 2-3 hours.\" (Mind you, we have never been there the previous 2 times over an hour and 15 minutes - as I have a limited amount of time I am able to work with each client.  There also has been about 15 other open tables in the restaurant each time we were there, including today.) This person responded very hostile and aggressive. Had the gentleman asked politely if I purchased a drink or a slice of pizza we could sit and go about our business, however he met me with an extremely volatile attitude and aggressive choice of words. Again, as someone who's worked in the food industry, I understand how it can be frustrating for someone to come in and sit without purchasing anything. With that said, how this employee decided to treat me in this moment made me and my disabled client extremely uncomfortable. The rudeness was completely unnecessary and being familiar with the industry I wouldn't have minded at all purchasing something from this place in order to sit there for an hour, had I been spoken to appropriately. The part I feel the worst about is how my client was treated. I had to explain to her why \"that man was so rude\". It's unacceptable how me and my client were made to feel today. She's already treated differently in the world and she felt terrible after this interaction. I'm mortified that this had to happen in this way, and this whole situation could have been completely avoided had we been treated like human beings. What the employee was trying to say was completely justified, however we were yelled at and made to feel like we were unwelcome for no reason whatsoever. I will not be entering this restaurant again for obvious reasons, and I encourage anyone who has any empathy for disabled persons to do the same.

I currently live in the Pittsburgh area.  So when I am home, I love coming to Collingswood for some delicious eats.  I had a positive experience the last time I was at Sabrina and was hoping to create more since I was asking my friends to be in my bridal party.\n\nThere are no reservations for brunch on Sabrina's on the weekend but they will accept at least a 30-45 min call aheads for a party.  My friend did a call ahead for ten am. My friends tend to struggle with being on time and there is a policy that everyone has to be there to be seated.  The policy makes sense and I was open to the hostess that we were at fault for not all being there.   My friends didn't all show up until 10:40.\n\nThere was no table available which was fine since we were late.  But I was not okay with the hostess rudeness towards us.  She told us that we never did the call ahead despite the verified text from the restaurant saying we called ahead on my friend's phone.  We let that comment go since we were taking ownership that we were not all there on time.  She told us that the wait would be about 30-45 minutes and they will text us when the table is open.  She told us to go walk around since there was a farmers market happening close by the restaurant.  She also reminded us that the whole party had to be here.  I don't mind the reminder but again her tone was rude towards us.  We let it go again because we were at fault for our struggle with timeliness. \n\nWe take a walk and about ten minutes later we get a text that the table is ready.  We get back quickly and wait in line since there was people checking in/getting seated in front of us.  When it is our turn, the hostess tells us we missed our five minute mark and the wait was going to be a 15-30 minute wait.  Again her tone was rude and this time we were not at fault.  Her time said we arrived there six minutes after the text.  Okay this means... we were on time but we waited patiently in line for people in front of us to check in/be seated.  Which means the hostess did not wait and sat people at our table. \n\nI initially was going to let it go but her rudeness was leaving not a good feeling.  My friend argues with her because it was not fair we were being blamed for something that was her fault this time.  Also she told us to go for a walk since the wait was going to be 30-45 minutes?!\n\nThe arguing was not worth it and I told my friends we were leaving.  We went to the tortilla press across the street.  It was a great decision, since the food was super delicious and the customer service was much more friendlier towards us.", "date": "2018-07-08 12:38:32"}, {"_key": "1796797", "_id": "reviews/1796797", "_rev": "_fNyy1Pe---", "review_id": "G-9HEqjSyEr98dETTEF6Ig", "user_id": "eAP28rTY05l-JdKlVxHW3A", "business_id": "oCbJpGl8IkH1WdYa25TDBA", "stars": 1, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "The waitstaff were attentive and very nice!

Not sure how an Italian restaurant can run out of their home made bread, especially when the place was dead. In the middle of ordering the appetizer our waitress just walked away pretending not to hear us. She did that a couple more times when we asked for a few more things for the table like steak sauce and lemons. I would NOT recommend the calamari, it came out shriveled up and dry. It took the waitress another 15 minutes to realize everyone's drinks at the table were empty before we had to flag her down to grab us all refills.

No \"here you go\" or smile on her face. \n\nMeanwhile, a gentleman\u200b came and offered us food that we never ordered... guess he meant to go to a different table. \n\nWhen our appetizers\u200b came, another woman yelled out \"avocado rolls\" *doesn't wait for anyone to claim them, she just puts them on the table* \"Shrimp roll\" *slides on table*, \"Shrimp\u200b and pork roll\" *slides on table* and then 1 of 3 drinks arrives and it just go slam dab in the middle of the table with no regard\u200b as to who ordered it.

Every aspect of the stay was great, especially the staff and food at the Market Table breakfast, up until the very end. \n\nMy company covered the cost of parking in the garage for the first few nights. After which, we could either park across the street or pay out of pocket to continue parking in the garage. I elected to remain in the garage. Apparently, the monthly garage parking fees cannot be pro-rated. Meaning if you stay in the garage May 31st through July 1st you are going to be charged for 3 months, rather than the 1 month you actually stayed there. My situation was similar. My company covered the costs up until May 30th, and I parked in the garage May 31st through mid-August. So, to my surprise, as I was preparing to check out, I was slapped with a $700 ($175/month) parking bill. Despite the fact I elected to be billed monthly. I didn't even try to dispute the last 2 weeks of August that I'm being charged for. But charging a full month for 1 day in May, where is the customer service aspect in that? Especially considering my vehicle was broken into and cost me upwards of $800 to get the window repaired and replace the lost items. To add insult to injury, I was told on two separate occasions that due to my misfortune in their garage (the break in) they would take care of the parking fee for me. Which would have been an incredible act of good faith. However, I guess the staff wasn't on the same page, because I still ended up paying the whole amount.\n\nAs I said, outside of this situation, the staff and service were amazing.

She never apologized that it was busy and that our food took so long. She did ask the four guys behind us many times, and I even heard her say they were getting 16 oz beers for the price of a 9 oz.

It's taken me a while to write this review but it still bothers me what happened. I booked Adina to do my bridal hair for my wedding about a year and a half ago. Things seemed to be going good, did a couple trials to get the style I wanted, then 2 weeks before my wedding Adina contacts me via Facebook to tell me she double booked and had to cancel my bridal hair. When I responded completely freaking out, she took a long time to respond to me, leaving me in a panic. When she finally responded she said she was trying to find me a replacement stylist. I don't know how you make such a big mistake to double book the most important day of a women's life but to also not realize it until 2 weeks before the big day. There I was 2 weeks before my wedding having to frantically somehow do the nearly impossible of finding a stylist on extremely short notice for wedding day bridal hair. Although I did manage to find someone, we didn't have time to do a trial and although the new stylist did her best, my hair didn't look how I wanted it on my wedding day. Friends and family tell me they think because I only booked her to do my hair and not my entire bridal party, she got an offer to do a bridal party that day and thought of an excuse to cancel mine. I'm sure Adina will deny this accusation which I don't know to be the case or not and honestly I don't care what the reason why, there's no excuse for what she did.

I ended up abruptly moving to NYC and needing a new phone number and assumed my membership cancelled when I never received an email from the spa. I called the Marlton location while in town on business and asked if those credits would transfer, to which they told me yes. I booked a facial and a massage a week in advance. I left both my phone number and email and when I received a confirmation email about the appointment I assumed all must have been well. I arrived early to my appointment to ensure that my credits were still okay to be used. The receptionist said she had to call Morristown, but did not stop me from going into either my facial OR massage. \n\nThe esthetician, Karen, was incredibly friendly and had a gentle touch. I wish she had done more extractions and really gone to work on my face. I appreciate the gentle-ness, but there's always a painful time during facials that you just have to grin and bear for better results, and I was hoping for more of that. Otherwise, I thought Karen was lovely. I was dismayed that between my facial and my massage there weren't any robes to transfer between rooms, so I got dressed and waited for about ten minutes while Karen tried to find my massage therapist, and then while she turned the room over until he came to get me. \n\nMy massage therapist asked about my concerns and then left  me to change. By the time we started the massage it was already about 2:15. He was good about asking me how the pressure was, but I felt like I've gotten better massages from an airport chair massage. He used a lot of forearm, and little else technique wise. The massage was not thorough in the slightest. No scalp massage, no middle back, parts of my arms and legs were barely covered. I've had enough fifty minute massages to know that this was lacking. The massage ended at 2:50, not even close to fifty minutes (nor sixty if you're counting the ten minute changing time). After I got dressed my massage therapist was outside with a bottle of water, but he did not walk me out the door. He said goodbye in the hallway and I was left wandering in circles (ended up in an employee break room!) before finding my way out front. \n\nWhen I went to check out I held my tongue on the massage because I figured I had paid for it a while ago, I would suck it up and chalk it up to a bad but free (minus tip) experience. I was then told by the receptionist that she had yet to get in touch with Morristown regarding my credits. I had a bad feeling about this. When she got ahold of them they told her the only way to access my credits was to have me sign up again. There is no hand and stone in or around New York City (where I live). I was NOT prepared to pay for two services, I would have never made the appointments, and I certainly would have cancelled them had I known the circumstances. I asked why this was not checked ahead of time,or even during my first appointment before I went into a SECOND appointment, and I didn't think it was fair what was happening. A manager was brought over who said she would take care of things and would give me a call before running my credit card (I wanted to leave my tip on it). I assumed she would call me to work out some sort of price. Which is when I would have addressed the poor massage situation. \n\nI checked my credit card today and they ran my credit card after the appointment without my permission. I am beyond furious and refuse to ever return to this location, and plan on telling everybody I know in the area to avoid it as well. This was an unacceptable situation and I hope that anybody reading this knows to make 100% sure their services are covered before going in.", "date": "2018-05-09 16:07:00"}, {"_key": "1803469", "_id": "reviews/1803469", "_rev": "_fNyy1k6--_", "review_id": "BeMl6TrjY18dxNDfMHlo9A", "user_id": "-BGjPtWM3Bz4g7L_kc2zuA", "business_id": "4-y4Jj8hNuVIFktoYnm3-Q", "stars": 1, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Ordered 2 pizzas for pick up.

It was supposed to be simple with slight scalloped edges on top. It was a disaster and looked so unprofessional everyone who has seen it couldn't believe that I paid money for it. We were going to stick the naked cake on top of another round, however all the round cakes came with a ring of buttercream roses on top. I was never told that there would be roses. Apparently this is their standard, but no one mentioned it to me, so how would I know it would be on there? Also when I stacked the cakes, the naked cake icing was a different color than the other two cakes. All the same icing, one super white and the other two were a yellow color. They tasted different and I know what the frosting should taste like since I had a sample of it before ordering. Obviously they messed up the icing on two of the cakes. Stephanie explained that they didn't know I would be stacking it so it didn't seem like it would matter. All the cakes were also supposed to be on cardboard that was cut to the size of the bottom of the cakes. Stephanie and I spoke about this on the phone and I emailed her a confirmation that this would be done. Naturally, they weren't cut so they stood out terribly on our cake base.

Guess they only know how to serve wine. \n\nFor entrees, I ordered the special, a dry aged New York strip, but it was totally overpowered by a thick pepper crust, which completely ruined the point of the dry aged flavors, for $60. To add insult, the steak knife was duller than  the butter knife, and I never had to work a knife that hard in a white linen.   The lobster tail for $26 was dried out and mediocre. The highlight of my wife's $50 salmon was the hollandaise sauce and side crab, the salmon itself was thin and uninteresting. \n\nWe opted for the chocolate lava cake for dessert, which was the only thing worthwhile. The dessert menu was boring steak house safe bets: lava cake, cheese cake, berries and cream, creme brulee. \n\nService was very good at least, although slow for being a quarter full on a Thursday night. \n\nOverall, a rather disappointing showing and it seems they have gone the way of Ruth Chris and outlived their Glory days. The dry aged steak dish was completely mis-designed and the menu is just as stereotypical unimaginative steak house as it gets. In hindsight, we probably could have had a far better, or at least similar experience, across the street for a hundred bucks less, not to mention whats available in half of downtown Indianapolis.

The only reason this place is still in business is because of the location. We were greeted upon arrival and sat quickly...nothing afterwards was quick. It took at least 15 minutes before for someone came to the table to greet us and ask what we wanted to drink. We ordered at that time as well since we had plenty of time to look at menus. I'm a mahi mahi fan so I ordered it as a sandwich and fried with cole slaw. I'll put it this way, I was so disappointed in it I left an entire piece (came with 2 decent sized cuts of mahi) but the breading was the worst I've ever had, the slaw was mayo based not vinegar based as the waitress stated, and it was possibly the most bland food I've ever had in my 38 years of existence. My friend had clam basket that was mostly fries and equally unimpressive. Son had spaghetti that he said tasted like nothing. Daughter had burger that she said tasted fine and she ate all of it. The waitress didn't seem to know much about anything she served and consistently gave two craps about who ordered what. She would bring out something we asked for and would hand it to someone else at the table. She seemed confused as hell. Long story short this place could have been in our building and I wouldn't eat here again. If you see this place full or a good review I guarantee it's from local clientele.

And the lobster tail was tough, dry and just gross.   I asked her for some ranch , butter; and lemon. So I could drown my food. Considering it was near closing I didn't want to ask for anything to be remade... however they could have offered us something off the bill.    By the time she came back with the sauce I asked for at least 10 mins had passed. My lobster was cold to the touch.  Oh on top of they didn't serve my mash potatoes until 10 mins after my entree.

First of all, the French toast is deep fried. Nothing in the description on the menu alluded to the fact that I would be served deep fried bread for breakfast. In what world does French toast = deep fried bread? It only tasted like oil, and when I poked the bread oil just oozed out. So essentially you're eating oil soaked bread for breakfast. Drowning it in syrup didn't help with the flavor either. \n\nThe omelet also came out and was clearly covered in oil. Surprise surprise, it also just tasted like oil. It was served with 2 cold pieces of toast.\n\nUnless you enjoy eating oil for breakfast, you're better off waiting in line at Fido or heading down the street to J Christopher's.

We REALLY wanted it to be our spot. Our normal spot Salty Rim Grill recently closed and we were looking for a new spot on the water to be our new regular go to. \n\nAt first this place had all the makings to be that spot. Beautiful view, food was really good, drinks were tasty. But the service. My god the service was sooo bad. We read a lot of reviews about how the service sucked but you never know maybe it's just one person right? Wrong. \n\nEVERYTHING took forever. From sitting down to being greeted, to getting the food, to getting more drinks, to trying to get our bill. Which btw we bought a voucher on Yelp which not only did the waitress not know how to do but neither did the manager. Oh yeah and it took 15 minutes for the manager to come out after the waitress said she had to get him for the voucher. Then I got the bill, it was wrong. We waited forever again and finally I went inside. I found the waitress and waited for her while she ignored me as she entered bills. Finally I get her attention and tell her the bill is wrong. She says to me \"did you tell your waitress?\" I go \"you were our waitress...\" wow.  Saw the manager again so flagged him down. He finally fixed it and I had a conversation with him. Told him about how the food was great and so was the view and we were hoping to make it our normal spot but the service was so bad we won't be coming back (did I mention there was almost no other customers in the place?) He said he appreciated the feedback but just made a bunch of excuses. New staff, he was in the kitchen, etc. listen it could just be an off day but he didn't even seem like he cared at all. Never tried to make it right. Nothing. \n\nSo there you have it. Like I said food was great, good view, they had a live band which was good. But horrible service is a deal breaker. We won't be back. Too bad, so much potential. But you HAVE to care about your customers.\n\nPS. Get some umbrellas on the patio so we don't have to melt in the sun.

Unless you happen to be a horse, or some other animal that enjoys a salt lick.  It was seriously gross.

Regardless, we have patronized this park numerous times and for it just being the 2nd year of operation, there have been several equipment failures. Seems like every time we visit, something is: \"broken & wont be in operation\" for either hours or, the entire day. Last Sunday the kiddie water park and the smaller tubes were out of commission so the only venue now is, the big swimming pool or, the Lazy river. After an hour, the lazy river looked like hundreds of refugees in floating ashore or one of those carnival duck games, you choose which. Now, the curious thing here is that you have a long wait in line only to be told AFTER YOU HAVE PAID ADMISSION that one of the pools or the lazy river is out of commission for the day. Nice huh? It's almost like they train their teenaged employees to \"get the cash first\" then let em' know the reality of the situation. The food is expensive & not terribly good. \nAll in all, the City of Greenwood is perpetuating a sort of highway robbery. We are seniors who do not live in Greenwood however, we pay a non resident seniors price, about $8 each..$2 more than Greenwood seniors because obviously, we must be more wealthy.

It is one of my favorite restaurants and I drove over half an hour to eat there with two of my friends on Thursday may 31st. Our servers were Tracey and mikayla, whose was training, and I was extremely disappointed in the service that we recieved.\nI'd like to highlight first the some service that met the outstanding expectations that I know olive garden expects.\nWhen we arrived we were seated right away and our server in training introduced herself fairly quickly. We were given adequate time to look at the menu and make our selections. Our first round of salad and bread sticks, along with our appetizer very quickly. After this though the whole atmosphere and attitude seemed to change.\nOur tray of breadsticks and salad stood empty for almost 20 minutes after that initial  round. One of the reasons I love olive garden is because of the refills on salad, soup, and breadsticks. While we waited on someone to recognize that we needed refills, a tray of dirty dishes sat out in the dining room for approximately 30 minutes across from our table. Our main courses came out before our second round of salad and breadsticks and when I recieved my entree the sauce in the ravioli de portabellas that I had ordered congealed and the entree was cold. I flagged down a server as no one had asked us how are meal was. Although my meal was replaced with no question, it came out after both of my friends were finished eating and had recieved to-go boxes, so I was eating my meal alone. After we were all done eating, everything was boxed up, and dishes were cleared we then waited over another 15 minutes for my dessert to-go and our check. Finally when we did receive our check it was the wrong one. Thankfully I was planning on paying with a credit card so I didn't just leave money on the table and walk out. \nAgain I am very disappointed in the service I recieved tonight. The problem with our service is that there was no direction from the server that was training the new employee. Tracey seemed to be more worried about a large party that was sitting behind us but made a point to mention in passing that mikayla better do good tonight because she was making her money. Now I understand the basis behind why trainees give their tips to their trainer, as I went through the training myself, but tracy was not guiding her, checking on the table or shadowing her anyway.

I visited the shop on 5/19/18, and this will be my last visit. I went there because I was hungry and in need of food, but it seemed like I walked into the middle of classic P.T. Barnum show: clowns juggling while riding unicycles and elephants parading around on their hind legs. The first employee I interacted with, at the \"bulk\" bagel counter, didn't hesitate to let me know that I was attempting to order from the wrong location. Fair enough. They did have a sign on the counter, but it wasn't as conspicuous as an \"order here\" sign that dangles from the ceiling. Her tone made it clear to me that I had already committed one transgression. I then order from the attendant at the POS. I clarified my complicated order of a breakfast sandwich and two toasted everything bagels with a tomato and garlic cream cheese, three times. The first clarification was that I wanted everything bagels, not plain. The second  clarification was directed toward me because they actually have garlic and herb cream cheese, not garlic cream cheese. The third was my reiteration of the tomato and the quantity of the said bagels. At this point I had more confidence in a drunk ESL Uber driver getting me home safely than my order being prepared as per my request. After waiting for my extravagant order to be prepared to imperfection and gazing at the yellow ceiling grid with stalactites of black dust, my name was called and the first employee I interacted with hastily handed me my bagel bag. On the ride home I asked my partner in crime to ensure that there were 3 bagels in the bag because they probably \"F-ed\" the order up. He assured me that the quantity was correct. When I got home, I feverishly ripped open the wrapping on the two everything bagels, like a joyous child on Christmas Day, only to find     that the bagels had the tomatoes omitted and the cream cheese barely exceeded a skim coat. The breakfast sandwich was anemic at best with barely any protein on it. I am so glad that I expected disappointment. Honestly I'm not too upset because closer to my house there is a new bagel shop: Red House bagels, where the staff is courteous, the shop is cleaner, and the bagels a bit larger. Red House is my new bagel stop.  Sorry Newtown Bagel Co, you've been replaced. Although your actual bagels are slightly better tasting, it is not enough to reconcile the pain points associated with your operations. My words of advice, replace (don't clean) your ceiling tiles and clean the filth from the grid. Having almost 10 years of food and beverage experience, I would hate to see what your walk-in and floors behind the counter look like. Coach your employees on courteous service, or maybe treat them better and they might pass that on to your patrons. Oh and maybe write the orders down before entering them into the POS, because sometimes those machines aren't as navigable for some operators.

I opted for the lasagna, and it was NASTY. The pasta itself was overcooked, which I can live with if bolstered by a decent sauce, quality/fresh meat, and good cheese. This lasagna offered NONE of these things. The sauce was the worst offender. Packed with sugar, it was a VERY SWEET, very thin red/marinara sauce. There were no spices or typical Italian seasonings, no garlic, no onion flavor, none of the deep, rich flavors that typically adorn good Italian-style food.

We had been talking about coming here for ages and just never got around to it. We finally made it and now I'm regretting it. Most of their pre-arranged menu items are spicy options. While I like spice every now and then, it doesn't always like me (old age means we live and breathe indigestion). There is a build your own option, so I thought I would go for that. You get 4 vegetables and anything else is extra. The average price of the pre-arranged menu items is about $10. So I figured the base of a build your own would be about 8 or 9 and then you add. As I'm going through the line, I start to get my veggies and choose avocado. \"That will be an extra $2\"....... TWO DOLLARS?? I can buy a whole avocado across the street for $2?! I say no thank you and move on to the cheese. \"That will be $.79 extra\" I mean... okay, that won't break the bank, frustrating that it's not included but okay, throw it in. I move down to the meat, I'll have chicken. \"That'll be an extra $3 dollars.\" .......... ..... seriously??? I very politely took a hard pass on that. Because in order to get anything with substance and taste, this wrap is looking to be close to $20. I understand that you are paying for freshness and convenience, but there is a line. At least I was hopeful for something tasty once my veggie wrap was complete. Unfortunately, it was dry and the only flavor I could strongly taste was some kind of blue cheesy situation (that I didn't ask for so I'm still not sure what it was).

I was too pressed for time, to send it back, so I had to eat it as is.\nHad lunch there recently and decided to try the Miso ramen.  The broth was ok, but somewhat overpowered by the taste of that prechopped garlic some restaurants use for convenience - it does not flatter the broth at all.  Prechopped garlic is a travesty.\nAlso, I would much rather have tofu or seitan, than Impossible burger (what little there was).  The final thing that really dragged it down is that there was literally almost a whole onion's worth of barely cooked, large onion slices.  I had to pull a bunch out, so I wasn't getting a giant mouthful of onion with every bite. If there were bean sprouts in there, I really couldn't detect them. With a veg. ramen, it would be nice to have some kind of mushrooms - just more texture in general.  It feels like the keep it boring so you'll pay more money for extras.  It's $13.50 already.

There is a nice patio area but it is located next to the mall entrance. \nOur server was very friendly and we ordered a drink while we scanned the menu. Drinks were tasty and the top shelf alcohol drove the prices a little high. \nMy husband and I both decided on the filet combos. He chose a crab cake and I chose the scallops. The food arrived in a timely manner and it was hot. The crab cake was large with nice solid chunks of lump crab. I was surprised to see the scallops were the size of quarters and maybe an inch thick. Although small, they were sweet and cooked well. The sides were pablano au gratin potatoes, Sriracha carrots, Yukon mashed and asparagus. They all tasted fine but nothing stood out as amazing. Run of the mill flavor and the veggies were not bright or fresh looking. The steaks were cooked perfectly (just a little under medium) but there was a hard char on one side. What should have been the star of the plate ended up ruining the taste of everything. There was so much seasoning on the steak that it had burned and gave the steak an extremely salty, bitter taste that overpowered everything on the plate. I know that salt is an essential part of cooking a steak but this was just too much for my taste. \nI guess if it weren't for the price I probably would give this restaurant a higher rating. I expect much more from the food when I have a tab of $125 (+ tax and tip) for 2 cocktails and 2 entrees.

This business is a lot of show, without the go.   Service has been the overall department that has been completely lacking along with some breakfast items are products of horrible cooking.  First time: asked for black coffee and a matcha latte, dad didn't get his coffee until our food already arrived (which also seemed to take forever) and I actually never received my matcha latte after asking and reminding waiters more than eight times, 8!!! It got to be comical, which is why we counted.  By the end of our breakfast they finally offered it to me in it as a to go drink and still had the audacity to charge me for it, so I said no.  Second visit, was dinner with friends, this was a much more pleasant experience, there was four of us, we shared a bottle of wine and I remember I liked my food. No complaints here. Third time, was another breakfast round... I'm not sure what it is about breakfast but I don't think they do a good job for breakfast. To start with, we were given menus for both breakfast and lunch, which was appreciated, but no drink menus and we were specifically interested in mimosas or Bloody Mary's etc. because we didn't know what to order, or what was our options were... my dad ordered a Bloody Mary, and I ordered a Mimosa. I only mention this because it was frustrating to see other people have different variations of mimosas and also bloody mary's, other breakfast cocktails which we didn't even know existed.  My dad ordered a ham and cheese omelette with his side of home fries. I ordered the power bowl muesli.  We got through two drinks before the food came, which actually was a long time. By the time our food came, the order was wrong - my dad had fruit, but no home fries as he requested.  We immediately let our server know, and she said she would go grab them.  Additionally, our plates were extremely bland.  Just an omelette, no garnish or sides at all (other than the fruit in the side bowl.  The plates just looked sad.  Also, I could tell by looking at the omelette it wasn't good, that's how bad it was, and my dad concurred.  The wait staff failed to bring his home fries in any kind of fast or quick manner, so we reminded our bartender, who then reminded to server, once my dad got a refill on his coffee we also then reminded that server as well.  We ate through the entire meal, never got the home fries, and in the end right as our check was being delivered we mentioned the homefries again, and that's when the bartender sent a server running for them, and as we were signing our check is when they came out and were offered as a \"to go\" option.  While a simple side, it was really disappointing to go the entire breakfast with an awkward feeling of  \"I guess they just don't care\" and instead of comping anything, the manager offered me a $15 off coupon the next time we came in.  It's just hard to ever want to come in again... and didn't feel like an adequate apology on a $45 breakfast.  And lastly my dads omelette tasted like McDonalds.  Only upside was that my muesli power bowl was delicious, just hard to believe it took as long as it did to come out or that anything cost as much as it did with as horrible of service and lack of \"care\" put behind anything that was done there.", "date": "2018-01-21 16:00:52"}, {"_key": "1823947", "_id": "reviews/1823947", "_rev": "_fNyy2t---U", "review_id": "YS3l7lhlFUmAxbw-11qWCQ", "user_id": "1UCQOJxaOKqugbglLPd5ig", "business_id": "MZW_eTFYFBvHYg5OFqDRCA", "stars": 2, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I saw a sign that said free for kids on Monday.

It's a good 45v minute drive from my home, and this is like my 5th visit.Upon arrival, I'm told that I can not pick up the equipment unless someone called me?  \"Do you listen to your voicemails?\". No answer. I had to get a little bucky and insist that they put all my equipment together as I'm not making this trip again.

I expected more of a shrimp dish with some pasta underneath, but it was more like a pasta dish with minimal seafood. The shrimp was small and tasted like typical frozen shrimp. Like the appetizer, there wasn't really any real crab meat, just small sliver here and there. The pasta was fine but felt a tad overcooked. It honestly tasted like a pasta dish I could make quickly at home. And for around $26, that's ridiculous. My husband had the jumbo Louisiana shrimp with jalape\u00f1o grits. Luckily, his shrimp were large and flavorful. But the rest of the dish fell flat. The grits had very little flavor. \n\nToward the end of our meal a very large group came into the bar, it almost seemed like a post-wedding thing. They were very rude and kept backing into not only our chairs and table, but the people around us as well. A lot of us were getting frustrated and the staff couldn't have cared less.

I, and my friends and family visited this restaurant this evening. We were disappointed in the food ordered, but more importantly, we were absolutely shocked at the behavior of the owner. I was served a dish I did not order. I did ask the server about this, and she said they had run out of the ingredients to make it. Ok- that happens. But, in past experience, I have been notified soon after placing my order, and allowed to choose something else. She said the meatless version of this breaded ravioli (cheese) was available, so I chose that. It arrived after my companions finished their meals. As she placed the plate on the table, she immediately asked if I wanted a carryout container. What I needed was a fork, but that had been removed with the food they had chosen for me. As I now felt very unwelcome I responded, \"Yes\". A server came back with a container, and my bill. Of note, I was told that my entree would be \"comped\", when the replacement meal was brought. The bill didn't reflect this. I was charged the full price for what I originally ordered! I brought this to her attention, and I did state,  that in my opinion, there were so many errors made, that if not soon corrected, could have a negative impact on their business. She left,  and  a man who identified himself as the owner came to our table and said he wanted to know \"What is the problem?\" We informed him of the substitution, and he apologized for the mistake. Before we had a chance to thank him for that unsolicited acknowledgement, he proceeded to tell us that the servers said we were cursing and throwing things. Not true. As we tried to deny this egregious accusation, he continually interrupted us. Clearly, his intent was to create a hostile situation, which we wanted no part of. My husband handed him cash to pay the bill and requested it be rung up so that the change would be given back, but the owner was relentless in his argument. FINALLY, the owner took the money, and a server returned with the change. Nothing was\" comped\", and we paid for the more expensive entree, for which, they did not have the ingredients!!

I have been going to this restaurant for over 10 years now and today was horrible. Went for a long needed date night with my fianc\u00e9 and felt like we were pushed out the door even tho the place was basically empty. Arrived at 6pm and was out by 6:30. Very good for a quick lunch but not for a nice date night. Bill was brought to us even before we asked. The worst of it all was 30 mins after I got home a was feeling very ill and was running back and forth from the washroom all night. Literally water coming out of my butt. Not cool! I called to let them know and asked to talk to the manager. The employee told me there was no manager available but he insisted I can't handle spicy foods and that's why I was so sick. I told him I eat Sombal and sriracha like ppl eat ketchup and can handle spicy, I eat very spicy foods on a regular basis. He was very rude and made me feel bad about what happened. I just wanted to let him know what happened. Not cool Numchok Wilai. U just lost a 10 year long customer. I'm a hairstylist and recommend ur restaurant to all my clients today as I talked about my date night.
