You order at the counter and they deliver it.\nMy daughter and I tried the sushi bowl. You pick up a piece of paper and  select from a choice of proteins, vegetables, rice and toppings. I like the fact that it is on paper and you don't have to guess what things are or have to shout over the counter to tell the server what you want. The sushi bowl was good but not wonderful. The choices particularly of the vegetables seemed a little too limiting and I felt I had more rice than other food items. The sauces were tasty. My husband ordered the Maui roll which is my favorite roll at the 96th street location and this just was not up that standard. It was good but the quality and consistently was not as good as at 96th street. I would go back though and I think a lot of people would be happy with the sushi bowls. I do want to make a comment about the low reviews that people have given the place because of service. People - it is a sushi place - it isn't McDonalds- so it will be a bit slower. You are not going to order and get out of there in five minutes even though it is called express. As a healthy alternative to fast food in the area, it is worth the wait. Oh and try the bubble tea.

Definitely a cool place to meet up with friends. It's very pricey but the foods are tasty, different and beautifully presented.\n\nMy all time favorite dish so far has been the griddled mushrooms! These are so freaking delicious! If you love mushrooms, definitely try this! My friends and I ordered four servings ($8 per small plate) in one sitting. We'd share one small plate, then decide...just one more. There's a poached egg served on top. I recommend poking the egg and letting the yolk coat the mushrooms. Trust me. The mushrooms are cooked to perfection. There's just a bit of a crunch when you bite. Not too soft that can eat them without chewing. Honestly, these mushrooms taste like heaven in your mouth!\n\nI also liked the popcorn chicken ($9 for bowl of about 10-12). At first glance, these look like donut holes. But in a way, they also remind me of the chicken balls, you might find in a Chinese food buffet. The outside is crunchy and dusted with popcorn. The round ball of chicken inside is soft. At times, I found the section between the outer crunchy part and just around the chicken, a bit doughy. It would also be nice if there was some sort of sauce to dip these into, for extra flavor. My friends and I ordered a total of three bowls. I definitely recommend sharing. After eating three chicken balls, I personally had my fill. \n\nAnother beautifully presented and tasty dish, is the crunch salad for $13. This dish looks like a tower of fancy shredded coleslaw. It's made with raw, pickled and fried veggies. When brought to your table, the servers pour the house made dressing, around and on top of this tower. All the while, you're thinking, WOW. Fancy! It's so pretty, you kind of feel bad tearing it down to eat it. Good thing it tastes as good as it looks! It tastes fresh and has just the right amount of dressing. We had two orders of this salad.\n\nLast but not least, we had the potato and squash gnocchi for $25. Ironically, the most expensive dish we ordered, was the biggest disappointment. I generally love eating duck. However, one taste of the gnocchi made me turned off by this dish. Hard to explain exactly why. My friend described it as \"too strong of a taste.\" You know how lamb has a distinct taste? Well this dish had a strong taste, but unfortunately, in my opinion, not a good tasting one. The weird thing was, my other friend, who is generally more picky with food, actually ate all the duck meat. He also said he also liked the taste of the broth. In the end, the only thing left in the bowl was the gnocchi. It just had too much of that \"too strong taste\" infused into it.\n\nOverall, even though I didn't love all the dishes during this visit, I still would recommend trying this place out.

Pollo a la brasa.... Rotisserie chicken.... Whatever you wanna call it.... I call it a technique done here with love and pride. Lets be clear, you will find no comparison coming from your grocer deli section or at the checkout isle.\n\nWhy do I think this chicken have some TLC put into it? On biting down of this chicken you can note seasoning flavors down to the bone. This is an inclination that prior to even getting into the rotisserie oven, these birds spend some time in some form of marinating process. Building flavor, the chicken also has a seasoning rub all over the skin.\n\nLets go to this rotisserie oven. Another unique element is this oven has a charcoal or grill like component. This gives the chicken a smoky element in the flavor build. As these birds turn in this oven, they keep moist from the natural drippings dropping from bird to bird as they rotate through this oven. In turn, this a reason why some people may note some pieces the skin end up dry and crispy and others get moist or soggy skin on their chicken In the end, you end up with this tender, smoky, well seasoned, fall off the bone goodness. Wait.... how can they add more flavor? Cuenelli's serves it with two dipping sauces, a chimichurri  which gives a herbaceous and slightly spicy flavor, and an aioli which has a garlicky - lemony element.\n\nRound out this meal with some solid sides. Must haves for me would be the cilantro rice. Another herbaceous addition that works well with this meal. I got to use the word herbaceous a few times in this review, it has reflects such great imagery for food talk:) Must have beans with rice no? I pick the spicy pinto beans over the black beans at this establishment but lets be clear these beans are pretty spicy. I also love the maduros here. These sweet plantatains are cooked to perfection where the outsides has this caramelization from the natural sugar of the sweet plantain, leaving you with this toffee-like, stick to your tooth exterior and soft and sweet interior. \n\nWash all down with Inca cola or a bottle of chicha limena.  Inca cola is almost like a cola champagne or a cream soda type of drink. Chicha Limena I say is Christmas in a bottle. This juice has a floral base blended with cinnamon and cloves.\n\nThough Cuenelli's Peruvian Style Rotisserie Chicken have many other notable Latin dishes, the one thing that comes to mind to me is this chicken made with love.

Big portions at decent prices. You won't leave hungry!\n\nAnd now for a full review:\n\nI have been to this Fellini's Cafe and the one in Bryn Mawr several times and each time I've visited there have been some memorable moments...and there have been speed bumps that keep this place from reaching its full potential.\n\nOn my latest visit this past Friday night, I made reservations for 730. My beautiful wife and I arrived right at 730. Although there were two vacant tables available, it took them at least 10 minutes or so to seat us. And when they did, they broke up a table for 6 instead of putting us at the 2 seater. Odd.\n\nBeing out and away from the kids for a few hours, we wanted at least a little bit of privacy, instead of sitting next to (pretty much connected to) a table of four. We asked the manager if we could be moved to the 2 seater...he said fine. Another 5-10 minutes (too long!) later a member of the wait staff came and, without any indication as to his intentions, whisked up our bottle of wine and silverware and ran off to the other table. Not a problem, but some eye contact and a simple 'follow me please' with even a hint of a smile would have been lovely. We shrugged and just rolled with it.\n\nThe interior is quaint, and the lighting is dim. It's a nice place for a romantic meal. But it is LOUD. So loud I would say this place is kid friendly despite being in such close quarters with your neighbors. Not sure if we'd ever try taking our four kids there (actually I'm certain we won't) but one or two can be done without much trouble.\n\nOur waitress was extremely polite and offered the energy and enthusiasm that our other friend lacked.\n\nFor dinner, we ordered a caesar salad to share and for our main courses my wife opted for her usual tagliatelli with mushroom cream sauce and i had what i always have, the tortellini pasticiatti.\n\nComplimentary with the meal were two pieces of bruschetta (very nice) and a small loaf of crusty Italian bread, which is served with butter packets (which perhaps only I find strange for an Italian restaurant?). \n\nOverall the food was delicious, except for a few somewhat minor hiccups: \n\n1. The caesar salad was served on a warm plate. The salad was excellent and would have been legendary had it been served on a chilled (or at least not warm!) plate.\n\n2. I am pretty sure they used frozen peas in the tortellini dish, which is fine with me as long as you make sure the peas are thawed before you serve it! Only a few peas were not quite thawed, but it marred what was otherwise a perfectly crafted masterpiece of a dish.\n\nWhen we paid, the manager allowed us to use an expired gift card. That was a very nice gesture and one that required no push from us to induce.\n\nAll in all, I'll keep visiting Fellini because it's relatively inexpensive and they do most everything well.", "date": "2012-07-16 17:27:36"}, {"_key": "1786900", "_id": "reviews/1786900", "_rev": "_fNyy0Ye--E", "review_id": "m6EMoIqkLWn01UrqVOI2yA", "user_id": "86Fgk1s0tAVioJtVnJeBHg", "business_id": "W4ZEKkva9HpAdZG88juwyQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "If you're looking for a great brunch place in New Orleans, definitely come here!\n\nMy boyfriend and I had brunch here on Sunday, and we loved it!

My boyfriend enjoyed the fried chicken livers and the fried oyster, but those are not two of my favorite things.\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the shrimp and grits.  Oh my goodness... so good! The shrimp are bacon-wrapped, and the grits are true Southern grits.  I will definitely order this dish again when I get the chance to return.

However, I am from Buffalo, NY, and am a chicken-finger connoisseur, so I decided to give this place a chance.  Additionally, it was on a road trip of sorts.  We had been at the beach all day and were halfway back home to central Tampa.\n\nThe service is amazing!  I have never seen fast-food workers who take so much pride in their jobs.  These people were drinking the Zaxby's cool-aid!  They seemed more like Disney employees than fast-food workers.  Both a female counter gal and a male (possible the manager/franchisee) went out of their way to make sure we liked everything.  \n\nThe food was a solid 4 stars, but my review overall is rounded up for the above mentioned points.  We had the chicken finger sandwiches on Texas toast.  While the chicken fingers themselves were super juicy and moist, the Texas toast was too greasy to eat them on.  I love sauce and enjoyed the variety.  We tried the Zax, hot honey mustard, insane hot and ranch.  What is missing from the sauce variety, for me, is a spicy bbq and blue cheese.  Serving ranch with hot sauce is an insult to the folks in Buffalo that created the cuisine.  Aside from the bread and sauce small issues, I really enjoyed our meal.  Additionally, it was so cheap!!  $12 and change for 2 meals with drinks.  \n\nI am a fan!  This place doesn't quite hit all the marks of Buffalo-Inspired food, but it does a pretty good job of putting a southern twist on chicken fingers!", "date": "2017-08-16 15:51:51"}, {"_key": "1786933", "_id": "reviews/1786933", "_rev": "_fNyy0Yq--D", "review_id": "M4Y-_lMqSAwHQFxFPWGobA", "user_id": "hbSa1RpUO6Ka-AKnfmCF_A", "business_id": "2SYEGA2fZLdzZQ9lmIfM5Q", "stars": 2, "useful": 2, "funny": 2, "cool": 0, "text": "Food- C+\nBeer- B-\nAtmosphere- C\nService- B\n\nWent to Urban Village per request from a member of my group of friends to check it out after a month of their opening.

He was helpful with the beer selection though, so a plus there. In addition the lighting outside on the porch was just pitiful going into the sunset. You can't see anyone. Aim for a spot inside the restaurant if you are arriving at night. Great bathrooms though, very clean.\n\nWe all ordered some variant of the pizza just to try them all out. Out of 7 pies that we ordered, I really only liked 1, maybe two of them and even so, they were mostly dough and barely any cheese or toppings on them. For the price tag of around $12-14 a pie, that was really disappointing. Maybe the other food is better, but I cannot comment on that and only through my experience.\n\nThe beer itself was good, but I've had better from other brewpubs in the city at cheaper prices as well.

Our reservation was for 7pm last Saturday and when we arrived, it was surprisingly not fully seated! A long bar counter actually allows diners to show up without reservations, something I wish I would have known earlier. Large windows made it feel quite open and as the night went on, the dark interior gave it a very trendy atmosphere.\n\nTo start, I had my mind set on a Caesar, a truly Canadian drink. I didn't even bother to look at the drinks menu (whoops!) and when I ordered, our server Chris kindly told me they had removed it from the menu. Aperol Spritz then? North 53\u2032s mixologist Brendan Brewster (formerly Woodwork, Manor Bistro), happily accommodated my off menu request. \n\nJoe and I decided to order off the a la carte versus the $85 tasting meu (lowered from the original opening $100), although many tables were doing so. There's just something about being able to choose what to eat!\n\nThe \"Various Beets\" has been on the menu for some time now and that's always a sign that it's a winner. Indeed it was. Beets sourced from Riverbend Gardens, done in a multitude of ways: sorbet, pickled, and dehydrated meringue; layered with a goat's cheese mousse, red wine vinaigrette, candied walnuts, and nasturtium (a watercress-like leaf with a peppery taste). Best presentation ever. And incredibly delicious! The beet meringue was the most intriguing, dehydrated to the point that upon contact with moisture (your mouth), it almost dissolved into a burst of beet flavor. What just happened there?!\n\nWhile I was pondering away on the use of a dehydrator, Joe was trying the duck rillette, which he chose from the menu. Similar to a pate, the Fourwhistle Farm's duck was cooked until tender, shredded and formed, topped with pieces of smoked duck breast, and cherry gelee. Gastriqued cherries along with a cherry and hazelnut puree decorated the rest of the plate. Joe loved the gastriqued cherries and both of us enjoyed the smoked duck breast. More of that, please!\n\nSauteed carrots came on top of pearl barley risotto, finished with the Cheesiry's pecorino stock, freshly shaved perocrino, and watercress. Sprinkled over top was a dehydrated brown butter powder, giving the dish another layer of seasoning.\n\nThe black cod, sourced from Vancouver Island, was done to perfection and supremely moist. Little neck clams and a clam froth were mixed in with the butternut squash puree and roasted butternut squash, although a different server (not Chris) said they were oysters when he brought it out. I really enjoyed this dish and it's because of dishes like these that I'm always keen on ordering a fish entree instead of another protein. I won't know how it compares to the wild boar or milk fed veal sirloin tip until my next visit!\n\nI have learnt that two desserts will always make me happier than one and seeing that we were both 80% full, why not. Chris highly recommended the sunchoke ice cream. This dish is definitely not to be missed! Aside from the creative use of sunchoke, it was placed on a thyme sponge, layered with balsamic vinegar curd and more of the brown butter powder, this time with black malt. The ice cream was very well done, smooth, no crystals of ice and had such a pleasant flavor. The thyme sponge had a... spongey texture. Honestly one of the most interesting things to eat, next to the beet meringue we had earlier. Really starting to wonder what kind of dehydrator they're using back there!\n\nOur second dessert was the wild blueberry sorbet, accompanying a goat's milk panna cotta. On the bottom were dried blueberries, roasted rolled oats, and a blueberry tuile to anchor the dish. All components were gorgeous, and overall the dish was very unsweetened, which can be a nice way to end a meal. The tarragon granite might not be for all, especially if you do not enjoy licorice! I didn't even know tarragon had that natural taste, it's always mixed in with other herbs when I've had it.\n\nOverall, the meal was one of the best that I've ever had. Points all around for presentation, creativity, and taste! It's like an episode on the Food Network. Not only that, the service was excellent and the kitchen was timely with our plates. Chris was extremely knowledgeable on the menu and its ingredients. I had read from some diners that the atmosphere was quite formal, but not so when we went. Quite relaxed in my opinion but they may have eased up, much like the cost of the plates.", "date": "2014-04-01 15:47:54"}, {"_key": "1787315", "_id": "reviews/1787315", "_rev": "_fNyy0b---B", "review_id": "uCH1DEwtOwqa8jBNgKWCzQ", "user_id": "tw7hr8sdk-N6teJVlAx8lQ", "business_id": "caGpaptBP4BKJkpH5W6cvA", "stars": 2, "useful": 22, "funny": 12, "cool": 8, "text": "Me: \"Hi!

Even the music playing over the loud speaker was downtempo, providing a \"big city\" feel to the establishment.\n\nWe were greeted instantly, and seated in the dining area, being that we were here for sushi and not hibachi.

We came prepared with reservations, but the restaurant actually began quieting out while our delicious meal was ramping up; the tables offer more elbow room than the photographs online belie.  As the name of the evening suggests, no menu is in play here; you'll let your friendly server know if you have any food allergies or particular preferences, and before long watch your customized meal unfold.  That's a three-course meal, $30, plus $12 for three half-glass wine pairings.\n\nAs starters, we were served lamb meatballs -- likely the favorite of the night -- and goat cheese-stuffed poblano peppers.  The peppers had a good bit of spice offset by the chalkiness of the goat cheese, making an excellent pairing for my Soave (white wine).  The mains were a corvina fish delicately cooked in wax paper and a swordfish steak served over asparagus with homegrown tomatoes and \"love sauce.\"  The corvina came out on the rarer side, perhaps a little too complex for this Midwesterner's palate, but the hearty swordfish was some of the best seafood I've tasted in Missouri.  Dessert comprised a champagne gelatin and a chocolate tart, both of which were topped by fluffy homemade whipped cream and quickly eaten.\n\nThe staff at Home Wine Kitchen made our visit pleasant, acting casual yet professional during our meal.  The restaurant patrons seemed to be largely industry types that oohed and aahed about the cuisine (perhaps a trifle self-importantly, but this Yelper is no saint himself).  I was surprised to note that other diners were served the same courses as we were (albeit in different configurations), when I was under the assumption there would be a little more variation; however, I can only imagine the challenge such an endeavor would pose to the talented kitchen.  The interior, lighting, and volume here were all very good.\n\nBy the end of the evening, we realized that putting yourself in the hands of the chef is not for the faint of heart, as evidenced by one conversation near us during the meal that all but stopped when a beautiful whole fish was served to the table.  Leaving the restaurant, I was glad that I had tried No Menu Monday, but did wonder what the meal would have been like had I ordered off the menu.

It is not just a tourist trap, even though you can find it at the end of the SB pier past all the other tourists traps. Love to get the rock crab deal ($25 for a 2-3lb rock crab with onion rings) \n\nMy favorite moment:\n\nI will never forget the day we tried their California King crab for the first time. It was a weekend when all my girls came back to town and we had gone kayaking/ S.U.P. (With paddle sports from the Harbor area) and we had made plans to grab an early dinner from the shellfish co. While on the water we saw them pulling up fresh cali kings from the side of the pier. After our hour on the ocean, we were famished but still aware that it could be a wait since the place is small and popular. Luckily since it was early (before 5pm dinner rush) we were seated quickly. The server recommended the cali kings, said we wouldnt regret it because they were really fresh. We looked over and there they were! Being dumped into the tanks. They were kicking and trying to climb out. \n\nPriced at $17.95 per lb, they came anywhere between 1.5 to 3 lbs. I went for a 2pounder. That first succulent bite was heaven. And I mean, damn that is one buttery heaven. Each morsel was so large, so sweet..all of my girls and I were silent, with glistening eyeballs staring at each other. \n\nAfter that day, I couldn't get that crab out of my mind. Any chance I could I wanted to go back before the season was over.\n\nBut be careful, a 3 pounder means you're eating a $75 crab. Only negative is that you can only choose between soup or salad. For that price..I should've gotten both. It's okay, just add a $1 and you can both i guess. \n\nBesides the crab, the oysters are always good and I highly recommend the uni appetizer. \n\nOkay I really recommend the uni appetizer. I usually buy my own uni fresh and shuck it at home, but these they place on top of a fresh scallop on top of a lime pinwheel with a side of ponzu. It's so fresh and clean, that they leave the empty uni shell as a center piece with its spines still wiggling.", "date": "2017-04-20 04:19:46"}, {"_key": "1787761", "_id": "reviews/1787761", "_rev": "_fNyy0d6--I", "review_id": "8qLaz2xc9aVTglmWFbKm5Q", "user_id": "6CFozKX_jLeGrleFQGl8-Q", "business_id": "A-8K66Kx7fMXkayG_3zdJQ", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "La Madeleine has a nice covered outside area that is great on a day that's not too hot.

Their sandwiches and salads are good and made to order. The seasoned chicken is moist and flavorful and available on several different salads and sandwiches. They have a hot plate with already cooked French decadent items like croque monsieur, potato galette and quiches. These are sometimes good and sometimes a little dried out from being on the hot plate. I recommend the fresh made sandwiches instead as a better bet. \n\nThere is also a small bakery section with some tempting bread and sweets options.

Thank you, thank you, Chef Bond...!\n\nThis was our favorite activity of New Orleans. Absolutely a blast.\n\nAs other reviews note, the hands-on cooking classes take place in Chef Richard Bond's personal home in the Algier's Point neighborhood of New Orleans, directly across the Mississippi River from the French Quarter. \n\nWe took a 5 minute ferry ride across the river.  Fare is $2 each.  Bring exact change or you are welcome to overpay with bigger bills.  The ferry ran every 1/2 hour.\n\nHis home is a pleasant 2 block walk from the ferry station.  If you have a car - which I never recommend in the French Quarter -  you can drive the bridge instead of taking the ferry.\n\nClass was 3 1/2 or 4 hours - I'm not exactly sure because we enjoyed Chef's generously flowing wine so much... :-)\n\nIt was definitely hands on. We did everything - cleaned and chopped vegetables, made two different kinds of roux, cooked gumbo and \u00e9touff\u00e9e, made chocolate bread pudding and mocha whiskey sauce - we did everything.  Chef emailed us the recipes and other helpful info.\n\nClass took place around a large center island in his residential kitchen. There was plenty of room for 5 of us, and he accepts no more than 6 in a class. You have to take turns, but hopefully you'll have pleasant classmates like we did. They made the experience fun. There is plenty of room if everyone has a little patience and shares a little.  If your mother didn't teach you to share, book and pay for a private class.  No problem, but it is fine with 5 or 6 people.\n\nChef Bond is a very good teacher, and talked at length about the differences between Creole and Cajun food and cooking styles.\n\nChef Bond's cooking bona fides are the real deal - he studied in Florence, Italy and Le Cordon Bleu in NYC.  He recently appeared on the television show Chopped.\n\nWe are both accomplished cooks, and both learned a lot and totally loved the class.  At least one of our classmates wasn't quite as comfortable with a knife or frying pan, and she seemed to enjoy the class just as much.\n\nThe wine... was very tasty and generously flowing. No, the wine didn't start until the chopping ended\nand the knives were put away.  As Chef said, \"we're making gumbo, not thumbo!\"\n\nThe food... was simply outstanding.  I have consumed a lot of bread pudding and gumbo in my life, and plenty of \u00e9touff\u00e9e. I can HONESTLY say that Chef Bond's recipes for all three are my favorites ever. His gumbo and \u00e9touff\u00e9e are not overly heavy, as many are, and his bread pudding was simply outstanding and delicious.  The best.  I'm so happy to have cooked all of these dishes, and to take home his fantastic recipes.  As is said, I no longer fear the roux.\n\nHe does other, more advanced classes, or you can select the entire menu when advance booking your class.\n\nThe experience was worth every penny.  Chef Bond is funny and delightful, and a great teacher.  His helper John is a funny and very nice man. \n\nWe give Mardi Gras School of Cooking our highest endorsement and recommendation. \n\nWe hope you'll love it, as we did.", "date": "2015-05-26 15:41:31"}, {"_key": "1787867", "_id": "reviews/1787867", "_rev": "_fNyy0em---", "review_id": "6MXZioag9TYB3p3GVzoSwQ", "user_id": "4RxTUFwMtAKFVw4AJ4TJZA", "business_id": "I1h0GRYp86eX-XqwVXsSGA", "stars": 5, "useful": 4, "funny": 5, "cool": 2, "text": "Hmmm...neighborhood sketchiness factor on a scale of 1-10 was about a 5.  \n\nBut the idea of being able to have a crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the inside ball in my mouth made the trip well worth it.

Better on the plate than in my stomach, but maybe they could have served them on paper towels or something...\n\nBoth girls ordered brownie milkshakes.  They were delicious, but tiny.

What!?  Note to self, Happy Hour Tuesday through Sunday (I think it's through Sunday) 50% off from 3-6 on Dine in only.  Yes Please!\n\nSo we decided that we wanted to try a few things.  We ordered the cauliflower pizza, a cheeseburger on a cauliflower bun, with a side of cauliflower sticks, and a kids order of the zoodle spaghetti.  Our total, $16.  I mean...  So inexpensive, and for all healthy food.  Heck yes!\n\nWe grabbed a table inside, we were the only patrons in there, which made me a little sad, because if the food is good, and healthy then we want this place to last.\n\nWe get the pizza first.  2 small cauliflower pizzas, so we each got one.  OMG!  They were so full of flavor, the cauliflower crust totally holds up, it was so darn good.  I couldn't get enough!  Then the zoodle spaghetti came out.  YUM!  Why have I never made zoodles before!?  They needed a little salt, but that's ok, they choose to not over salt or pepper their food, because everyone has different tastes.  I like that.  Then the burger came out.  It was HUGE!  There was so much meat!  We cut it in half to split.  Now, I like my burgers with ketchup, or ranch, some sort of sauce.  There wasn't any sauce on this, but man, it didn't need it.  There was an abundance of flavor.  The cauliflower bun again held up so well, and that already has a ton of flavor.  Then the meat was so well seasoned.  There were the freshest yellow tomatoes on top.  I was in Heaven!  The cauliflower sticks were pretty darn good, I think I would have loved them even more if I had ranch to dip them in.  But they were still good.  We ate everything and I was so FULL!  That's what happens when you eat healthy.  \n\nSo then we decided that we had to each buy a loaf of cauliflower bread.  They are $12 a loaf, but it comes with 12 slices.  And they can last in the fridge for about 2 weeks. I think this is a great deal.  We also saw desserts and had to go there.  I got a gluten free chocolate chip cookie, I mean... It had so much flavor, a little salt, a little sweet, it's HUGE and I ate the whole thing!  We also had a chocolate muffin, I believe it was gluten free, vegan and paleo.  It had a banana taste, and was ooey, gooey, soft and delicious.\n\nI hope this place keeps up the good work on making such healthy food, and I hope that people keep coming here.

They have a huge selection of rotating flavors, and the flavors tend to match with what's seasonal, so you will have stuff like Pumpkin and Chestnut in the winter and fruity stuff and berries in the summer. However, they do have a fairly stable core of flavors like Nocciola Piemontese (Hazelnut), Fior Di Latte (Milk), and Cioccolato Scuro (Dark Chocolate) that are available most days. They will let you sample as many flavors as you would like before you place your order, so take advantage of that if you don't know what you want (or, if you already know what you want, if you just want some free samples). Since I love pretty much anything that has peanut butter in it, one of my favorite flavors was the Peanut Butter gelato, which was peanut gelato with a swirl of peanut butter mixed in - SO GOOD. Others that I really liked include Bacio (chocolate and hazelnut gelato with caramelized hazelnuts; it tastes like Nutella with crunchy hazelnuts tossed in for good measure), Chocolate Scuro (seriously dark and rich, this is the gelato of any chocolate lover's dreams), and Turkish Coffee (a really perky coffee flavor with a hint of cardamom giving it a nice kick), but really, I don't think I ran into a flavor that I didn't like. They also have some rather interesting flavors using alcohol and rums - Cucumber with Grey Goose, Dark and Stormy, etc. \n\nOkay, so I really love the gelato here, but honestly, the prices are pretty steep. It costs close to $6 for a medium cup, and even though the medium lets you get your choice of up to 3 different flavors, that's still a really expensive cup of gelato.

Unlike Chinese food, Greek food hasn't been adapted very much to the American palate. That's one thing I love about it. I've eaten Greek food in Greece, and, with a few exceptions, it's pretty much the same everywhere. What sets one Greek restaurant apart from another are two things: selection of food and quality/preparation of ingredients.\n\nHellas is a very large restaurant. They offer free parking behind the building (a ticket your server gives you at the end of your meal). I'm eating there anyway, I get free parking while I'm at it. In season, the wait for a table can take a minute, so be prepared. The bakery is always mobbed, so be ready for that at any time of year. My only real issue with Hellas is how close the tables are together. It's tight, guys. Don't consider this place for heart to heart conversations.\n\nI love the menu here. Very traditional Greek, with a lot of items you don't see and many items you do normally see. On my most recent visit, we got the trio of spreads and I ordered a Chicken Souvlaki sandwich. The trio of spreads is a lovely hummus, perfect tzatziki and a feta spread (my favorite!) with perfectly toasted pita triangles. The Chicken was really, really good.

This location is great, friendly staff always clean and a fun place to shop.\n\n\nTJ's is crazy different from any other grocery store and most people don't know!\nA few things about Trader Joes:\n\n1. Everything with the Trader Joe's Logo is \n-GMO FREE\n-Has No artificial Coloring\n-Has No artificial Preservatives\n\n2.You can try anything is the store!! As long as it doesn't have to be heated (frozen meals etc) you can bring it to the sample station and they will open it for you to try!! I'm talking Cheese, juice, fruits, ice cream, yogurt, chips, protein bars, cereals, candy..anything!\n\n3. They are always sampling items!! While most stores do this for you to buy things (of course they want you to buy it too) Trader Joe's actually wants you to try something you normally would never buy.  They have so many unique and different foods, this lets you try something you may have never even seen in the store before.\n\n4. They always have new products!! This is good and bad, because if you are a fan of a seasonal item you have to stock up when you see it.  Not only do they have certain items that come out seasonally but they are always introducing new items every week.  They even have a New Item Shelf that you can check out so you don't miss anything.  Again though the down side is they are a small store and if certain items don't sell great you may never see them again.\n\n5. You can return anything, no questions asked!  They want you to try new things and if you don't like it just bring back the receipt or an empty wrapper and they will refund you on the spot.  It's also good if something you buy spoils fast.\n\n6. Every store has a mascot (a stuffed animal) the staff hides it everyday so that kids can look for it.  When you find it, go to the sample station for your free Lolipop.  Its a great idea and a great way to keep kids occupied as parents shop.\n\nThose are just some of the main things that set TJ's apart.  It is such a fun and colorful store to be in.

The menu isn't extensive, but it's got a good amount of inexpensive sandwiches, salads, and soups.  \n\nTheir Cuban Sandwich ($10 w/ side) was pretty excellent.  The bread wasn't the traditional panini-style, but a French baguette...it was still great and had a little crispness to it.  All the main ingredients (meat, mustard, pickles, cheese) were in good balance.  As a Florida boy who loves his Cuban sandwiches, I would definitely recommend this.\n\nI also tried a bit of their Royal Grille, a grilled-chese sandwich with several cheeses, as well as apple slices, on whole grain wheat bread ($8.50 w/ side, extra to add ham/turkey).  It was damn good and hit the grilled cheese craving just right.  A side salad was also done well.\n\nFor my side, I chose their \"spicy carrots\" which sounded unique.  It consists of sliced raw carrots that have been marinated in a tangy dressing with crushed red pepper, served in a cup. The carrots were cold and crisp and the flavors were fantastic.  The spice was just enough to be pleasant.  I would definitely get these again.\n\nOur food came out super quick and our service was great.

It was appropriately called \"One\". In the lyrics, it stated, \"One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do\". That may be true in love, but when it comes to dining sometimes you just want to dine alone.  If you do, avoid HWK. \n\nNot once, but twice I have been turned  away when wanting to dine here as a single person. The first time when I called to make a reservation, the young lady who answered informed me they preferred not to sit single diners at tables and that I'd have to eat at the bar.  At first I was content with that arrangement, but then she continued to tell me that  those eating at the bar can not select from the entire menu. At that point, I decided not to make the reservation.  I wanted the true HWK experience. After all the reviews have been amazing. \n\nThe second time, I stopped in for early lunch while shopping the main drag in Maplewood.  Once again, I was told I'd have to sit at the bar and order from a \"limited menu\". When I asked if I could be seated at one of the hightops in the window, she told me she needed to save those for parties of two. The kicker came when I asked if they were already reserved and she said, \"no\".  I ate else where that day. \n\nWhat I do not understand, is why can I go to Chicago dine at such top restaurants such as; Girl and the Goat, RL, The Pump Room, Table Fifty-Two, The Purple Pig, Frontera Grill and The Publican and be welcomed with open arms. Many of the chefs at these restaurants have been on Top Chef and published cookbooks.  How is it that their establishments are welcoming to the lone diner, yet a small Maplewood restaurant is not?\n\nI understand they have a small space, but if you are going to sit single diners at the bar, let them order from the entire menu. Before posting, I shared this review with other friends who are single diners and being women, they said for them they would not feel comfortable eating at the bar and would not eat here if a table was not an option. \n\nDisclaimer: I did dine here as a couple opening week and was not impressed.

I've eaten at two star restaurants. I've even eaten at a two star BJ's before. This location is leaps and bounds above that.\n\nA two star BJ's makes you wait fifteen minutes to be seated even though the restaurant is have full. Every time I've visited the Lutz location (three currently) I've gotten in and seated within a reasonable amount of time even though every booth (and the bar) was full. \n\nA two star BJ's has a very inattentive server and kitchen staff who brings out the wrong order, does not work around dietary restrictions (despite their menu saying they will) and leaves your glass empty for most of the meal. At this BJ's the server is checking on us constantly. My glass of water remains full for the duration of the evening. The longest I waited for it to be refilled was two minutes. When I order the Brussels Sprouts, I get the honey sricha sauce on the side. Not once have they failed to clarify my order and bring it out correctly. As for the taste of the sprouts, whoa doggy. Nicely charred and crispy and tossed in oil. Better Brussels Sprouts than I've had at any other Tampa restaurant. Even my meat eating, butter loving, fat indulging friends can't keep their hands off them (and that's without the sauce, who knows how it would be if they offered a vegan sauce for those sprouts). For my main course, I am enamored with BJ's vegan lentil soup. I've eaten it both as a bread bowl (hold the butter) and regular bowl. The soup is filling, slightly spicy and flavorful. Rare is it to find a chain restaurant in Tampa offering a vegan soup. Even rarer is the restaurant that offers a really good vegan soup. On one occasion I ordered the mushroom and asparagus salad (sans goat cheese). If I had to do it over again, I'd get the dressing on the side. I don't have the same love affair with dressing as a lot of people so I usually find the amount that restaurants put on to be too much. BJ's was no different.\n\nA two star BJ's has people working there that are unable to answer questions about the menu. At the Lutz location we had a gluten free diner seated with us. She asked for the gluten free menu and they obliged. She decided to order the gluten free pizza and asked the server about toppings. The server said all toppings were gluten free except for the meatballs. When another friend inquired about what barbacoa was, the waitress gave her best answer and then double checked with someone else in order to ensure that my fellow diner could make an informed decision.\n\nA two star BJ's does not bring out a garlic roll for the toddler who might be just a little less patient about waiting for her food. The Lutz location served my daughter a drink and a complimentary roll right away. I thought this was a fabulous idea because my daughter is still at the age where she tells me she wants mac and cheese and she thinks it should be there moments later. The roll helped to stem the constant \"where is my mac and cheese questions\" because she had something to snack on.\n\nDoes this location have some kinks to work out? Probably. They mixed up checks once when I was there. Had her drinks on his and vice versa. But considering that they are restaurant that has been open just a little over a month, I'd say some kinks are to be expected. \n\nKinks and all, I'm definitely a fan of BJ's.\n\n(That sounds dirty.)", "date": "2016-11-23 12:21:14"}, {"_key": "1789980", "_id": "reviews/1789980", "_rev": "_fNyy0ra--E", "review_id": "J33PTe4_rGZF8xnY3jnJgA", "user_id": "r4rj70fqMD651DgXE4ZU7A", "business_id": "wUnLSg_GKfEIQ5CQQ770_g", "stars": 4, "useful": 1, "funny": 3, "cool": 0, "text": "Slamming is the first word that comes to mind when wanting to describe this place!

Well look no further.  This is your dream hotel.  YOUR DREAM HOTEL, I TELL YOU!\n\nI have wanted to stay here for years, and back in the days when I lived in Philly I would often walk by and think \"what could I do to justify a stay here even though I live walking distance away?\"  That moment arose when my husband and I came to town for a friend's wedding and their hotel room block was at the Hotel Monaco.  Sure, it was still expensive (a place this swanky comes with a price tag!) but I told my husband that we basically had no choice but to live it up for the night and book a room.  Carpe diem.\n\nWe walked in and it was glamour from the very first second.  Everything is just gorgeous and impeccably decorated.  The customer service is unbelievable.  All I could think was \"don't slip up, Jessica, pretend you're classy!\"  We got to our room and holy cow.... who decorated?!  Don't get me wrong - I loved every square inch of it.  We found \"loud\" wallpaper, a pillow with an adorable quote, a perfectly propped up book of Alice and Wonderland, and the coolest bright red TV stand / media center that I have ever seen.  In the closet were robes (including a leopard print one) and a yoga mat (whattttt).  The bed was unbelievably comfortable and we had the most luxurious night's sleep.  And the bathtub came with bath salts so that you could really soak and relax (I didn't utilize this but it was tempting).  The ONLY thing that could have made our room better was if we had a cool view (some people I know had an incredible view of Independence Hall).  We had kind of a semi-view (ok, this is a stretch) of the Liberty Bell.  But this should tell you how great the location is - you are RIGHT in Old City.  You step outside and BOOM it's Independence Hall.  We had 45 minutes to kill and went on a guided tour of Congress Hall with no problem.  You can go to the Liberty Bell, the Betsy Ross House, the Constitution Center, or the American Jewish Museum (among about a million other cool places) without needing to hail a cab or set foot on a subway.  \n\nThe two annoying things (well, one is actually kind of cool).  The first: parking was something like $43 a night.  I mean, I get it - you're in downtown Philly in the most touristy neighborhood in the whole city.  But no way, Jose.  Fortunately I know Philly well and we found free street parking in the Grad Hospital neighborhood and took an Uber to the hotel (for about $7 each way).  Second: Lil Jon was in the house.  Seriously.  There was some type of late night event with Lil Jon as a DJ up at the roof top bar.  When we caught a cab back late at night after the wedding was over there was like a whole swarm of people trying to prevent us from crashing the Lil Jon party.  There was even some guy who looked like Secret Service blocking us from going up one of the elevators because that was, like, the Lil Jon party only elevator.  Cool your jets, I don't want to party with Lil Jon that bad.  (I mean I kind of do but you know.)\n\nCome here, stay here, feel glamorous, check out Philly tourist traps, learn a little history, wear a leopard print robe, read Alice in Wonderland, and maybe party with Lil Jon.

Seriously, it's been in limbo since the spring time. What took so long? I guess, as the saying goes, you have to wait for the good things in life.\n\nAnyways, we had a little reunion with one of my buddies from out of town and went to check out Lee House's latest digs. The place was pretty packed for a Wednesday evening and is split into two different areas, the left side more compact with smaller tables while the right side is for bigger groups of families and friends. The restaurant has a very spacious, open air feeling and they clearly put a lot of time and effort into making things look great. I was hoping that they would put more of their focus on Korean BBQ, as Edmonton is seriously lacking a good place. We shall see, I'm sure things will change when they finish renovating their original Whyte Ave shop.\n\nWhile we were waiting for my buddy to show up, we perused the menu which has quite the variety of options. We decided to try several of their BBQ options but sadly, we didn't even get to grill any meat. Sad face. Also, I have to mention service was pretty weak, even for an Asian restaurant. We could barely hear when the waitress told us what our dishes were, had to ask for tea several times, and it was hard to flag down someone to take our order. I'm sure it will get better once they settle in.\n\nWe ordered:\n- Banchan and rice bowls - the banchan were all good, especially the bean sprouts and spinach. I just wish they brought out more/re-filled them during our meal.\n- Bibimbap ($10.95) - steamed rice topped with vegetables (carrots, spinach, zucchini, daikon, bean sprouts) over a lightly fried egg.  They brought out the Korean chili paste in a separate bottle, so you can add as much as you want. The bibimbap was decent but nothing to write home about. \n- Jap chae bokeum ($11.95) - potato noodles with mixed vegetables, black fungus mushroom in a sweet soy mushroom sauce. This dish was perfectly done! Noodles had the perfect chew. I think I just love noodles. Someone teach me how to make this at home.\n- Bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced beef marinated in a sweet soy garlic sesame sauce. \n- Spicy pork loin bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced pork loin marinated in a sweet onion, garlic chili paste. Slightly spicy, full of flavour, this was my favourite bulgogi dish of the night.\n- Sweet ginger pork bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced pork loin marinated in a sweet ginger sesame soy. I didn't get too much ginger flavour from this one, but it was still quite tasty.\n\nSo to sum up, first visit (of what I'm sure will be many) was pretty good. Lots of interesting items to lure you back. We'll have to make sure next time we try out their other BBQ items and do some grilling! I'm impressed with all the good Korean restaurants in town - make sure to add this one to your list of must try.", "date": "2014-12-17 21:58:29"}, {"_key": "1790957", "_id": "reviews/1790957", "_rev": "_fNyy0yW--E", "review_id": "u34zG3sc6ixXVl59rg7mSA", "user_id": "JMsKTU2OCwC5VY8Zrl5tAA", "business_id": "Y4TGGLDzAizyXqoc-0aLUg", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 1, "cool": 2, "text": "Yay for the re-opening of American Eagle at Opry Mills!

And beneath the whites?  The reds.  Print some new menus.  And considering the venue, their wine pricing is high.  The server made no effort to sell us drinks.  \n\nThe food.  The first thing the server told us was that they were out of the soup of the day.  Ok, fine, benefit of the doubt, it must have been excellent and super-popular, right?  We started with hummus - not my choice.  Did not meet expectations.  I ordered meatloaf.  It was surprisingly dense and rather dry - full of filler.  The mashed potatoes looked more like mashed hash browns, I don't quite know how to describe them.  The green beans had to have come from a freezer bag.

More on that momentarily.\n\nGenerally I'm a huge fan of La.Va. It's close to my apartment (two blocks), and a large coffee comes in at an even $2. I buy coffee often, and I cringe every time something is run up at $1.97 or something ridiculous. It's nice knowing that I'm not going to be walking around with a pocket full of change. The opening staff is super friendly most of the time, and if you're looking for a peaceful early morning haunt to read the paper before work, this is it. There's a $10 minimum on credit cards; I just get a gift card with a couple weeks worth of funds on it and call it a day.\n\nThe food is decent, with a few selections of sandwiches and heavier dinner items. It's a strange menu for a coffee shop, but there's definitely something to eat if you're hungry, and if you eat in you'll get a salad and some pickles on the side for naught but a smile.\n\nIt would be great if they had a larger selection of baked goods, perhaps a danish other than apple, but the I suspect I would always go back to the chocolate croissant anyway. Their bagels are great, and the bacon egg and cheese is kind of the best thing on the menu. Huge slab of ham, lots of egg with the cheese stuffed inside. I don't get it often enough and am hungry thinking about it.\n\nThe loathing aspect? There are approximately  20 tables in the whole place, covered by a grand total of two outlets, and no power strips or other accommodations. Maybe it's smart business (when the laptop juice runs out, you should probably leave anyway,) but it's annoying if you want to get on the comp and can't grab a plug. Accompanied with this is the almost non-existence of available seating anytime from 2 pm to close  (at 9.) The laptop surfers descend in droves and are relentless in their occupation of every habitable surface.\n\nThis is such a nitpicky complaint but such a regular occurrence that it's annoying: their to-go cups leak.

Small plate style southern food, whom would have ever thought that up? Its amazing to watch a master at work. Seeing fine dining's take on classic southern fare is pretty fun. We started with a few cocktails which were pretty delicious; a blackberry mint julep for me and I cant remember what she ordered but it was better than mine.\n\nWe decided to order a bunch of different things, starting with the Southern Hummus and fried green tomatoes. Love the fried green tomatoes. Piping hot, nice sauce, awesome exterior crunch. Hummus was just ok. I loved the bread it came with, but the hummus didnt have much pop to it. If i didnt know it was made from peanuts, I never could have guessed.\n\nNext up were the Shrimp & Grits and mac and cheese. Shrimp and grits fell flat for me. Grits were good, but shrimp lacked seasoning. Definitely needs more flavor to not be lost in the richness of the grits. Mac and cheese was awesome. Loved the potato chip crust on top. Textural difference is awesome.\n\nHot chicken and collard greens came next. Booyah that chicken is freaking tasty. Spicy, but not overly so, juicy tender chicken with a hell of a crunch. The white bread and ranch really brought it up another level though. The ranch was incredible. I had no idea that collard greens could taste so good. My first time having them and all I have to say is wow. Loved the flavor and the nice chunks of ham hocks dispersed throughout. Awesome combination\n\nDessert time and although they didnt have espresso which normally makes me mad, their coffee is delicious. Our server told us how good it was and he was right. The cookie skillet is simply bangin. Only thing I wish is that the scoop of ice cream on top was a touch bigger. it was hard to spread it out enough to get some with every bite.

It's beautiful and really nice to just walk around and take it all in. My brother and sister have stayed here for an event, and they really enjoyed it, except for the high price tag. The convention center area itself is huge, with gorgeous carpeting, interior decor, etc. all around. There are frequently events and meetings at the convention center, so it's always pretty busy. However, what I really love is the garden area in the center of Opryland. As many of the other reviewers have pointed out, the entire area is enclosed, but it really feels like you are outside walking around in an outdoor garden that is always kept at a nice breezy 75 degrees or so. This in itself just amazes me. There are winding paths (nothing super strenuous), waterfalls, and beautiful greenery and flowers everywhere. There are quite a few shops and restaurants all around the hotel, but the pricing is pretty expensive (I will give a shoutout to Stax though -- a delicious make-your-own burger place).

I've been here once for a lunch buffet and several times for dinner. The food has always been at least pretty good, and at times has been excellent. I recommend the goat and lamb entrees. Lamb vindaloo is very good, and nicely spicy. One of the things I like best is that the kitchen gets the spice level correct almost every time. When I ask for something spicy, it comes out spicy. When I ask for something medium spicy, it's perfectly medium spicy. So often indian restaurants make things too mild for gringos, or too spicy for this gringo! \n\nThe service is what makes me hesitate to make this a regular spot. I've hardly ever had good service. It's often either too quick, or way too slow. They often sell groupons, and when went on a night close to the groupon's expiration date, the kitchen was unprepared for the busy-ness and our food took over an hour to come out. And then all of a sudden, on our last visit, my guy and I got excellent service. And there was even a very large party (seriously, like at least 40 or 50 people) going on in another room at the same time! So it's just a mixed bag. \n\nLastly, the restaurant is difficult to spot from the road. It's right off the huge intersection of 202 and Gulph Rd near the KOP mall. Take a right when you see the Peace of Pizza on the right, because Desi Village is located on the side of the building. There are only five designated spots for the restaurant. When they're full, you have to either park at the pizza place, or behind the building by a liquor store. Which reminds me of a big positive - the restaurant is a BYO, and there's a liquor store conveniently next door!

It was Labor Day.  This was a double whammy when trying to find an open restaurant.  Then MM popped into my head.  I was sure they'd be open...and they were!\n\nWe went to the location on Oak Street.  I really liked the vibe of the place.  Kind of cool funky.  There were 2 floors of seating, and also a balcony for dining outside.   Unfortunately we were unable to eat outside, as it had been raining off and on.  \n\nThe service was top notch.  Everyone we came in contact with was very nice and beers were refilled quickly...which is always a good thing.\n\nNow for the food...\n\nI ordered a Caesar salad.  It was fantastic!  Good lettuce to dressing ratio.  Delicious, fresh croutons.  And shavings of parmesan cheese.  I'm also pretty sure that the dressing contained anchovy paste, and this is as it should be!  YUM! \n\nEveryone that mentions MM to me, says that the Holy Shitake pizza is the best.  I'm a mushroom luvuh, so I took their advice and went with that.  I added bacon to it.  First off, I wanted some meat on my pizza, and secondly...well...bacon makes everything better.  And it's drizzled with a garlic aioli!  Can't go wrong with that.\n\nO.M.G!  This pizza was amazing!  The flavors all went well together and the crust was delicious as well.  \n\nWe also tried the Thai pizza. It was good, but not great. The veggies on the pizza could've been cooked a little more, and overall I expected it to have more of a curry taste.  It also had a sweetness to it.  Too sweet for my taste.  It just didn't seem \"Thai\" at all to me.\n\nI would absolutely go back to Mellow Mushroom.  I will always get the Caesar salad, and I'll always get the mushroom pizza.  Each time I go, I'll also try a different one.  But I have a feeling the Holy Shitake will always remain my favorite.   \n\nI do have to note though...even though I LOVED the Holy Shitake pizza, if I were really in the mood for pizza, it wouldn't satisfy my craving.

We came at around 11:30am, which was perfect, because we beat the big lunch rush.  We were seated within 15 minutes, so we just enjoyed our view of the ocean while we waited.

The half Maine Lobster was super fresh and tender.  The tail was a little chewy, but better than a lot of lobsters I've had lately.  My favorite part was the super meaty claw!  It came out of the shell beautifully with ease, and melted like butter in my mouth.  I didn't even need the side of melted butter!  This dish was simple and sweet.  The Lobster Bisque was good, but nothing I'd be craving.  I hoped that there would be at least a few pieces of lobster in it, but I think they just used lobster for the flavor.  Oh!

The Lobster Roll looked amazing, and it wasn't super drenched in mayo either.  I noticed that my friend didn't eat the roll-- it looked pretty basic/grocery store bought.  It would be nice if they used a buttery, toasted, baguette, as I've seen in other restaurants.  The Rock Crab Claws were fresh and meaty, I must order this one next time.  \n\nOverall, we loved the food and ambiance here-- a perfect ending to our trip! :)", "date": "2015-03-18 17:59:39"}, {"_key": "1794267", "_id": "reviews/1794267", "_rev": "_fNyy1Hm--K", "review_id": "-Tbsvd93P869Hmd0aBmggw", "user_id": "oXYuRa_UDJqcfxfjOPRKxA", "business_id": "QLUUaTj034zYVWiVl9tNvA", "stars": 5, "useful": 3, "funny": 1, "cool": 2, "text": "Love love love this place...this tiny little cafe is right next to a beautiful park and it was a few blocks from our hotel so we decided to drop in.

The sandwich was so cold, I didn't even eat it, and the fries were hotter than the surface of the sun. I took the sandwich home, hoping to heat it up later.\n\nMy wife got the apple and bacon pizza, if you could call it that. She asked for blue cheese on the side, not knowing that it wouldn't come with cheese otherwise. You know, like a normal pizza. And it didn't have some apple, it had, like, a whole apple. Like giant slices over a measly amount of bacon. It was sad, and it made me sad. \n\nI got my Coke refilled ONCE and that's only because Mary pulled a staff member aside to ask her for it.

It looks like they could fit more equipment (weight machines or free weights) on this floor.  Additionally, one room has a really nice set of circuit equipment in it and suspension training equipment in it but it is always occupied by the \"We Fit\" class.  It's a great class and I am sure the members who take it regularly love it but the class is given at 5:30 pm and 6:30 pm eliminating that entire room and all of its equipment during the busiest hours of the gym.  It doesn't make much sense to me to dedicate that room during those busy hours to a very small percentage of members working out.  The equipment in that room would relieve the wait times and overflow in the free weight room and the only other weight circuit.\n \nOverall the gym does the trick and I can get a good workout in.

It was a pretty small cut of cheese, I was definitely hoping for something bigger...I mean they said Opa, that deserves a big wedge of cheese for us to destroy.

It was over a white bean salad. The prawns were a bit of work and the scallops were a bit salty. But overall it was a good entree with a $29.00 price tag. Service was good not great.

This means you've got two options, AutoNation or Crown. Based upon personal experience (this happened to both my brother and husband), if you head to AutoNation first, you'll probably find yourself purchasing from Crown. Here's why. \n\nFrom Service to Sales, They're There to Help.\nIronically, I was helping Mom clean her three-year-old CRV interior. Her New York-dealership lease was up in two months (she moved here two years ago and needed to find a new trusted Honda dealership). Once the interior seats were clean, we were ready to hit the car wash. Boom. The three-year old battery died leaving us stuck in my driveway.\n\nHonda roadside assistance towed the car to the dealership - at no charge of course. Crown offered to replace the battery for free allowing her time to think about her next move. Regardless, I was confident we'd roll out in a new Honda, but didn't want her to worry. She's dealt with Michelle and Brooks in service several times and knows they're both awesome, so having had positive experiences with them helped.\n\nNo Real Pressure. No Real Up-Sell.\nKaren handled our lease deal with management assistance from Vinny. She listened and understood that Mom, a senior, is far from tech savvy - bells and whistles scare her. Mom no longer deals with ice and snow - no need for four-wheel drive and needs to feel comfortable on the road. Her previously-leased 2012 Civic was too tight and too low to the ground. With all of this in mind, they set her up with a standard-feature H-RV crossover vehicle to reach her price point, style and comfort requirements. \n\nJustin Simplifies the Finance Process\nYou've found your ideal car thanks to Sales, now it's time to pay up. Oy, the stress, right? No. Justin puts you at ease with humor, warmth, and banter knowing the stress involved in coughing up the cash. When we told tell him Mom obviously didn't need a top-of-the line coverage plan on a leased car, but only trusts the dealership for service, he worked with her...\n\nReady to Rock and Roll\nRegardless of the dealership closing in thirty minutes, Karen sat with us in Mom's new H-RV and walked her through each and every feature. From actually setting up and testing her iPhone speed dial numbers via bluetooth, to setting up her quick-find favorite soft rock radio stations - every question was answered. I've had this with Volkswagen, but Mom said she's never experienced that with Honda. \n\nOverall Positive Customer Experience \nWe left feeling great about the purchase. We liked getting to know the staffs' personal background - where they're from, details about their families, etc. Enjoyed complimentary cups of tea, coffee, cocoa, and bottled water - car shopping is serious business. We were there for four hours - keeping hydrated is key. Another reviewer said they make you feel like family and honestly, they did. \n\nSweet Sidenote\nCrown apparently loves animals. While out on the lot, we had the pleasure of meeting Oliver, a local orange and white outdoor-cat. Though his owner lives near the dealership, Oliver's made Crown his second home and the crew doesn't seem to mind sharing the outdoor space with him one bit.

I ordered a simple cheeseburger with fries, while my more experienced friends varied with more complex orders. I'm pretty picky with cheeseburgers, fast food or not, and I was pleasantly surprised with the flavor and size of this one. It tasted extremely fresh and the flavors were what I would expect from an approximately $4 burger. The fries were hot and fresh and just the type of texture I love. There was a coupon for a free ice cream on my receipt which I redeemed the same visit. Overall, I had a great experience. It is not someplace I will frequent, just do to the unhealthiness of the options, but not because of the flavor of the food.

So there is one that's only about 9 minutes from where I live and it's connected to a Schnucks. You could do some grocery shopping and finish it up with a refreshing, healthy smoothie. I personally love their Protein Berry Workout smoothie -- a blend of soy milk, strawberries, bananas, and a choice of either soy or whey protein boost. It's pretty much a meal replacement especially if you don't have time to stop and have a hearty breakfast. If you would like a healthier breakfast though, they have some delicious-looking energy bowls. I might try one on my days off.\n\nI have also had their chocolate moo'd smoothie and it was pretty good but that was a long time ago.

Unfortunately, that is not the case, and since my initial review and I've only been back twice. \n\nMy first trip back was for my birthday and it was at least 6 months after my initial visit. I hyped the crap out of the place to my husband and probably set the bar way too high in my own head. As a result, I was a little disappointed. I had the Rotolo which was extraordinary but for whatever reason my Melanzana pizza fell a little flat to me personally. I ended up liking my husband's Salsiccia a little more.\n\nThis past Saturday night, my husband and I were looking for a causal but tasty date night so we decided to head back to Pizzeria Vetri. I took the restaurant off its pedestal and ended up having an exceptional dinner. Funny how that works, right? \n\nSo of course we had to get the Rotolo. I can see why it won a 2014 Best of Philly award. It was light, doughy and pesto perfection. I would still enjoy it without the mortadella and ricotta but that adds an even more flavor. I could probably be a happy camper with a meal of 3-4 Rotolos.\n\nI enjoyed the Salsiccia last time so decided to go for a repeat. It didn't disappoint. Pizzeria Vetri's Instagram page had also tantalized me with pictures of the special pizza of the day, so we had to give it a shot as well. It consisted of broccoli rabe stuffed porchetta, mozzarella, black pepper and pecorino cheese. The ingredients were basic enough for a gourmet pizza but together made for a really great taste. The combination of flavors was a little sharp but in a good way.\n\nThe service has been excellent for each of my three visits. Our servers have always been polite, professional and extremely polished. On our most recent visit the manager stopped by towards the end of our meal to see how we were doing. \n\nI don't love the communal style set-up. While dining out, I prefer the company of my own party. My husband and I have taken to liking to the counter seats that face the open kitchen. I personally found the pizza preparation to be extremely enjoyable to watch and for whatever reason oddly therapeutic and relaxing. \n\nMoral of my update: Pizzeria Vetri serves up some fabulous gourmet pizza but it isn't the best gourmet pizza in the world and certainly not the best atmosphere.

There sometimes is a bit of a language barrier; however most things are labeled and the woman who work there are friendly ans will help you as much as they can.\n\nI always check in on this place when I shop @ H-Mart to see if they have the Spicy Blue Crab soup. Today I lucked out and they had some. There was a woman who was buying like 10 qts. of the stuff. Turns out she is taking back home to Wisconsin to freeze it. You know it's special when folks come from out of state to buy it.\n\nSome of their foods are pretty spicy for occidental palates; but isn't that what Korean food is supposed to be?

We ordered take-out from V Street, then headed next door to Wiz Kid, where I ordered the WK philly (the vegan version of a classic philly cheese steak). We were originally planning on taking this to our hotel to eat the meals from both restaurants but we decided to snag a table at Wiz Kid and eat our food there. The WK philly was ready under 10 minutes, and we self sat in a cute little table where we indulged in all the vegan goodies. I loved that they had regular ketchup and spicy ketchup as options. I went with the spicy and my mom had the regular. We split the hoagie and were both BLOWN away by the flavor. This was the best cheese steak I've ever had. The bun was so tasty, the \"meat\" tasted like real meat but BETTER because I didn't feel disgusting and overly full after I ate it due to the meat sweats and that gross greasy meat feeling in your tum.

It's going to largely be bar cuisine but I find it quite delightful.  I go here not when I'm in the mood for something healthy (though the Paleo Bowl would fulfill that if  you are looking for something healthy) I go here when I went delicious bar food.\n\nIf you like regular nachos, the kind with real melted cheese (not fake cheese sauce), these are some of the best you can get.  They're nothing crazy, no unique twist, just damn good nachos.  If you want fancier nachos, try elsewhere.  But here is going to be one of your best options for straight up regular delicious nachos.  The half portion is more than sufficient for one person.  I cannot even imagine trying to tackle the full portion. I'm a vegetarian so I never get it with beef, but you can totally add a meat option should you wish.\n\nAlso delicious is their mac and cheese.  It's so cheesy, never dried out, and always has some nice cheese melted right on top.  You can get it as a side with many of their burgers, or you can order the entr\u00e9e sized.  And in my opinion, you can never go wrong by adding green chiles to the mac and cheese.  Because green chilis are a gift.\n\nI love their caprese appetizer as well.  Standard mozzarella, tomato, basil, balsamic.  But it's always tasty.  Same with the mozzarella sticks.  Their white bean hummus plate is also delicious.\n\nThe other thing I love about trident is they do what, in my opinion, all restaurants with burgers should do, they say at the top you can take any burger and substitute a veggie patty.  It's baffling to me how many places don't even offer a veggie burger at all (they're frozen!  not that hard to keep them stocked!) or if they do, they're hesitant or unwilling to accommodate a request to add it to a different burger than the one veggie burger listed on the menu.  Why in the world, if you already have veggie patties on hand, do I have to order the ONE veggie burger you have listed?  Why can't I just substitute the veggie patty onto any other option?  It drives me bonkers.  But for Trident, this is never the case!  The mushroom swiss looks good to you?  They'll make it with a veggie patty.  The green chile burger looks great?  They'll make it a veggie.  Etc., etc., etc.  It's a standard Boca Burger, which are ok.  Normally I avoid Boca Burgers, but Trident makes me excited to eat a veggie burger!  I recommend the Green Chile with a Boca Burger, and add a fried egg.  Side salad and no bun if you want low carb.  Or, if you're indulging, side of mac & cheese.\n\nFor non-vegetarians, my friends are always happy to eat here too.  Popular choices among my friends include the grilled shrimp skewers, the non-veggie burgers, the crispy shrimp po-boy, and the paleo bowl.\n\nThey also have a fully stocked bar.  Good prices on their beverages.  And the wait staff has always been friendly and kind.\n\nWord of caution, if there's football on, it's probably going to be crowded here.

Being that we all prefer to eat healthy, I figured this would be a fun place for us to try.  We came at 8am, opening hour, and ordered some coffees and homemade chai teas with almond milk.  Both the coffee and teas were delicious - this is nothing like a packaged, made from concentrate or powder chai.. it is real deal tea brewed with herbs and spices, and topped with frothed almond milk and cinnamon.  Perfection!  \n\nAs the restaurant was pretty quiet at that hour, we lingered, enjoyed our beverages and got some work done.  We ordered breakfast about an hour later.  They had the regular menu plus a menu of mothers day specials.  I opted for the asparagus frittata special with fruit.  The frittata was more of a quiche than a typically frittata, but the large slice of fritatta pie was absolutely delicious and indulgent!  A potato crush, mashed potato consistency on the inside and crispy on the outside, held in layers of creamy eggs, lots of cheese and some veggies on top.  It was plenty filling and the fruit cup was a nice balance. \n\nWe sat for another hour, working away, and felt no pressure to vacate the table, but instead were met with fresh coffee and ice waters every 30 minutes or so.

We figured we should get 2 slices for the table, when really we all could have shared one!  It was AMAZING - seriously, you've never had strawberry pie like this before!  The crust was flaky but dense in a delicious par-baked sugar cookie kind of way - it was delish!  The strawberries were fresh and had made a nice syrup inside the pie, not too sweet, but so flavorful.  The pie was topped with fresh whipped cream which made the decadent pie even more divine.  \n\nAround noon, we started noticing that the small restuarant was filling up and decided since we had lingered and enjoyed our experience all morning that it was probably time to go and let them fill our table with other customers.

It came with a green salad sprinkled with feta, rice, huge beef kabobs, more pita and more hummus - I probably could have skipped the appetizer hummus but oh well. Our server had asked me how I wanted my beef cooked, medium rare, and it came out perfectly medium rare (You never really know). It was also very tender and juicy. I picked at my bf's gyro plate and it was sooo good! The other couple we were with also really enjoyed their food. One of our friends ordered a vegetarian plate, so it's nice that they offer vegetarian options.\n\nMust go back to sample the grape leaves and falafel. My eyes were bigger than my stomach and I really wanted to order these but there's absolutely no way I would have been able to finish it all.

The bar was set very high as I heard lots of great buzz about Nox but on this visit it missed just a little for me. \n\nThe service was best part of the night, top notch staff, server was very professional, responsive and on his game.  The staffs attire, friendliness, demeanor, etc. all are a perfect compliment to the concept and enhance the experience.    \n\nWe started with the poblano soup and although it had a great flavor it wasn't at the appropriate serving temperature, it came out tepid, lukewarm.  And the soup was served fast so its not like it was sitting around waiting to be served.  Miss. \n\nFor entrees the wife got the salmon and I had the burger.  I wasn't totally in the mood for a burger but In my opinion when a burger is on the menu at a place like this you expect it to be amazing but it fell flat for me. It was overcooked, (ordered medium rare) and it was almost well done.  It had good flavors and I am sure it would have been better had it came out medium-medium rare. Bacon and cheese were nothing special and the pretzel bun was too dry and I tossed it after a couple bites.  I also can't eat much, bun and all, so that is probably on me as burger probably eats better with the bun on every bite.  The fries were good but nothing special.  Had to ask for an aioli to fun it up and the chipotle aioli was tasty.\n\nThe wife's salmon was tasty, loved the chili flavors and brussel sprouts, different enough from the usual salmon dish so that one scored big.  Was a little overcooked though. Was too full for desert but maybe next time.\n\nA suggestion on a way they could improve upon the experience is making better use of the space and decor in the back.  The place has a great ambiance when you walk in but it loses everything in the back where we were seated. I would like to see better decor in the back and you have to do something with that big empty space in the middle.  I know its a weird shape back there but need to get some fung shway going. Our table was against the wall and then next to us a huge empty space with visibility into all the server areas.  And a big plant that the servers bumped into every time they went back there. There is also a a very awkward 2 top in the corner along the bench seating.  \n\nI am picturing consolidating the server stations to one in the very back and putting in two big butchers block tables and seat family style.  And/or wrap the bar around and create some fun seating out of that like a breakfast bar/nook with just one butcher block.  \n\nI think the decision makers could get some great ideas from this place http://holeman-finch.com/ it reminded me of what Nox could be.  Same deal they are in a strip mall with a weird shaped space.  It would seriously be worth a quick trip to Atlanta to check it out and have a great dining experience while there.

I went with shrimp, my husband mixed it up with fish and shrimp. Lemme break it down: \n\nTortillas: Fresh, handmade, substantial without being dense. Impossibly moist and flexible. How are these not crumbling apart in my hand? This is a tortilla that can stand up to some serious manhandling, which is exactly what I did to my tacos. I would like to note that I would manhandle these on their own as a snack, or filled with cheese and green chiles. \n\nShrimp: Crispy until the end. Moderately battered. I won't say lightly - someone's dragging these through the batter with a heavyish hand, but I'm happy to say they're cooked perfectly and thoroughly enough that you don't encounter any flavorless globs of doughy disappointment. Just pure, deep fried ecstasy. \n\nSauce: White sauce of indeterminable origin. Mayonnaise? Vinegar? Crema? DELICIOUS. Cooly, tangy, and sour in the best way possible. Really the great unifier - bringing together while still accentuating the hot, crispy, shrimp, crunchy cabbage, and dense corn tortilla. \n\nBeans & Rice: Solid. Substantial. You're going to eat them. \n\nHorchata: Dude said people show up just for the horchata and I believe him. This doesn't come out of a fountain, and I'm not just saying that because I watched as it got ladled out of some giant tub resting on the counter top. You can taste the rice. This drink has texture, and what appears to be giant, lovely flecks of cinnamon bark. \n\nPina/Mango Juice: Fortifying. So tasty. Chunks of fresh pineapple.

If you're a foodie and/or a hipster, forgo the meat and three and BBQ and meander over to East Nashville for a dining experience. Here's why I loved Butcher & Bee:\n\n1) The food- It's a small plate concept with the majority of dishes being vegetable based (though they do have some meat options). My friend and I ordered four small plates and a dessert to share and we left content. A few stand outs: The whipped feta is their signature. It is good, but if you don't like feta to begin with, order something else. Avocado crispy rice- It's more salad with a whole avocado mixed in and crunch North Carolina rice. Butternut squash soup- Bold flavors with a pomegranate seed garnish. Meat balls- comes in a triad and has cheese and bread crumbs mixed in. The chocolate pot de creme with chili was good, but not sweet (In case you're obsessed with sugar like me).\n\n2) The atmosphere- It's slick and the simple art around the restaurant is perfectly placed. We sat at the small table in front of their logo painted on the wall and several Instagrammers stopped by to snap a photo. Warning: The light is low so it doesn't make for the best photos.\n\n3) The location- It's just off of Main Street in East Nashville within walking distance to other Nashville finds like Edley's BBQ and Family Wash. \n\n4) The service- It's the South so it was friendly, but not in a fake or annoying way.\n\nIf you want a good Nashville dining experience that's on the cutting edge of Nashville's food scene pivot, go to Butcher and Bee. Just don't Google it because you'll find it's NOT a local joint (It's from Charleston, South Carolina).", "date": "2017-10-05 04:56:23"}, {"_key": "1797733", "_id": "reviews/1797733", "_rev": "_fNyy1Ry--K", "review_id": "B__mx7kewtcoUk4f_YKjHQ", "user_id": "ET3TgSSQ3shm2mj5vZ8IVQ", "business_id": "1UNorskttXSWuEcgzKzXcA", "stars": 4, "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "Hanging out in Society Hill rarely happens for me, due to the saturation of wonderful bars and restaurants in my own neighborhood, but the urging of multiple friends and a birthday party finally brought me over to \"So-Cheet\" last night.\n\nWe hung out in the cozy, dark basement lounge, which was pretty great.

Good thing I got the last one of the season. \n\nThis sort of event is always a lot of fun, as it really shows off the small but growing food truck scene present in our city.  It's a great chance to showcase what they've got and get exposure.  It is especially nice to have gatherings like this since it seems we rarely see the trucks just around town during the week, and I love the opportunity to browse the selections and grab some various random things to munch on.\n\nIf you've experienced Food Truck Fridays, then you know the drill.  A bunch of trucks parked together, you choose the ones that strike your fancy, and spend the rest of your time hanging out and enjoying yourselves.  Feed the Camel, occurring on Hump Days throughout the summer, is a much smaller-scale affair hosted down by the river at the McKinley Arts Center.  The trucks are parked under and around the Keystone Bridge, and attendees can grab their food and drinks then find a table or nice grassy spot on the lawn.  It's a nice way to break up the week, and let some other trucks who may not be at the Friday festivities show their stuff, too.  There tend to be far fewer people at this event than Food Truck Fridays, so parking access is easier, the lines are shorter, and the entire atmosphere is way more laid back and chill.  Occasionally there will be music or other activities here, as well.  Such as tonight, with Archie from the baseball team entertaining the kids.\n\nThe selections run the gamut of variety.  From hot dogs to brisket sandwiches, vegan to hot wings, tacos to corn dogs.  Even with only about a dozen trucks and stalls present, you get a really good range to choose from.  I ended up with some Latin-Asian fusion rice balls from a new truck, a great chorizo hot dog from Bam Dogs, washed it down with slushy drink from the Mr. Margarita, and topped it off with a scoop of gelato from Bibos.  It was certainly an eclectic evening, and browsing through the menus at each place is half the fun.  Prices range from a few bucks and go upwards from there depending on what you get and how much of it.  Most all places take cards, but bringing cash just makes things way faster and easier all around.\n\nIf you haven't been this year, put it on your calendar for next summer.

It's finally here!\n\nI'm not sure why I was expecting a small shop, the corner unit is expansive with numerous seating areas. Catching up with a friend is ideal on the couch and in front of the fireplace; or perhaps a small table to set up a work- or study-space; or if you'd like to chat to co-owner Kristy (nicknamed Shammy by friends and family), sit alongside the bar and watch her make up your coffee.\n\nSince I entered through the 76th Avenue entrance, the first thing that caught my eye was the \"Take a Book, Leave a Book\" shelf space, already filled to the brim with all kinds of reads. Next, the incredible reclaimed wood pieces from local Alberta farms, up-cycled as art and decor to display the Woodrack Caf\u00e9's homemade jewelry, antler art, and boho crafts which are all also for sale. Up-cycled wine glasses, mugs handmade in Victoria, if you like it, it's probably for sale!\n\nRounding up to the main entrance and counter, I got pretty excited to see a display case full of whoopie pies and with fall-inspired flavours to boot. Who wouldn't want a pumpkin pie, carrot cake, or chai whoopie to go along with their drink? The crazies that's who. Their menu online also states that puddings (dark chocolate salted, rice puddings, and bread puddings) will be available, as well as treats like duffins (so help me if spellcheck doesn't let that one through, it's a doughnut and a muffin having a delicious baby), brookies (a brownie with a big spoon of cookie dough!), and butter tarts. The amount of cross-breeding between pastries is enough to get you wide-eyed and drooling, all thanks to in-house chef Tracy, or Mama T.\n\nCo-owner Melissa was up front and center manning the front when I visited last Wednesday. With a background in business, the new development space was a perfect (but challenging) match for them to open up shop. Set out to launch in summer 2015, construction and tailoring the space for the kitchen became the main cause of their delay. I'd like to say though that it was all worth it, the open concept kitchen inviting and the details of the tin-tiled ceilings and wood-paneled floors all coming together to create a warm space.\n\n\nAlongside the whoopie pies and assorted pastries, The Woodrack Caf\u00e9 is serving up two kinds of brews, local Edmonton roast ACE Coffee Roasters and one all the way from the east coast, Anchored Coffee from Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. Having never tried Anchored Coffee before, I'm excited to try the lighter brew next time I'm in Woodrack! For last week's visit, I opted for one of their espresso-based drinks instead. The Danesi Caff\u00e8 (Rome, Italy) latte is always a sure way to go!\n\nOatmeal and soups are available for now but Woodrack hopes to add sandwiches and heartier meals as they ease their way into things. Currently their hours are Monday to Friday 7:30am to 4:30pm, with goals of extending their hours to 7pm to accommodate the after-work crowd and weekends. Baby steps for now, but I'm hopeful it will happen soon.\n\nWith only a few days tucked underneath their belts, it was a pleasant surprise to see the space full of people and from different walks of life, a concept true to what Kristy and Melissa had wanted. They hope to bring people in, and stay in, never feeling rushed and pressured to leave. Fostering a sense of community is, in all honesty, one of the measures of success for a caf\u00e9! By the looks of how things were going, I could tell this wasn't a grab-and-go kind of space. You can also tell that The Woodrack Caf\u00e9 had thought this through, there's built-in plug-ins at the counter!\n\nIf you've been following me, you'll know that I am always excited for a new caf\u00e9 and quadruply (not a word, I know) as happy when it's a local business supporting local products and art! I also love spaces where I can relax, order a drink and a bite to eat (every hour, of course!), and type away willy-nilly on my laptop. Here's to another fantastic space and to the expansion of Edmonton's coffee culture! Can't wait to come back to The Woodrack Caf\u00e9 check out their menu expansions and a new brew. I'm also crossing my fingers that there will be a duffin or brookie waiting for me. Or even a tarduffin.

Now it's time to review the main vehicle of that vacation: Carnival Cruise Lines....\n\nI have to say that I'm pretty disappointed in carnival.  There are a variety of reasons why and I'll attempt to illustrate them fully below:\n\n1 - They charge you for Soda.   Yeah I know.  I mean seriously? Soda is like the cheapest thing in the world and you have the gall to charge me like 3 bucks for can of Coke?  Get off me.  Sure you have an \"unlimited plan\" but you'd need to drink soda like me in college to get your money's worth.\n\n2 - Diamonds International. It's really sad to me that Carnival has either purchased land or worked with each of the ports to create an identical mall at each port that contains not 1, not 2, but 3 freaking Diamonds Internationals at each location.  Then they drop you off and effectively hold you hostage in these cookie cutter malls shoving \"cheap\" jewelry, souveniers and lots of other \"americanized shit\" into your face.  I didn't go Cozumel to get a t-shirt from Ron Jon Surf Shop, get a drink at Fat Tuesdays and buy diamonds.  I went to experience local culture and to lay on a beach.\n\n3 - Shore Excursions. Much like above, the cruise line makes it difficult for you to do anything without the purchase of a \"shore excursion\".    This includes laying on the beach.  Shockingly, at every port we are far away from the beach and to get there you generally need to take local transportation and/or buy an \"excursion\".  The excursion costs like $50 a person.  For the beach.  I mean cmon.  I'd say that's a bit overkill.  Can I go to a local taxi and get there?  Generally yeah, but guess what?  Those dudes know that your only alternative is a $50 excursion and they price themselves accordingly.  Oh and most excursions start at 8 am. Totally not my thing.\n\n4 - Food.  I'll be honest, I wasn't impressed.  They have a ton of variety and the buffets and main dining room have reasonable hours.  But the buffet wasn't as good as a nice Casino Buffet and the dining room food felt like food from an overly-produced wedding reception.  The steak house was \"ok\".  My jaunt over to Elways at Cherry Creek here in Denver with Ladyhawk for our anniversary was 10 times better on a pure food level.\n\nSo at this point you must be saying, \"geez Nick, you didn't enjoy yourself on vacation!\"  You'd be wrong.  I loved spending a week relaxing, playing cards, reading and exploring new places with my wonderful wife.  It was a blast.  I'll even try a cruise again someday, just not with Carnival.  \n\nThe hidden gem in our excursions and searching?  Isla Roatan in Honduras.  That place is very beautiful and Anthony's Key Resort on that island is a place I'll go back to sometime.

This acai bowl includes a base made of acai, banana, strawberries, and hemp milk. The bowl is topped with sliced banana, chopped strawberries, blueberries, goji berries, bee pollen and granola, plus a honey drizzle if you want. It's already sweet enough so the honey isn't necessary. I added peanut butter to mine for a protein kick and more flavor. I enjoyed the bowl itself, although it takes some work to get down to the actual acai base in the to-go cup. I would have liked a few more berries too. The granola itself is kind of meh... not bad but not great. For the price ($13 to $14 after tax and tip) I think the bowl should have been a little better. Again, don't get me wrong, it was good overall. If you're hungry and can put away a decent amount of food, you should be able to finish the large.

There was a strong taste of citrus which I am not a fan of. I was unable to eat the dish and sent it back. Two people ordered shrimp and grits. The grits had no seasoning, had no taste of butter and had a lumpy consistency that we all disliked. Someone ordered the mango chutney grilled cheese. It looked fantastic but his response was that it was blah. We had a child with us who ordered silver dollar pancakes. Instead of smaller kid friendly pancakes 3 larger pancakes were served. Two people ordered the yogurt parfait. It said it was layered with strawberry compote but instead it was fresh strawberries, blueberries and a sprinkling of granola. The oddest food preparation to me was the side of scrapple someone ordered. It came deep fried. I'm a scrapple connoisseur. I have never seen scrapple served like this. It should be on the menu if it isn't going to be prepared as it usually is.

I like my grits a bit, well, grittier.\n\nBeyond the grits, they have lots of other breakfast foods, including some good sandwiches with sausage, eggs, etc.\n\nIt's a big cafe, with plenty of tables, large and small.  The staff seems to support the fact that lots of people like to settle in and hang out a while.  This gives a good cafe a pub feel, and Edgehill has a good bit of this.\n\nIf you've not been here, check it out and let us all know what you think.", "date": "2014-02-12 15:19:36"}, {"_key": "1799783", "_id": "reviews/1799783", "_rev": "_fNyy1X6--F", "review_id": "vi1XPASJucai9lvyTJeObA", "user_id": "WF-sXnGO0W1gG_iSMXYX2w", "business_id": "2brttsiFBlW8070dsPzQDA", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Really liked this place. \n\nIt was a bit busy as it was a Sunday morning when we visited so I feel like our waitress was a bit overwhelmed however, the food was so good.

And do carbs ever disappoint? Personally, not at IHOP. It's one of my top 5 places for comfort food. Just gimme a big stack of those old-fashioned buttermilk pancakes and lay on the syrup! Yeah, I'm an easy girl to please, but don't tell anyone else that.\n\nI have and always will love pancakes. And I always used to lament that Edmonton paled in comparison to Vancouver (Burnaby specifically) because we did not have an IHOP. (There's something odd when you don't much care about the ocean and the mountains but more for pancakes) So when the fiance and I were driving back from the airport one night on Calgary Trail, I gasped and found myself literally unable to speak after seeing the billboard announcing that IHOP was finally coming to Edmonton. My fiance was freaked out of his mind, as he thought there was something wrong as he was driving.\n\nNo matter what time of day it is, morning, noon or evening, I will exercise my right to have pancakes. So naturally, my first meal here was a dinner of pancakes. That's normal enough, right? If you're a fellow pancake-lover and have a sweet tooth, I recommend getting the Tooti-Fruiti (I'm so not making that name up), which comes with strawberry pieces and strawberry sauce drizzled on top. If your sugar tastebuds don't rule your mouth, go for a combination instead. You can choose your type of pancakes and throw them together with the classic side choices of bacon, sausage links, eggs, or hashbrowns. I'm going to be honest and admit their scrambled eggs are not so great --they're pretty much some kinda pre-mixed egg liquid they pour into the frying pan and stir up, i.e. not fresh.\n\nBut you don't go to IHOP for the eggs! You go for the pancakes ... they're not called The International House of Pancakes for nothing! If you plan on going, avoid Sunday afternoons as it is mayhem. We attempted going one Sunday around 1:30 PM and the waiting area was packed. One woman walked out muttering, \"It's not worth it.\" So be forewarned!

As soon as I moved to Indianapolis, I looked for the restaurants in the evening and this was the only place which offer dinner buffet. I dropped in this place for dinner with my friend and needless to say, the restaurant was smelling all curry and I loved the aroma. They were still setting up the dishes for the dinner buffet but they told us to grab the plates and hog on! We were like Hell Yeah !! Let's do it !\n\nThe items on the buffet were great. I think it was a huge spread but it's quite common if you drop into an Indian restaurant for buffet. There was two kinds of soup - chicken soup and tomato soup which I didn't try. I always recommend people to stay away from soups at Indian restaurants. Moving on.. There was my favorite South Indian food - Vada [ pro tip: they look like small donuts but they are not sweet] , and they were awesome, I had almost 10 of them. There were four kinds of chutneys, every chutney was perfect. They had delicious sambar too.  [pro tip : you generally have Vada's with chutney and sambar. Especially coconut chutney] They had Potato fry [aloo fry], egg plant curry, panner makhani [paneer butter masala], veg Manchurian and couple more vegetarian dishes. They all were fantastic.\n\nComing to the non- vegetarian section, they have chicken makhani [chicken butter masala], lamb curry, tandoori chicken, chicken dum biryani. I didn't try the lamb curry but the chicken dum biryani was great. [pro tip: add some chicken makhani to your chicken biryani rice and have it, it's so yummy]. The tandoori chicken was not so great. I don't understand why several Indian restaurants get this dish wrong. They add plenty of food color which spoils the taste of the dish and make it look red and dark pink in color. It's ridiculous. Please get this right!! \n\nThey had carrot halwa, couple of ice creams and fresh cut fruits in the desserts section. \n\nThey serve any kind of naan and roti and Dosa's at your table if you tell the server. [pro tip: Dosa is a South Indian dish and they look little like pan cakes and some people even refer them as Indian pan cakes. And again they are not sweet like pan cakes.

The pickles come with thick slices of bread, the most luxurious butter-like dairy product (It seems too good to be butter, yet it's obviously not margarine and is probably just really good butter), and tapenade. I especially love their beet pickles.\n\nI have also gone to Village Whiskey a few times for cocktails. While I believe they are typically full on weekend evenings, I have never had a problem finding a seat on a weeknight or after dining hours on a weekend. The cocktails are well-crafted.\n\nSo to sum it up, over-the-top burgers and fries (good or bad depending on your preference), fantastic pickles, and solid cocktails!", "date": "2016-11-11 22:10:06"}, {"_key": "1800301", "_id": "reviews/1800301", "_rev": "_fNyy1ZS--R", "review_id": "pRZe_PjSuLM00NjrL0HIyw", "user_id": "l2JpmmYO-5OXSYehBvTfcQ", "business_id": "XwPKw3mw214qDxJFfX-pgg", "stars": 5, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "We love Mamma Maria's!

Chicken (mild or spicy) - We went with mild. So tender, perfectly spiced and yummy!\nCourse 4. Beef kebab or lamb - We couldn't decide so our waiter let us try both! While I did enjoy the taste of the beef, it was too tough and hard to chew. The lamb is cooked with honey and almonds so I didn't think I'd enjoy it that much (meat + sweet aren't my favorite combo) but I loved it! It didn't taste too gamey and the meat fell right off the bone...mm, perfection. \nCourse 5. Couscous with vegetables, chickpeas and raisins - It was good but I was so deep in my food coma that I don't remember much about this dish. I didn't love the addition of raisins though.\nCourse 6. Bowl of assorted fruit - I love ending any meal with fresh fruit, but I wish they had been cut up. This was literally just a giant bowl of fruit, like apples, oranges, grapes and bananas. There was so much variety but at that point I had no desire to peel an orange or deal with a whole apple. Call me lazy but I would've much preferred to eat a smaller portion of a fruit salad or something.\nCourse 7. Baklava and mint tea - I don't really like baklava in general, but this was really good. And the mint tea was the best I've ever had. We had a few cups of that before we headed out!\n\nOur waiter was really attentive but didn't hover around or rush us.

Every time I eat here the food has just been really disappointing and I consider myself pretty lenient when it comes to mexican food. I mean I'll eat almost anything. And I know I can't be the only one who feels unsatisfied by this place because I'm not even a terribly picky reviewer. \n\nMy top Mexican go-to list are usually: Carreta's Grill, Juan's Flying Burrito or Superior Grill. But I wanted to try something new. I've really TRIED to like this place. I have visited Casa Garcia maybe 3 times in the past year because it had this great reputation but I felt so disappointed every time and wanted to keep giving it another shot thinking maybe I was ordering the wrong things somehow. The queso is some sort of watered down cheese substance (and not like in a hot cheese kind of way, you could literally pour this stuff into your coffee like its a bowl of cream), the chili relleno had the same cheese inside it so that sort of turned me off, nachos are always soupy and soggy (even right when they get to the table), the fajitas are small, the rice is stale. I don't know I mean I just don't get anything out of this place and I happen to LOVE Mexican food! \n\nA friend of mine always gets the enchiladas and he swears by it so maybe that's what you need to get there. But I'd hate to try it for the fourth time only to be further disappointed. \n\nNot to mention the sanitation problem this place seems to have. You can tell they don't clean much, which to be fair, isn't some big requirement for me. There's plenty of hole in the wall shady looking places with great food right? But what I CAN'T ignore is the extremely dirty silverware. I mean there were GIANT obnoxious unmissable amounts of food caked onto my fork and knife from the last person. It looked like they didn't even bother soaking it in some hot sanitized water before throwing it in the dishwasher and baking it right on there. It was pretty gross. I jacked the silverware from the next table over but found the same thing. It took browsing through 3 different sets to find a suitable fork. I mean....c'mon that's just disturbing on so many levels....\n\nThe only reason this place really even gets 2 stars is because I've always had a pleasant experience if I JUST sit at the bar and drink a margarita. Their happy hour (2-4-1 margaritas) is a pretty solid deal and the complementary bean and salsa dip that comes with the chips are actually surprisingly decent! The bartender has always been really friendly and knowledgable about tequilas and we have a nice chat.\n\nHowever, you basically NEED to go visit the bar and drink your sorrows away after encountering the food there....\n\nSorry Casa Garcia, but we just aren't compatible. Maybe I'll come back for a happy hour special once in a blue moon but that's about all I can give you :-(", "date": "2014-07-31 22:34:27"}, {"_key": "1800873", "_id": "reviews/1800873", "_rev": "_fNyy1cG--Q", "review_id": "B2n-dZ0EL-H3ZNTgNKqjqQ", "user_id": "Nw8xEp7xxcWBn3OHZhrz3A", "business_id": "Q-prSTdggNlxAEFV88BZOw", "stars": 5, "useful": 2, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "text": "This place was AMAZING.

Our server was astounding - attentive to the correct degree, personable and happy to provide recommendations/pairings with our orders. We opted to order several small plates and share.\n\nFirst - Poached Black Mission Figs - so savory and delicious! And I'm not even a big blue cheese fan, but these were perfect. Then we had two of the Bruchettas - Truffled Mushroom with Fontina and Brie de Nangis with Allagash Cherries. Both were really tasty and paired well with the wines recommended by the server. The only potential downside here is that they were fairly simple in construction - we could easily recreate this at home. Then we had the Smoked Duck and Spinach Salad which was just delightful. Again, I'm not the biggest pistachio fan, but they really did add something special to this salad. Finally, we split the Warm Apple Bread Pudding which was a lovely taste of fall.\n\nUnlike some of the other trendy places we visited in Philly, we never felt rushed -- so many other spots the staff seemed like they were just trying to turn over your table.

The surrounding shops are a bit suspect, and the area isn't one of the better ones in the city.  This is where my complaining is going to stop.  Once you walk into the doors, the staff are usually very good about greeting you.  The sliding door to the beer cooler is immediately on the right.  Bring your warm coat, it's cold in the cooler.  \n\nThe cooler is chock a block full of beer, some wine and sake.  The space between the shelving is very narrow, and usually there isn't enough room to even get past someone else.  The shelves are floor to over 6 ft and full of various beers.  They have done a pretty good job of grouping the different beers (ie: local, seasonal, pilsners, fruit/flavour, etc.)  There are a few tags on the various beers in each section that highlight staff picks and hidden gems.  Which is always welcome, as you get to try something that someone else thinks is a winner.  \n\nThe remainder of the liquor store (the heated part) isn't as crammed as the beer cooler, but still offers up a fairly big selection of different spirits and wines.  \n\nOverall, Sherbrooke is going for uniqueness and not quantity.  The beer selection is by far the best in the city.  They also have a very nice selection of wines and spirits.  Some of the spirits can be had for less, if you are going for the more common ones, the ones that can be found elsewhere.

It is so well designed, there is hardly a bad seat in the house. Even the ones in the pavilion take my breath away. And I love, love, love how the city is framed in the outfield. \n\nThe stadium is located in South Philly, wayyyy down there, away from downtown. It is nice because people can tailgate, which is like a great anthropological discovery for someone from a city whose stadium is right downtown. You can come early? And cook burgers? And drink beer? And you don't have do it at a bar? Fascinating! \n\nI was pleasantly surprised to discover the games feel shorter when you watch them at the stadium. I think this has a lot to do with the fact that the fans are kept entertained, even in the lull between innings. Plus the Phanatic has an effing hot dog bazooka! Come the hell on! But seriously, even if you don't know a thing about baseball, you will not be bored.\n\nThe tickets are relatively cheap for a professional sporting event, although they have become more difficult to obtain since the Phillies won the world series. Prior to this season, I used to be able to get decent seats the same week of the game without using a reseller. This is just what happens when your team kicks some serious ass, I suppose.\n\nThank god they have decent beer here. Seriously. Brewerytown carries Victory on tap and Dogfish Head in bottles. Since Prima Pils is my favorite pilsner, that makes me first a happy lady... then a drunk lady, despite the $7 price tag.\n\nIn addition to real beer, there is real food! There are even vegetarian options other than fries and pretzels. At my last game, I tried a cheesesteak from Tony Luke's. It was bready, but certainly nowhere near the worst I've ever had. Someone caught a ball about 10 seats down from me and THANK GOD the camera did not pull out enough to catch me scarfing that thing down. My dignity is still intact for the moment. \n\nFinally, I have read a few reviews that say Phillies fans are violent assholes, but I have to disagree. Passionate? Definitely. Are there a few bad seeds? Of course, there always are. Believe me, I come from drunken, violent, asshole fan MECCA. If there is anything I am an expert in, it is perhaps this topic.

Previous businesses in this location haven't fared too well in the past, but it's been an encouraging sight to see the community love and support Soy Teryaki Bistro since its commencement in 2010. Although I moved to Atlanta five years ago, I still remain a big fan of the restaurant and consider it to be one of my favorite places to eat whenever I visit Nashville, so I wanted to share a quick review. \n\nI took a look at the menu online to see if anything has changed since my last visit; other than one or two items, I've tried every item on their menu (yes, every single appetizer, salad, fried rice, soup and teriyaki). My favorites were always the spicy fried rice, soy green salad, shrimp tacos and beef teriyaki. What really sticks out, beyond the great flavors or ingredients of the fried rice and salad, is the sauces that they're served alongside. The soy green salad comes with a creamy avocado ranch dressing while the spicy fried rice is served with a creamy, spicy sauce. All are made fresh in-house and are the perfect complements to both dishes. I still find myself craving them and wishing I had a bottle with me so I could put it on my meals here in Atlanta. If you want a lighter option, I loved ordering the soy green salad with salmon - so good! The teriyaki options are all delicious, but I'm a big fan of beef, so I loved ordering the beef teriyaki; the meat is always tender and the sauce has the perfect balance of sweet and savory, without being overly salty or overpowering the meat. If you're not as hungry and want something smaller to snack on, you should check out the tacos. Or if you're just feeling in a taco mood, 3 of these would be a perfect meal; each taco comes served in a corn tortilla with the teriyaki meat, spicy slaw and drizzled with house sauce. My favorite is the shrimp taco, but all the other options are tasty as well. \n\nI'm normally not a fan of fusion-inspired food, but I love that Soy keeps true to their Korean roots and finds an updated yet refined way to serve every meal with well-balanced flavor. \nThe owners, Chris and Hanna, are two of the friendliest and generous people I've had the pleasure of knowing. They run their business with persistence, sincerity and kindness. I loved being in the restaurant and seeing them greet customers by name or remember a 'regular' order - they make it a goal to truly treat you like family.

Taste-wise, my medium-rare burger with goat cheese and egg is comparable to BBP or 500 Degrees. The meat and egg were prepared the way I like it, and the toppings were of high quality, especially the cheese. (Note that the egg yolk is runny! If you don't like that or are afraid of salmonella, let them know.) The only thing I did not like as much was how heavily the hamburger buns were buttered. That was just a little bit too much for my taste, but I know many people who would love the slightly sweet, buttery bun. However, the burger I got was 16 dollars (11 for the burger, 3.50 for the cheese and 1.50 for the egg), which is exactly the price of the burger at Craigie on Main.

At VW, we had to order French fries for 5 dollars on the side, which were delicious and came with a well-spiced ketchup.\n\nI like the atmosphere of the place, and the location which made seating outside more pleasant than at BBP's right on Walnut Street. The service also was excellent (very much unlike BBP). The staff appears professional, they are attentive and fill up your water very regularly.\n\nAll in all, it's a 3.5 - the good burger, atmosphere and service warrant a high rating, but the extraordinarily high price (for what you get) is rather a downer, and I can't give 4 stars to a place where I am unsure whether I'd want to come back. I do like the concept of letting the customer choose their own toppings, which allowed me to choose a combination of toppings you never see but I personally enjoy. On the other hand, the menu of this place is largely uninspired and boring, which in turn is Bobby's Burger Palace's strongest point. If you are in the area, this is probably the highest quality burger + fries you can get - but it comes at a steep price.", "date": "2012-06-26 18:57:00"}, {"_key": "1801688", "_id": "reviews/1801688", "_rev": "_fNyy1eq--_", "review_id": "DQMnksvuSt9FPpyM5vpMlg", "user_id": "x1_sp_rHxZtI8VLX_IF5cw", "business_id": "AfassS1QI0DHsqwuof9-lA", "stars": 4, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I was introduced to Dirty Franks just a couple days ago.

The seared tuna was okay but didn't appear to be a high grade tuna. The texture of the meat wasn't what I expected but the flavor was still good. Maybe it was that I'm more used to sushi grade tuna and it isn't sliced as thick as the tuna at Pita Jungle.\n\nBut the baklawa  (baklawa? I guess it's both baklawa and baklava according to Wikipedia...hopefully I haven't offended anyone over the years with improper pronunciation) was amazingly flaky and delicious.

I can only speak for myself, so first of all, all of our food came out HOT, the buns are made in-house and were delicious.  super tasty, nicely toasted and crispy yet soft - i wanted to take some home with me.  The combination of the goat cheese and bacon with the burger was perfect.  I loved it.  It did not need anything else.  I did put some of the chipotle sauce that came with our fries (separate purchase) and it was pretty good, but not necessary.  Burgers were a pretty good size - they were smaller than the bun, but still a good size.  Worth the price?  Sure, this was a quality burger!  My only gripe, however is that the price did not include fries (see below).\n\nNo one left a morsel on their plates.  My son's friend ate so fast we actually thought he was a little strange...no one should eat that fast...\n\nSides:  We ordered two large french fries ($4 each) to share between four people and it was exactly enough.  You have a choice of \"sauces.\"   I was not impressed at all - they were just fries, and honestly with burgers starting at about $8 these fries should come with the burgers.  I need to have french fries with my burger, so I will pay every time, but suggest that they re-think this item and make them worth the price and at least make something worth the price like  garlic fries.  These are NOT worth the extra $2-$4.\n\nWe also had the Cheese Curds - ok not what I was expecting but it was good.  Not sure what kind of cheese it was but it went really well with the mustard and apples - the bread/crackers however were a nightmare almost funny - they crumbled because they were so thin!  Almost like lace.  They really should be a little thicker.  Again, it was good, but c'mon please be a little more generous with the thickness of the bread/cracker.  \n\nThe boys had ice cream, but I won't comment because I did not taste it.

I went because of him and watched him consume a huge platter of pulled pork. I was a little daunted but I ordered The Cure, which I had to admit I thoroughly enjoyed. Fried egg, amazing waffles, pulled pork, bacon (which I even ate!), some sort of sweet sauce, flavor, flavor, more flavor and sweet potato fries. So good.\n\nSo we went again.

The coolest part (as always) was the tasting at the end of the tour. We tried their Oktoberfest, Summer Lager, Export IPA and lastly (by request of another tour member), their Coffee Stout. The Coffee Stout was delish and my sister's favorite out of the ones we tried. The tasting was super chill and casual, very intimate with our small tour group all of which I enjoyed.

Originally, we tried to get into Farmhaus (my other fave resto in STL) totally last minute and were told we could either dine outside (in 102 degree weather?  Huh-uh.) or come in at 8:30, which didn't jive with our babysitting situation.  So I called HWK, which I've been dying to try since I drove by and spied their sweet space on Manchester.  You people in Maplewood are incredibly lucky to have this restaurant in your midst.  Bow low.\n\nWe were warmly greeted by one of the owners, Josh, and heard about a few revisions to the ever-changing menu.  I like a place that refuses to serve a dish due to sub-par ingredients and yesterday the sardines didn't pass the perfection inspection, so they were nixed from the appetizer menu.  No problem for me as I had my eye on the potted pork appetizer, which was outstanding.  The well-seasoned, unctuous spread contrasted nicely with the crisp grilled bread and paired well with pickled radishes, coarse mustard and red onions.  I had a tiny scoop left when the bread ran out and I had it boxed up so none would go to waste.  No potted pork left behind!\n\nSince it's the perfect time of year for stellar tomatoes and glorious, sugary corn, my husband and I were torn between the sides of creamed corn and heirloom tomatoes.  We asked our server if he thought we might be overdoing it if we ordered both sides in addition to our entrees (since we weren't familiar with HWK's portion sizes) and he suggested we'd do fine with just one side... Buuuuuuut, I said it was BIRTHDAY DINNER and how could we pass up two dishes made up of ingredients so absolutely at their prime?  We couldn't.  We ordered the tomatoes and the corn and the chicken and the wild boar.  Thank goodness.  Thank goodness, not because the portions were tiny (in fact, I'd say they were fairly generous and a really good value), but because the FOOD. WAS. AWESOME.\n\nI couldn't help myself when the little cast iron dish holding the creamed corn made it to the table.  I dove right in to the blessed mix of perfect corn, bacon, green onion and leeks and practically shouted to Justin, \"You have to try this NOW!\"  Part of me wishes I hadn't been so exuberant about it--maybe I wouldn't have had to share so much.  But damn, that was one of the finest side dishes I've ever had the pleasure of eating.  Ever.  I almost wept with joy.\n\nThe heirloom tomatoes, noted as having thyme, honey and balsamic components on the menu, also arrived in a cast iron dish, which surprised us--I think we were expecting a cold, more salad-like dish.  Don't mistake that for disappointment, though, because these tomatoes were also delicious.  Roasted, sweet and juicy, they tasted like the best fresh, chunky tomato soup you can imagine and the bright yellow, orange and red tomatoes just looked cheery.  Does that sound silly?  Probably.  I'm still giddy from this dinner; indulge me here.\n\nJustin had the wild boar shoulder for dinner, flavored with cumin, orange and currants, slow-cooked in wine and served with fragrant basmati rice.  The boar was topped with orange gremolata, if I'm not mistaken--a mixture of garlic, parsley and orange zest--and Justin was just blown away by the flavor combination.  He said it reminded him of a dinner we shared at Rick Bayless' Topolobampo in Chicago, which, if I had to guess, would probably be rated as his #1 dining experience in his 32 years, so this is really high praise for HWK.  It really was delicious.\n\nI had the chicken entree--a perfectly seasoned, crisp skinned, juicy breast and wing accompanied by arugula, bacon and these surprisingly amazing fingerling potatoes.  I was just shocked by how crisp (not burned; crisp) the outsides were and how creamy delicious the insides were.  The arugula gave them a nice nutty taste and the bacon added a nice saltiness to the dish.  I chose wisely.  And I about licked my plate clean.\n\nI was beyond full at this point in the meal and should've passed on dessert, but I was intrigued by the stone fruit dessert with orange cream.  To be fair, I couldn't eat much more of anything at all, but this was the only item of the night I wasn't head over heels in love with.  The fruit was poached, I believe, with some spices, giving it that Christmas-y, mulled wine sort of taste.  I know lots of people who love that, but it's not my favorite.  Maybe I should've tried the goat cheese tart with honey and pistachios, but I thought its richness might totally put me over the edge... Maybe next time. :)\n\nI enjoyed our server, who was knowledgeable, friendly and efficient, and I loved getting to chat with the owners, Josh and Cassie (who is also the chef).  They've done incredible work on the space and made it a unique, intimate place.

We've never had to wait longer than 10 minutes to be seated. They've got a large selection of beer and wine, both domestic and international. It's always fun to try something new when ever we go. Sadly, Terra Sur is too far from where we live but it's a great place to visit when we are in the area. It's always a nice, random surprise!\n\nFor starters, we've tried the Teque\u00f1os y Yuquitas Fritas and Pulpo al Olivo. I always love fried goodies, especially when there is cheese involved (Really though, who doesn't love this?). So, the teque\u00f1os and yuquitas were pretty good, particularly with the dipping sauces. I don't recall their names exactly but they were green and orange-ish, and definitely spicy! I recommend them both. The pulpo (octopus) had a nice texture to it, definitely chewy but not to the point where your jaw gets tired from it. A negative for me was that I thought the appetizer would have had more octopus. I was disappointed to see only 5-6 pieces of pulpo on our plate. On the upside, the black olive puree was delicious and the chimichurri was fantastic.\n\nFor entrees, we've had the Ceviche de Camaron, Chupe and Jalea. I've grown up eating my dad's Ecuadorian ceviche, which is different than Peruvian ceviche. So, I'll admit I was skeptical that this ceviche would be good. I won't say that it surpassed my dad's ceviche because all components of it were completely different than my dad's; however, Terra Sur's ceviche was incredibly good and fresh. A small order of the shrimp ceviche was enough for my dinner and a couple bites for my husband to try. \n\nThe Chupe is a delicious seafood broth made up of potatoes, peas, an egg, rice, corn and lima beans with either shrimp or a mixed combination of shrimp and fish. I've gained confidence in Terra Sur's fresh seafood so I went for the mixed Chupe with shrimp and red snapper. WOW! This was so flavorful and hearty. I could imagine myself eating this soup for breakfast in the mountains of Peru. It was really good. I finished the entire soup myself, to the waiter's surprise and my own! \n\nLastly, the Jalea is what I would say is the Peruvian version of a fried sampler dish. You can find mussels, calamari, fish, shrimp and yuca, all fried to a delicious golden brown. On the side, you get your fresh corn and cancha to add to the mix.

I got half of a turkey sandwich, a side of sesame-chili eggplant salad, freshly homemade potato chips, mint lemonade, and a perfect slice of a Mexican chocolate-coconut brownie to round off this most refreshing meal for under $10 with tax and tip.\n\n2.

The options that they offer may SEEM limited upon first glance, but if you read the descriptions of each sandwich and salad, you soon realize that your options are in fact limitless.  The little refrigerator you see before you boasts such a fantastic variety of styles and flavors and sings to anyone who walks their way.  Vegan?  No problem!\n\n4. I hate going to restaurants where I immediately think: \"I could make this myself, only better.\"  That thought never crossed my mind here!  They play on very simple food items (sandwiches, salads, chips, brownies), and just pump up the volume on them by adding great flavors through savory/sweet spices, and an interesting new play on added ingredients.\n\n5.  As an added bonus, they have an AWESOME touch pad to pay for your food (if you pay by credit card).  They check all of the items you purchased, and hand it over to you to add tip and sign.

Honestly the beer prices weren't bad, I spent too much money, but for a 16oz craft beer from draft it was $11 and for a 25oz domestic canned beer it was also $11. All the bartenders were very knowledgeable about the products and spirits. Scott didn't think that his cocktails were worth it because we like ours strong, though. At $20 for a double is about the average for any sort of concert venue. The whole staff was extremely friendly and helpful in whatever questions we had when getting drinks, walking around or getting back to our seats. \n\nOne of the major pluses to Bridgestone Arena is that they have a section for smokers & people who just want some fresh air to go outside and be able to re-enter at. This was excellent because between The Pretenders and Stevie Nicks there was about a 20 minute intermission that would have just been boring to sit through, so we were able to get a drink each and enjoy a cancer stick outside. \n\nOverall I would LOVE to see another one of my idols at Bridgestone Arena again, and soon because we weren't able to explore Nashville too much due to the next day being election day (gotta do my civic duty!), but I'm all. The. Way. Down.

(I'm sort of Buddhist.) After eating a piece of this gorgeously quartered, super air-y, banh mi-like masterpiece--which rested on this PG-13 wet dream-sauce of rum, brown sugar, and butter, and dusted with white powder--I almost started crying. Like, when Scar clawed Mufasa's paws on that cliff and then savagely watched his brother get trampled to death by a heard in the Lion King-crying.\n\nBut happy crying. Not sad crying. So there's a better analogy here...\n\nEach bite reminded me of the first time I lost my virginity. (TMI?) \"Is this happening? Is this REALLY happening, and am I using protection (napkins)?\" my mind asked. Immediately soon after the self-questioning, my brain answered its questions: \"Yes, Jonathan, their naughty French toast took you to this part of your sub-conscious.\" Oh my goodness. How did I not blackout?  \n\nThen I wanted more with Surrey's. Not a fling, but a full-out relationship, which would include hand-holding and love themed memes. So I ate their Shrimp and Grits ($13.25).\n\n\"JEE-SUUS! Hashtag blessed.\" --Bruno Mars.\n\nThe grits, smooth and creamy as a light-skinned baby's ass, probably ranks as the best I've ever put in my mouth. (It doesn't hurt they garnished it with savory bacon, freshly chopped green onions, and homemade croutons.) Also, the Gulf shrimp didn't taste frozen and oozed juices with each chomp of flesh and had enough Cajun kick.\n\nMy boo ate their Crab Meat Omelette ($12.95) and loved every bite, too. I believe she said she's never had a better omelet. \n\nThey also have fresh vegetable and fruit juices:\n\n-Carrot, apple, orange, grapefruit at $5.25 and $6.50 for a 12oz and 16oz, respectively. \n-Kale, celery, beet, or cucumber additions for .55 cents. \n-Ginger for $1.05. \n\nEverything tasted great, but it's rare I find a healthy juice super memorable.

I knew he was on Top Chef, but to be honest, as much as I love restaurants and food, I just can't do cooking competition shows.  They are always on at like 10 pm and they just make me hungry and craving crazy foods late at night.  \n\nHowever, I heard many good things about Sbraga and they were offering a Chef's Counter menu of \"tailgate\" foods.  So my husband and I ventured up Broad St to check it out.\n\nLet me pause a minute and explain how Sbraga works.  So they offer a 4 course meal for $49 pp.  Each course has about 8-10 options to choose from.  However...\n\nMonday through Thursday, at 6 pm sharp, they offer a Chef's Counter menu, which is a set menu with a specific theme and is served at a bar that overlooks the kitchen.  Think of it as a sort of dinner theater.  FYI- there is a maximum of 6 people allowed for this seating.  This option has six courses, as well as an amuse bouche for $75 pp.  A bit pricier than the regular menu, but you get to watch the chefs prepare your meal for you AND they explain each dish to you.  For you Top Chef fans, Chef Kevin explains some of the courses as well.  Super cool.  I felt like Padma that night (hey, I've SEEN the show, I just don't watch it regularly.  Cause it makes me hungry)\n\nUpon arriving at 6 pm sharp, I noticed how classy and chic the interior is.  At 6:01, I realized how awesome their service is.  I was ready to give Sbraga 4 stars, but their service puts them over the edge.  They make their guests feel right at home.\n\nSo how was the food?  Here are the courses and my opinion of each:\n\nAmuse:  Meatballs--- I make some pretty good meatballs, but these blow mine away.  I really liked the sauce- sweet and savory at the same time.\n\nFIRST:  Hoagie Dip--- Hoagie Dip usually makes me a little quesy, but Sbraga's was a delightful fluff of deliciousness.  I could have eaten that all night.\n\nSECOND:  Pepperoni and Beer Cheese Soup--- My favorite thing that we had that night.  A soup made of three things I love?  Yes please!!\n\nTHIRD:  Sloppy Jose--- Chef Kevin brings a latin flava to his sloppy joe by using shortrib and chorizo, and covering it in a spicy cole slaw.  Ole!\n\nFOURTH:  Pork Gyro---  I love Greek food and this dish has a homemade tzatziki sauce that was awesome\n\nFIFTH:  Buffalo Chicken--- Surprisingly, my least favorite meal.  The chicken was a little undercooked and the celery-apple-carrot salad missed the mark for me.\n\nSIXTH:  Brownie Sundae--- I thought I couldn't fit anymore food in my stomach.. until this dish came out.  Brownie, covered with ice cream, bananas, strawberries. YUM!\n\nAlso, the bartender, who was an absolute doll, brought us over complimentary spiked hot chocolate with a dollop of white chocolate liquor whipped cream.  He mentioned that he made the cocoa in case someone did the beverage pairing, but since no one did, he just gave it to us (sans a bit of the liquor.. which was fine by me on a Tuesday night).  How's that for service?  They could have just thrown it in the trash! \n\nOverall, I loved the experience of watching the chefs work (worth the extra money) and while I wasn't blown away by the food, their service and ambiance convinved me to come back and try their regular menu sometime soon.", "date": "2012-12-05 15:12:33"}, {"_key": "1804884", "_id": "reviews/1804884", "_rev": "_fNyy1o6--Z", "review_id": "wCHsDuIlW_n8r2yy5NFqLQ", "user_id": "Dr_8XKry-YFPX5gKwflS7w", "business_id": "oQ5CPRt0R3AzFvcjNOqB1w", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Literally the best meal I have ever eaten.

I tried the banana and fell in love with it. It's not an overly sweet cupcake but more of a rich flavor from the banana. Well, that was a few weeks ago and tonight we stopped by the location after dinner at Taqueria Del Sol. 12 South is really and up and coming place, isn't it? \n\nThe store is located next to Dapper James (aka Reese Witherspoon's fancy store). The Sprinkles cupcake shop has the infamous cupcake ATM. Whoever came up with this creation is marketing genius. I remember when they came out with the first one in Beverly Hills and it was on all the news sites. Now Nashville is lucky enough to have one. And the people of Nashville must love using it, because I've seen tons of Instagram/Facebook/Twitter pictures of people using it. Funny enough, when we stopped by around 8pm on a Wednesday night, there was a line of people using the ATM, taking pictures, taking selfies. At one point, the line was LONGER to use the cupcake ATM than to order from the counter inside. At it was 37 degrees outside! \n\nAnyway, the inside of the store is pretty small. I think this part used to be an alleyway and they made it into the Sprinkles store. I was boring and ordered the banana cupcake again. I skimmed the counters and was only seeing chocolate stuff and this might sound crazy, but I'm not a huge fan of chocolate. Of course, after we ordered I saw the strawberry and the vanilla. I will have to try those next time. My friend (who is gluten free) was with us and got the gluten free red velvet cupcake and said it was very good for gluten free, nice and moist. Phillip got the captain crunch ice cream in a waffle cone. The cone was nearly falling apart and the girl making it behind the counter asked him if he wanted a different one, but it took it anyway. It take a little time for them to pack up the cupcakes. The presentation is worthy of the $3.75 price tag. I wished the bag had a couple napkins in it, however. \n\nThis is a great addition to the neighborhood and Nashville. I think they'll have no problems bring in business from all the foot traffic along 12 South. I also think they aren't in competition with the other cupcake places, such as Gigi's because this isn't so focused on a huge blob of icing on top. The flavors here are more simple and clean, in my opinion. I might even try out that ATM (maybe with a selfie too!).\n\n(PS- the cupcakes are more of a value compared to the ice cream. One scoop for $3.75 is pretty funny in my opinion.)", "date": "2016-01-07 22:32:51"}, {"_key": "1805011", "_id": "reviews/1805011", "_rev": "_fNyy1pS--P", "review_id": "TDo56_yM8z-zPARhsU-9fg", "user_id": "5aAfropij4PFIw1K6Tf6Dw", "business_id": "QpPc51mH86xyrRmnFijpTQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 4, "funny": 3, "cool": 3, "text": "I found this little gem while passing through TN to see family during a move. \nLOVED IT!! \n\n1.

You can order whole pies or by-the-slice, making it a great choice for an anytime meal. \n\nFood: I have yet to try something on Lulu's menu that I don't like. While my husband normally gets 2 slices, I almost always gravitate toward the salads, which are huge and super flavorful. The cheese & basil is the best slice of pizza I've had, but my husband claims the jalape\u00f1o popper pizza is out of this world. It's hard to go wrong, no matter what slice you choose. The scapegoat salad is my favorite and comes out in a very big portion. The breadsticks are also really unique and a big serving. They don't skimp! We have never tried their sushi. \n\nDrinks: Self-serve soda and they always have a lemon/cucumber water. I like that they serve lots of local beers and hard ciders as well. \n\nAtmosphere: It's almost always lively during lunch time but it's never hard to find a seat. They have TV's for sports and cute decor up on the walls. I like their big patio and that its dog-friendly. \n\nService: Man, the folks behind the counter are always smiling and happy. They serve up your food crazy-fast, too! That's the benefit of by-the-slice ordering. \n\nHappy Hour Offerings: Daily lunch specials--2 slices and a drink or 1 slice and a side salad. \n\nHealthy Hack: I love Lulu's because when my husband wants pizza (which is often), I can get a totally filling, healthy salad... And they have so many to choose from.

To which, my server responded, \"Sure...we have a house roast, dark roast, or a vanilla flavored?\"\n\nAre you kidding me?  A breakfast place with coffee OPTIONS?  And, one of those options is DARK roast?  Color me caffeinated.  I promptly ordered their dark roast which came poured out of a carafe left at the table.  Plus, they have flavored creamer (bonus!).  This was definitely not your usual (awful) diner coffee.  It was dark and delicious.\n\nFortunately, my dining companions were familiar with the menu and HIGHLY recommended the Salmon Eggs Benedict.  Always a fan of anything including hollandaise sauce--I went for it.  My people!  Perfection.  Here's the thing, when you smother something in hollandaise, you can easily be lazy in the preparation of what comes UNDERNEATH the hollandaise.  I mean, it's going to be smothered in all that lovely, buttery deliciousness--who will notice?  I will notice, people.  I will.  And, there was definitely nothing lackadaisical about the preparation of this dish.  The salmon, even without the hollandaise, was moist and flavorful.  The eggs were perfectly, beautifully, delicately poached.  It was the single best Salmon Benedict I've ever consumed (possibly the best Eggs Benedict in general!).  \n\nThe Benedict came with a side of home fried potatoes, which had a light peppery flavor that I quite enjoyed.  The service was spot on--prompt, attentive, and friendly.\n\nOne final note I have is the menu:  The menu is expansive.  If you have family and/or friends in town with diverse tastes--this is a wonderful option for breakfast.  They have all your classic selections covered (bacon & eggs, chicken fried steak, various scrambles).  They have the sweet (pancakes, stuffed french toast, waffles, crepes).  And, they've got your savory (An entire list of various Benedicts, skillets, and classic to creative omelets).  I can't imagine anyone NOT finding something they'd enjoy.\n\nPlus, I was informed they have an entire gluten free menu.

I had been missing that option for a while, as I'm very used to getting pizza by the slices back home, since I can't eat a whole pizza on my own, and I'm usually running off to do something.  Although it can be a wait sometimes, when you are ordering a whole pie, the pizza here is one of my favorites in the city.  It's also nice that I have a place to go for a super late night eat.\n\nBut aside from the pizza, since there are many reviews on the pizza.  I want to focus on the other dishes that are available now.  From thursday to sunday, New York Pizza offers an alternative menu for lunch and dinner.  The alternative menu features traditional Italian entrees (e.g., parmesan, marsala, pepperonata, piccante) your option of chicken or veal that comes with a salad, fresh made al dente pasta, and 2 slices of garlic and italian herb bread. The portion is large, usually 3 pounded pieces of chicken/veal, and you can easily share the dish with another person.  I highly recommend the parmesan and the marsala dishes, however, I did not like the piccante (capers are not really my thing), and I have yet to try the pepperonata.\n\nI cannot neglect some of the appetizers, you can order an AWESOME French onion soup, and yummy eggplant parmesan.\n\nI would like to say that I often think of the French onion soup at New York Pizza now, and it is the biggest draw for me to go there between thursday and sunday.  The onions, you can tell, have been slow cooked on a low heat and caramelized to perfection, and the broth (vegetable) is so flavorful.  The bread is tender in the savoury tasting broth, and there is a generous, but perfect amount of melted cheese on top.  When I was eating it, I was just having fun scooping up the soup, bread, onions, and twirling the hot melted cheese around my spoon.  Writing this is making me want to go get some right now.\n\nThe breading on the eggplant parmesan and the entree parmesan are the same, and I definitely love it.  Usually, I don't eat eggplant, but in this form, it was very good.  It was fresh, the breading was fresh and crisp, again with a mix of italian herbs, and it was not overly greasy, like you would find in other places.\n\nWhat is this that I've also heard recently and got to try?  The chef added chicken fingers for children that also comes with a salad, the breading is the same that is used for the parmesan, and let me say, it was fresh and delicious.  You could switch out some slices of chicken fingers for mozzarella sticks, whatever your kids, or maybe yourself would like.\n\nI think I'll hit up New York Pizza again some time this weekend.

Bad news for the little shops over on the other side, though.

Great location, right down the street from Rosalita's. I arrived early and got a table for the four of us. Our waitress was awesome, very welcoming and knowledgeable. I started off with the red pepper and gouda soup- just as wonderful as it sounds. Plenty of substance, not overly cheesy - very filling for a soup. Everyone else got one of the signature martini's. Everyone loved them, except two people with the same martini complained their drinks were dissimilar, and the waitress and bartender quickly corrected it, no problem. They have small plates there, which aren't my thing, but the one person in my party who got one liked it.  There was a fish special that looked and apparently tasted delicious.

Not only do you get to eat authentic Moroccan cuisine, you get to enjoy a cultural experience as well. \n\nYou may have walked past Marrakesh or the surrounding streets many times without even realizing it was there, like I had prior to this visit. It's nestled on Leithgow Street just a notch off of South Street. Forget South Street or even the rest of Philadelphia for that matter. You are about to step into a different world. To enter you must ring the doorbell on the side door. \n\nI felt more like I was going to a house, than a restaurant; especially with the shower located in the restroom on the second floor. During my entire visit, I never felt like I was at a restaurant. I felt comfortable and relaxed. Maybe eating with your hands with a towel on your lap has that effect. \n\nI found my group of fellow Yelpers in a cozy private room.  The room had four tables with booth seating along the outskirts of the room. Ottoman like chairs took up the rest of the space for the rest of us. With such a large group in not the largest of spaces, it got loud.\n\nOur meal started with customary hand-washing and we were even entertained twice with a belly dancer. After placing our order, the food kept flowing. The service was probably the most unobtrusive service I've ever had. As one dish was placed in front of us, another was seamlessly removed. I felt like royalty or at least someone enjoying a nice meal at someone's dinner party. The regular dining formalities I'm used to were thrown out the window, and it was fantastic! \n\nAs I'm sure you're aware, this $25 prix fixe menu has seven courses and you are welcome to BYOB. While it was a ton of food, I walked in the door absolutely starving and walked out not overly stuffed. I believe most people left absolutely full, so maybe the tip is to come in extremely hungry. Here's a little rundown of dining experience:\n\nCourse 1: Three-Salad Platter- The eggplant is phenomenal (and messy). Luckily you have some assistance from the pita to eat it. The cucumbers and bell peppers and carrots and cucumber were good, but the eggplant stole the show. \n\nCourse 2: The B'stella- As someone who doesn't normally love sweets but loves cinnamon, carbs and meat, this dish was a winner. This dish was dough filled with chicken, nuts, almonds, egg, peppers and onions. It was really hot at first, but once you cracked open the shell and let it cool down, it was easier to eat. I had some pita saved from the first course, so I found it easy to break off a piece and rest it on the pita while it cooled down. Truly a sweet-savory delight. \n\nCourse 3: Chicken- So here's where the choices began. You can either get chicken with lemon or spicy chicken. My group opted to get the spicy chicken with the cumin sauce on the side. The chicken was melt in your hands and then melt in your mouth good. The spicy sauce had a nice kick without being overly spicy to me. I still had some pita leftover so I did a little dipping with the sauce. \n\nCourse 4: Beef or Lamb- My table got a little creative here and asked for half portions of both the beef and lamb. The beef was served shish kebab style, and to be honest, not my favorite. It was a little well done, and I struggled a little to get it off the stick resulting in a pepper flying into my husband's wine glass. Sauvignon blanc tastes best with a little pepper anyways, right? The lamb was perfect. Even the non-lamb eaters thought it was delicious. It was tender and took on the flavor of the chick peas and onions without having an overwhelming lamb flavor. \n\nCourse 5: Couscous with veggies, chick peas and raisins- This was probably my least favorite dish from the main meal. It was a little blander than other couscous dishes I've tried in the past. I would have been disappointed if this was the only thing I ordered, but everything was a hit thus far in the evening. They did give us spoons at this point, so don't worry about eating the little grains with your hands.\n\nCourses 6 & 7: Dessert- I'm assuming the tea, fruit and pastries count as the sixth and seventh courses. At this point in the evening, my bottle of wine had been consumed and I wasn't counting the dishes, and am making this assumption while referencing the menu. I'm not a tea fan so I passed. The pastries were little crisp triangles that reminded me of baklava. The fruit came out frozen was a little hard to eat. I nibbled on a strawberry and took a banana for the road since the majority of the group passed on the fruit. Perhaps the fruit was customary, but I thought a little unnecessary. If it's part of the traditional meal then no harm, no foul.  \n\nTo sum it up, I had delicious food and hours of fun. It's an experience not to be missed in Philadelphia, especially if you go with an adventurous group of friends. While I couldn't imagine going to Marrakesh every Friday night, I can definitely pick a handful of occasions that would be a perfect fit.", "date": "2015-07-28 15:31:21"}, {"_key": "1807391", "_id": "reviews/1807391", "_rev": "_fNyy1xi--N", "review_id": "60srjXMqGX-2nw0v32aDzg", "user_id": "9seGOufCVY4x2DNxu6UZhg", "business_id": "Yh4OgbXQSpQ_ycK_FmNiGw", "stars": 4, "useful": 8, "funny": 4, "cool": 5, "text": "My darling & I stumbled upon this intriguing new spot last night on our way to dinner in the bywater.

I ordered a \"frozen\" margarita. It was the only frozen margarita on the menu and was pomegranate. It was okay, but a little off for my tastes. It was also melted and no longer frozen within a few minutes of it arriving. I only finished about half of it. We ordered during happy hour when the margarita is supposed to be $5 instead of the usual $9. We had to ask for the happy hour price, but more on that in a moment. \n\nThree of us decided to split a queso fundito. This is one of my favorite Mexican Appetizers and I order it regularly at traditional Mexican restaurants. While the queso fundito was still good at Besito, it was disappointing to someone that has had a traditional version. It is supposed to be essentially a fondue type pot of melted cheese with some chorizo and served with tortillas. Besito cheapened theirs by adding piles of onions and peppers. It was also served in a very shallow square skillet. When split three ways (and with the 2-3 others in the room that tried it), it left very little queso fundito. The flavor was good. However, with the added thick peppers and onions and the small quantity, I would not order again. \n\nI was able to try the chips, salsa and table side guacamole also. I will say that this is probably the best guacamole that I have ever tried. I loved the flavor and the thick chunks of avocado. The salsa and guac were my favorite things at Besito. However, I can't see myself paying $10 for guac on a return visit. That is just way too much for guacamole in my opinion. \n\nFor my meal, I ordered the Chile Rellenos Con Hongos. I order Rellenos anytime I see them on the menu since they are one of my favorite things. Most restaurants serve them with some rice and beans or some sort of side. Let's face it...stuffed relleno peppers are not the most filling thing in the world. My Rellenos did not come with a side. The came with sauce and nothing else for a whopping $18. I almost didn't order them when I saw the price, but everything else on the menu was that price or higher. The Rellenos had good flavor for the first bite...or maybe two. However, a few bites in I was over it. They are stuffed in goat cheese and there are globs of goat cheese on the outside. So much freaking goat cheese. I like the stuff, but it was overboard. That wasn't the worst part though, it was the pine nuts. There seemed to be a whole bag of the things mixed into my small plate. I would never order this again. \n\nOur service was great until it came time for the checks. Our waitress did not give us happy hour prices for the margaritas we ordered before happy hour was up. She also messed up dividing our appetizer between the three checks. However, the worst was that we handed the checks to them with our cards in each individual envelope. When they returned, my card was with my friends check (and had been charged) and my check was missing. WTH? It ended up taking us about 45 minutes to get our checks, get them corrected, get them corrected again and get out of there. My poor husband had dropped me off and was waiting outside this whole time since I thought I was almost done when I received the check. Uggg. \n\nI don't think I will be back to Besito anytime soon. If I do, it will be for happy hour only.

We all shared the Asturian Blue cheese which was nicely complimented by a blackberry sauce, I had the wild mushroom sandwich which had a lovely lemony flavor, my boyfriend had the three cheese sandwich (which I have ordered before and is quite good), and our friend had the truffled egg toast, which we have also tried before and is one of the standout starter items.\n\nAll in all, I have yet to be disappointed by an experience at a Tria in either location, even with these crazy extenuating circumstances!", "date": "2010-03-13 21:40:46"}, {"_key": "1808575", "_id": "reviews/1808575", "_rev": "_fNyy12W--D", "review_id": "1xh8Mn-cYJrJD2lSLvCEdQ", "user_id": "RdLTUqd662yMT1IcCG5sQw", "business_id": "Hl1snIVcDuihCT1raOwe3A", "stars": 4, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I love the Chicken Salads at this place.

My first visit to Fed Nuts was last year.  I was talking to one of the owners outside who is a friend of mine.  I was hungry and chicken sounded perfect.  I walked in and ordered a spicy chicken from the super awesome Blake F.... this is how it went down\n\nI pushed open the screen door and my senses were overloaded in fried goodness. My life seemed rather dull and lusterless before inhaling the medley of donuts and chicken.  A familiar face was at the counter and beaming her winning smile.  \n\n\"Hey buddy, good to see you!\" I said.\n\"Hey there, welcome!\" she replied.\nI could barely contain my hunger at this point. If I wouldn't look insane for licking the sweet air, I would have.\n\"Can I get the spicy chicken?\" I said.  God knows I love everything spicy and fortunately, luck was on my side.\n\"You bet, 1 spicy\" she commanded.\n\nI paid and waited for my chicken.  As I was admiring the simple establishment that has nailed the adage, \"Do a few things VERY well instead of a lot of things crappily,\" an old timer walked up and adjusted his worn cover.  He ordered chicken but his fortune was not as mine.\n\n\"Sorry, we just ran out, he got the last one.\"  \nThe seasoned Philadelphian turned to me with a mired glare that said \"you gotta be shittin me.\"  I really wondered if he would wait idly in on a wooden stool and leap for the box of chicken as it offered to me, only to run out the door with a super villain cackle.  Didn't happen though, he left with a donut and I ate the chicken.\n\n2. I ran an experiment where I brought them in to work and let a bunch of people try them.  Invariably, every person would take a bite and say, \"This is like the best donut I've ever had.\"", "date": "2013-02-28 13:00:56"}, {"_key": "1808626", "_id": "reviews/1808626", "_rev": "_fNyy12e--O", "review_id": "LlvCXMS0Am_zSzDBkmYYyQ", "user_id": "Wa-DgCDkaB3O0xP3cJimFQ", "business_id": "-0Ym1Wg3bXd_TDz8JtvOQg", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I'm a little late to the party and have been meaning to stop by Yelo'd since it opened, but didn't have the chance until this past weekend! It certainly did not disappoint. I stopped in after work and it was a little bit of a rainy day, so there wasn't a line. \n\nI tried the Halo Halo and had the Ube / Keso flavour swirl, but you can also just choose a single flavour. Ube is one of my favourite flavours, so I never pass up on that when given the chance. The flavour wasn't overly subtle and just perfect, and the leche flan that was also included as part of the toppings was a really nice addition!\n\nWhile I was there, I also stopped into pick up 4 pints as part of the crowd funding I had supported months prior. One of the owners came out to help us select the 4 pints. He gave us samples of each of the flavours on tap to help us make our decision when we told him this was our first time in Yelo'd! He was super friendly and genuinely cared about providing a great experience and one of the reasons why I love supporting local businesses! \n\nThere are usually 4 flavours on tap and are rotated every so often. If you're looking to purchase a pint; However, they may have additional flavours tucked away in their fridge, so definitely worth asking about if you're looking for a flavour they previously had that may no longer be on tap! We ended up picking up Buko, Ube, Pandan, & Keso. Super excited to try out these flavours at home :)\n\nThe shop is super colorful, cute, and really cozy. There are a few benches outside for you to enjoy your soft serve ice cream! And the menu is displayed on the wall, which is great, so you can easily ponder your options while waiting in line and don't have to play the squinting game.\n\nThey also had some cookies, pies, pandesal buns, and a few other items, which I will have to go back and try at a later date. I really liked how everything in the shop, the soft serve and baked treats had filipino/asian flavours. Definitely, something a bit different and unique!

I took advantage the one night that the Homewood didn't have free dinner, and I'm glad I did.\n\nIt took me a while to decide what to order, because several of the menu items looked amazing. I eventually decided on a salad and a half pizza. Yes, they sell half pizzas, which is the best idea ever. More pizza places should do this. Mostly so I don't order a whole one and ending up eating the entire thing. But that's beside the point.\n\nI had the house salad, described on the menu as iced greens, roasted peppers, pine nuts, red onion, smoked bacon and sweet pepper vinaigrette. The iced greens were very heavy on the dandelion greens, which I can't stand. So that made me a little sad. But everything else about the salad was excellent. The pepper vinaigrette was perfect - similar to a catalina or french dressing but a little thicker and a little sweeter. The pine nuts just added a little something different. I would have loved to have had more greens - if I get the chance to order it again, I may ask for it on spinach instead.\n\nThe half pizza was probably about a 10 or 12 inch pizza - not big slices, but not tiny. The crust was crisp, and the sauce was very tasty. All in all, a mighty tasty pizza, but nothing super special or different about it. It was pretty much what I was hoping for.\n\nApparently the entire menu is that good - I got back one night and there were a few cops hanging out that apparently come into the Homewood and order dinner from Coast on a regular basis. Definitely better food than I've experienced in the past in hotels of a Hilton Garden Inn type - more along the lines of what I would have expected at a regular Hilton.

The Banana Foster's French Toast is unbelievable. I loved everything about it. The toast is very soft and sweet. The banana cream inside and the Banana Foster sauce on top are incredible. They are sure to satisfy any sweet tooth. I devoured the entire dish quickly. I rank the dish as one of four French Toast dishes that are above all others. I do not even want to rank them 1, 2, 3, 4. Instead, I will rank them 1, 1a, 1b, 1c:\n\nTop 4 French Toasts:\n\n1. Blue Moon Caf\u00e9 in Baltimore (1621 Aliceanna St, Baltimore, MD 21231): The Cap'N Crunch French Toast tops my list. Grinding cereal and using it to create a crunchy crust is genius. I also enjoy the fresh fruit on top.\n\n2. Blu Jam Caf\u00e9 (7371 Melrose Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90046): The Crunchy French Toast features a cornflake crust. It also has berries on top. I slightly like the Cap'N Crunch French Toast better because I enjoy the Cap'N Crunch crust a little more.\n\n3. Surrey Caf\u00e9 and Juice Bar: The Banana Foster's French Toast is on par with both. I give the other two the thinnest of margins because I love the cereal crust. Nevertheless, the banana cream and Banana Foster sauce is an equalizer.\n\nI also ordered a side of home fries. The potatoes had excellent seasoning and a nice crunchy skin. In addition, Surrey is a juice bar. I had a fresh squeezed orange juice. Is a large, 16 ounce juice really worth $6.50? Personally, I would not normally pay for it. However, I wanted to try a fresh juice since I saw great reviews for them. It was very good. Nevertheless, it is a lot more than I would want to pay for juice. I got to Surrey at 8 AM when it opens. The place is great so the seating will fill up quickly. On a Sunday, it was almost full by the time I left at 9 AM.\n\n4. Stanley Restaurant :Surrey's Caf\u00e9 and Juice Bar have a slight edge with the toast and Fosters sauce. However, Stanley's additional toppings (bananas, banana chips, and vanilla ice cream) and beautiful presentation is an equalizer.\n\nIf you are visiting New Orleans and looking for recommendations, please see If you are visiting New Orleans and looking for recommendations, feel free to message me through Yelp and I can share my itinerary, which includes my Yelp reviews.

They offer a decent selection of entrees as part of a lunch special, which prices options between $8.50 - $10.  I was told the lunch special portion size is smaller than you'd get if you purchased a regular entree, but there was more than enough food for me.  I'm still very full 2 hours later. \n\nI had lunch alone today, so I sat at the bar and they offered complementary water and tea. I also took a look at their draft menu, which had a nice selection of craft brews.  They also offer a decent amount of bottled beer, cocktails, wine, etc. They definitely don't skimp in the bar offerings.\n\nFor lunch I had the Garlic Sauce Chicken, which came with rice on the side.  It came out really quickly, definitely less than 10 minutes after ordering.  This surprised me, and not necessarily in a good way, I immediately questioned how good it could be if it was cooked and brought out so quickly. However, my fears immediately went away with the first bite. The food was hot and delicious. I don't think Han Dynasty is trying to offer truly authentic Chinese food, this seemed like an American Chinese dish. That didn't matter though, the food was great and 100% better than any of the surrounding University City Chinese food restaurants and trucks that I've eaten at.

The only other people besides the stylist was her baby girl and significant other. \n\nI've never gotten my hair dyed or nails done here so I can't much insight on that. I always leave smiling about my new haircut. It's a bit of a drive from where I live but it's worth it to me. The past few times I've gone the pricing was pretty fair.

I've spend many an idyllic afternoon/evening here. I've also booked several of my colleagues at the Mazarin when they've come to New Orleans and heard good things from them (as recently as January 2015).\n\nSo when looking to book a hotel for a work conference 10 people I was leading, Hotel Mazarin was at the top of my list. And when you realize that in other local hotels you're probably going to get that New Orleans jenk known as \"charm\"  for a similar price, I will absolutely recommend Hotel Mazarin for being immaculate (with one tiny exception in my bathroom, but I'm insane), amenities (almost Westin-quality beds, flatscreen TVs), and the restrained modern baroque decor (gold fixtures, marble floors). If you're a breakfast-lover, you cannot beat that deluxe complimentary breakfast (eggs & bacon, pastry, toast, cereal, juices). Seriously, I've stayed in New Orleans hotels with TVs straight out of the 90s, ancient (as in, not antique) beds, dated decor and questionable levels of cleanliness. I won't name names (search my reviews if you must). But Hotel Mazarin boasts higher standards. \n\nThat said, my colleagues and I had some issues during our stay last month that should be noted. \n\n-multiple reports of the front desk/reception staff being aloof and often downright surly (unacceptable and so not typical of the superb hospitality that is the custom of New Orleans. I'm honestly scratching my head over this one). One of my people was reprimanded for putting a room card/key in her wallet when she came down to report that her keys weren't working (she never put it in her wallet but even if she had?!) When she explained that she had done no such thing, the response from the desk was an eye roll. Another colleague called the desk to report that his room was noisy. With a week of late nights and early mornings ahead of him, he thought he could request a quieter room. He was informed that he was in a quiet room. That's it. No apologies or explanations. I can write more, but in the interest of space, I leave it at these two instances. \n\nHowever, all of the other hotel staff were great, from management to catering (special props to the lovely Mary who took care of our conference room. She is a gem!) Everyone in the breakfast room and in catering were ALL so lovely and friendly (everyone says good morning and the catering manager walked around talking to everyone, making sure they were having a great stay). \n\n-the showers are extremely tricky to work and some of us didn't have anything hotter than lukewarm water. This is horrible to deal with first thing in the morning on one of the coldest weeks in New Orleans. I live here and I know the city's water pressure leaves a lot to be desired, especially in old French Quarter buildings, but this isn't OK in a hotel. Apparently there was some trick to get it to work and I can't even tell you what that is, because it's really *that* tricky. There should be instructions posted, unless this was a fluke with half of my colleagues' rooms. \n\n-catering: although the food is good, it's extremely overpriced for what you get. You are not allowed to bring in outside food, so if you're using their conference room you're going to have to use these services. I know this is common practice in hotel conference rooms, so although I won't fault them for this, next year I'll try and find an alternative.\n\nRelated to this: when setting up my catering order, I specified that three of my group had dietary restrictions/extreme food allergies. For the very expensive muffaletta sandwiches, I thought they'd at least offer a GF bread option for one or two of them for my G/F colleague, but no. Second, I was told the king cake would be nut free and it was not. Suddenly I saw one of my colleagues leaving the room in the middle of a session and I later learned that he had to go up to his room and take an emergency Benadryl. If he hadn't, he likely would have needed to go to the hospital, for his nut allergy is that extreme. If I put on my request that at least one dessert should be nut free and the only other dessert item is pralines, the cooks should pay attention and not put nuts on the king cake. Pretty simple. Attention to detail is crucial. Again, when you're paying extremely high prices for catering, high expectations should be met.\n\nI would still recommend Hotel Mazarin thanks to its amazing location for visitors to our city, as well as the nice perks, including two comped drinks at the fabulous 21st Amendment Bar. Plus it's just nicer all around than other FQ hotels in this price range.", "date": "2015-04-03 17:12:46"}, {"_key": "1809227", "_id": "reviews/1809227", "_rev": "_fNyy14e--A", "review_id": "OrltS0gRbmoCB-te5AgLaA", "user_id": "7jRqME7-krCDvdkR-dadgA", "business_id": "Tq5jFk_BMSJG8-flqj5Bgw", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "text": "OK St. Louis - let's face it.

They did not serve any type of pico de gallo or salsa with it, nor was there any shredded cheese, a taco staple. Just bunch of lettuce, sparse tomatoes and dry, unseasoned rubbery fish.I asked for some salsa and lime and the server brought back one tiny little plastic cup of pico de gallo, and some dried up limes.. \n\nI like to smother my tacos with salsa.

So after a year of dying to come here, I finally made it.  My girlfriend treated me for my birthday.  We made reservations for 2 at 6PM on a Wednesday night.  This place is BYOB so bring your wine!  The place is SUPER tiny, so be prepared for that.  This isn't your standard Italian place by any stretch.  There are only roughly 12 tables here, which I'm sure undoubtedly ensures the highest quality food coming out in a timely manner.  The wait staff were pretty darn good.  They worked more as a team as the 3 person squad were all constantly at our table either delivering food or checking up on how we were doing.  We never had to ask for more water and were helpful and choosing a perfect menu for us.\n\nWe decided to go with 2 orders of the antipasto and an order of the shrimp/beans appetizer.  The antipasto was AMAZING, almost everything on it was unique and flavorful.  My girlfriend was obsessed with the fresh arugula.  I loved the roasted red peppers, frittada and asparagus.  The shrimp were expertly cooked and seasoned and pretty much unlike any shrimp you get at a restaurant.  Well worth it in my opinion.\n\nFor our entree we decided to get 3 small portions of different pastas on the menu.  We went with the spinach gnocchi, tagliatelli al limone with the bottarga cheese and the pesto trapanese.  All were extremely unique.  I've never had spinach gnocchi quite like this and was such an awesome experience.  The tagliatelli was super fresh and the limone sauce was divine.  I loved the pesto dish and the crushed pistachio on top complimented the pesto so well.\n\nThey are also pretty liberal with their bread here, so order away!  The tomato pie focaccia was amazing.  The other bread was on par as well.\n\nWe ended our night with some zeppolies.  They were warm and fresh.  The nutella sauce was a great modern twist.  A perfect ending to a perfect meal.\n\nThe place can be a bit on the high side, but I think it's totally worth it.  This is coming from someone who would merely be happy with 2 for $20 at Chilis.\n\nOn an ending note, with the place being so super cramped it can get a wee bit loud.  The table next to us had about 6 people and were dominating the noise space of the entire dining area.  It was quite obnoxious, but it was tolerable...only because of the food!\n\nAm I going back?

The last time I was here was for the Elite dinner and I gave it a 5 star review. Today I was not as satisfied with the service or the food. \n\nI arrived around 2pm to meet a friend for some lunch. I believe the hostess saw us, but we actually had to ask her for a table. We were not greeted at all. We did have the option to sit on the patio and so we decided to do that; we both love patios! The hostess brought us to a table, placed the menus down, told us about brunch (which runs until 3pm on Sundays), and walked away. I didn't get the sense that she wanted to be there. A few minutes passed by and no one came to our table...then a few more minutes passed and finally a guy showed up to take our drink order; he was not going to be our server though. Our drinks came out and our server showed up. He was friendly once he arrived so things got better. \n\nWe placed our orders ordered some beer and waited for our food. The food arrived in a good amount of time. I was a little disappointed in my meal and I know my friend was as well. I'll start with my order; goat cheese and strawberry salad with grilled chicken. The salad looked like it was drenched in salad dressing. I completely forgot to ask for my dressing on the side and didn't want to send it back. I like dressing so it was ok, but not everyone is like me and that amount of dressing may have been discouraged another customer. The chicken was really tough and dry! For a grilled chicken I was expecting it to me juicy and flavorful; it wasn't. I was disappointed in the overall salad. My friend ordered the steak salad; medium well. When the salad was brought out she too complained about the amount of dressing; maybe we both should have ordered the dressing on the side? Oh, and her steak she said was tough and more like well done. The kitchen missed the ball on this one. I don't think we will recommend the salads in the future. For the prices of the salads I know we were both expecting something better! Each salad was about $15!

We had gotten there early to camp out a spot to get a better seat because the general admission at the GSR is really bad.  So this meant that during our dinner hour we were going to be stuck in line.  Luckily a very nice couple held our spot while we stopped into Johnny Rockets.\n\nWe asked to sit at the bar to make it quicker.  We ordered up two chili dogs for my daughter, a classic burger for my wife and I ordered up the Houston. I upgraded to sweet potato fries for a buck extra.  The burgers coming out looked really good, mine wasn't as good looking and was just fine tasting.  Nothing to write home about or get excited about, just a standard fare sort of burger.\n\nMy daughter however loved the chili dogs and ate them all up and her fries.  She enjoyed the paper hat that came with the kids meal menu.   Our waitress Daniel was really busy but also really helpful and friendly.\n\nSo if you are staying at the hotel for either a convention or just gambling, this place is a good place to eat for a reasonable price.  The prices are right in line with any other sit down burger joint, maybe even a little lower.\n\nParking isn't really that close because it's inside the mall downstairs at the GSR, but it is 1000000 times better than it's old location on the casino floor getting covered in smoke all day long.  \n\nWondering how busy they will be when summer comes and \"The Beach\" is open.

A beet salad starter which Brit and I shared. Goat cheese and spinach and beets and yup, you guessed it. So so good, as beet salads can be when they're done right. Then?\n\n2. A chanterelle mushroom & fresh vegetable pot pie. Oh my god, I can't even. I love chanterelles, I love pot pies (secret favorite thing), so... you get the idea. Clearly handmade with fresh ingredients, I couldn't stop eating it. It was effing delicious. I was full, and yet, I kept eating. So so good.\n\nThe rest of the bites on the menu were on that whole gastro tip with an emphasis on the more foodie-focused. (God, I still hate the word foodie. I really do.) What I mean? I don't remember seeing offal or brains, but along those lines for sure. Marrow, elk, etc.\n\nAnyways, moving on (and this is important).

I was already heading to TN to visit some family so my mom & I decided to use the Groupon the night before I left so we'd be close to the airport.  We had both been to the hotel in the past (prior to the flood) and thought it was so gorgeous & we couldn't wait to actually stay here & see what the room would look like.  According to their website we were in for a real treat in our room but when we arrived that wasn't the case at all.  \n\nFirst off, their parking has gone up & is now $18 per night to park in a lot that doesn't shuttle you & your luggage to the main hotel, you have to walk.  If you choose to valet the cost is $24 per night which I have a huge issue with...the parking is outside in their own lot, this is not a major city like NYC where parking is limited so I feel that charging people to park & walk is a bit ridiculous, I can see charging $5/10 for valet but charging me to park my own car & shlep my own bags is a slap in the face especially considering the room rates.  How are locals supposed to be patrons to the businesses inside if they have to pay that much just to park?  \n\nThe hotel itself if gorgeous but the room was pretty boring...it was a large single room with a 4 person dining table & 2 armchairs, it was not at all what was explained on their website which indicated \"Our suites include a moderate-size living room and optional connecting bedrooms with endless possibilities for entertaining or for small corporate meetings\".  This led me to believe that we wouldn't be sleeping in the moderate sized living room & have no bedroom at all.  At no time during booking or check in was I asked how many beds I wanted & since I thought our suite had bedroom(s) I didn't ask & when we got to the room we had 1 king.  I called down to the front desk first to ask why we were put in a standard room & why it only had 1 bed & I was told \"our Jr. suite is just 1 large room & you should have specified when asked how many beds you wanted\" I replied \"I was never asked during booking or check in what I wanted\" I was then told \"well, if you want to change to 2 beds I can transfer you to the front desk & you can see if they have anything available\" and I said \"no, I don't want the hassle I guess we can just share the bed\" and was told \"OK, sorry you are disappointed\".  The guest services person didn't offer to find out the 2 bed availability for me, she didn't offer to move us to a garden view room (which is still cheaper at its standard rate than the discounted rate we paid for the suite) or offer any other solutions either & I was really disappointed with that.\n\nOnce we got over the disappointment of our room we got dressed & hit the hotel to shop, eat, cocktail & check out the murals & water shows.  First off we tried to find the water show & weren't having any luck so we proceeded to shop & asked the woman working in one of the stores where we could find them & she said \"oh, they aren't running tonight\" so that was disappointing but we moved on to exploring the murals when we were then asked by a lovely gentleman to leave because of an event that was going on behind the closed doors of the area we were in.  After a couple hours of being at the hotel we were 0 for 4 so we decided to start drinking...we hit up Fuse & each had 1 drink & our bill was $19 so we moved on to dinner at Jack Daniels which was so good & reasonable priced.  I think our total bill was under $40 & we didn't have any drinks but we did have leftovers!!  After dinner there was nothing left to do so we went back to the room for some shut eye which was great until we got the luxury of listening to our neighbors have sex.  After all of that I took an Ambien & slept really well until about  7 am when I could hear people talking in the hallway & room doors closing one after the other.  My mom said she slept for s**t because of all of the noise & it was a shame too because the bed was so comfortable.  \n\nI'm sure that if everything we wanted to see & do would have been available to us this wouldn't have seemed like such a let down & the boring room wouldn't have been that big of a deal but considering that we weren't able to do anything that was on our list I would be hesitant to stay here again unless we had an atrium room so we could at least sit on the balcony & people watch.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, the lush greenery & the beautiful architecture as well as the shopping & food are all amazing but as a guest I left feeling pretty let down.", "date": "2012-03-01 21:23:50"}, {"_key": "1810461", "_id": "reviews/1810461", "_rev": "_fNyy19i---", "review_id": "4IJ7di36jsSkLYgl6uO3HA", "user_id": "UwNRwZ55zIScGZK2h_GAbw", "business_id": "sWCCxY1-9B1FGlSVeQvnHg", "stars": 5, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "Awesome lunch!!!!!

They have so many toppings, candies, fruits and sauces. It was so much fun choosing what you like and how much of it you wanted to add the the yogurt. At the end of the line they weigh your yogurt cup, so pricing always varies, but it seems fair. It was impressively clean everywhere, around the toppings, yogurt dispensers, tables, chairs, counters and floors. \nMy favorite yogurt flavor is cake batter.

While I love going there with friends to get together for whatever celebratory reason we can make up and have some delicious margaritas, I really don't enjoy the food that much. The food is really just not that good. Considering the great Mexican options we have now in the city since the Big \"K,\" I think that Superior Grill needs to make some recipe changes. They can keep the chips and salsa just the way they are, the guacamole is pretty good, but the queso could use some help, kinda tastes like they use a white version of Velveeta.  I mean I know there are some good melting Mexican cheeses out there that can help the queso situation they have going over there. Really I think the only good thing worth ordering in my opinion are the chicken or steak fajitas and sharing with someone. Now as for the beans and rice that come with the fajitas, that's where I think a recipe change needs to happen.  They have been serving those same rice and beans for as long as I can remember and boy are they boring and bland. They just don't have any flavor.  The tortillas they serve, while they may be homemade, they are just to heavy and greasy, you end up filling up on the tortilla and you still have tons meat left for the fajitas. The cheeseburgers are pretty good and huge, but they are kind of out of place at a Mexican restaurant, but my son isn't complaining about that. All the other things I have tried like the plain ole' cheese enchiladas or the tacos are nothing to rave about it all tastes so processed and fat laden, I'll go to Taqueria Corona for those. Like I said I am usually there not because I want a great meal but because I am with friends celebrating, and I think most people go for the same reason which is probably why the place does so well.

This time, I ordered the Highland Black Mocha Stout from Asheville, NC which went down ever-so smoothly. It was quite frankly like drinking velvet. I've had the Japa Milk Chai stout in the past and was similarly thrilled. ML Rose is to beer as Nashville is to country music: it is the definitive marker of what beer goes. Period.\n\nIf you happen to be a huge fan of bar food, this location does not disappoint. I particularly appreciated the generous portion on my Carolina Sweets order. So, let me explain this magnificent paragon of culinary achievement: perfectly crunchy sweet potato waffle fries hugged by dollops of pulled pork, all smothered with a carolina mustard bbq and kissed by a few diced green onions. Talk about food that hits every tastebud high note: savory, sweet, sour, and (with a kick of hot sauce from your table) just a bit spicy. I suggest saving the entire plate for yourself because you will not be inclined to share. Trust me, this dish inspires selfishness in us all. While I have tried the Five Alarm Burger, I admit that what truly sticks out is the Caroline Sweets dish due to satisfaction alone. Bar none.\n\nBecause we did come in such a large party, I do believe the waitstaff struggled to handle the numbers. Beers were delivered late or could not be ordered due to busyness, orders were forgotten or delivered to the wrong people. Common mishaps considering the huge party that we made up. However, the quality of my food and beer were still spot on, despite my beer gazing at me from afar (for far too long). \n\nI would suggest the Charlotte location if you are looking for a less busy location, but this one is fun since it has a lovely beer garden in the back.

I'll start by saying it is a strange ambiance because it is supposed to be an old speakeasy feel but there is a large screen TV in the front promoting their upstairs music venue. Don't get me wrong, I love the idea of bringing music into the mix (one of my fav. local bands actually played there the night after), but it just kind of takes away from the feel they were going for. \n\nIt was nice to see the bar pretty full on a Friday night, definitely not a common occurrence at the former, Liberties.\n\nMoving on. Their menu offers a large variety of food from sandwiches to \"pies\" and salads. Next time I have my eye on the pork belly banh mi sliders. I ordered the Reuban and it was very well executed and was the perfect amount of food for $10. The fiance ordered the smoked turkey sandwich and was also satisfied with his selection. The sandwiches come with a pickle and these house made parmesan chips that are off the chain. (It's $1 to sub in fries). We also ordered fried pickles, they were kind of bland, and doughy (I think the frier wasn't hot enough or they weren't swimming in there long enough). The sauce they came with was also kind of weird and too sweet. \n\nThe craft beer selection is decent but there are no prices listed on the board--and for a good reason. They are entirely too expensive, even for nolibs. \n\nI will probably stop back in another time to try out a cocktail and a few other menu items. Maybe I'll even catch a show.
