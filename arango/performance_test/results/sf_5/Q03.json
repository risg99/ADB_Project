As a 4 night guest at Hotel Palomar, the location of the restaurant is an obvious plus. The first night of my stay, I met a coworker in the restaurant for a cocktail. When we arrived, the host staff were busy and not available, so we just walked in. The restaurant was not too busy, so we just looked at a small table next to the bar and proceeded to take a seat. A waiter came by and I quickly asked if we could have a seat, before sitting down and told him we'd only be having cocktails. He stumbled on his reply, and in an irritated/in-convinced tone, told me \"I guess it would be fine\" and basically just kept walking mid sentence. My guest and I brushed it off, and started having a conversation while looking at the drink menu. To make a long story short, he was distant and we both got the \"couldn't be bothered\" vibe from him. When it came to the bill, we asked if it could be split due to company transaction policies, and you would have thought asked him for some inconceivable task. We basically spent the rest of our night and elevator ride to our room in shock of the rudeness we had just experienced. \n\nAlthough that situation left a bad taste in our mouth, and the night before we decided to avoid the restaurant, we decided to grab another cocktail and give this place one more try. After looking around and ensuring \"last nights waiter\" wasn't on shift, we walked over to the bar and started looking over the menu. Instantly, the bartender greeted us with pleasant small talk and made us feel 100% welcome. He asked about our day, recommended cocktails and was a completely genuine person. This guy (I think his name was Ben) is an absolute star! He gave us lessons on Whiskey, described how to make classic cocktails, and was 100% invested in our experience. This is exactly what a bartender at a 4/5 star establishment should be - actually he exceeds that. He was kind, funny, friendly and completely redeemed this restaurant/bar from our terrible experience the night before. \nI also ordered room service last night from this restaurant, and it was amazing. The bacon wrapped dates and chocolate cake are to die for! Great restaurant and amazing bartender(s).

The place is small, so definitely plan ahead. You will have to wait, so either you know, just do so, or perhaps try to visit outside of peak hours. Luckily, our wait was only about 20 minutes as the dinner rush was just leveling off.\n\nThe special was the local rock crab - $25 for 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, salad, and your choice of soup/chowder. After taking a look at a few trays of rock crab being served out, the wife and I both opted for it, as it looked awesome.  \n\nThe salad/chowder combo was great as you actually received hearty portions of each, so it was a good start. As much as I liked the chowder however, the Shrimp Bisque the wife ordered was amazing, so I would recommend that going forward. \n\nBut enough of prattling on about side dishes: the rock crab tasted just as glorious as it looked. Juicy, buttery chunks of white crab meat await you, just a few cracks away. While the rock crab shells are pretty thick, once cracked, they splinter and separate easily, a good sign they are cooked to perfection. The rock crabs provided a great amount of meat for what I felt to be the least amount of work you're going to do for crab, King or otherwise. \n\nWe were thoroughly satisfied with our meal and along with the special being an overall great value, devouring the Rock Crab at SBSC turned out to be one of the favorite meals on the trip.

I also enjoy the work hours - I've worked throughout the store, but most recently, I have been getting in my hours by participating in the membership committee. I wouldn't say that the community is necessarily made up of \"tree huggers\" and \"earth children\", though. The community is made up of a variety of similarly-minded folks from different backgrounds. I enjoy having a place to go to where I can obtain locally grown produce, a place that offers more natural, wholesome, and preservative-free foods than chain stores with prices way below that of Whole Foods. I enjoy interacting with other members and contributing to my local and global community. I don't find the membership fee or the work hours to be prohibitive being a single person vs. a family. I don't think that membership in a co-op is for everyone and, if you aren't single, it's definitely not a solo decision. If you're keen on being committed to the Weaver Way values, you couldn't find a better place to shop.

I'm freaked out.  I literally walk right out of the room down to the front desk.  I CANNOT!!!! They tell me they're sending a maintenance worker to handle it.  NOT GOOD ENOUGH! If there's one that's bold enough to show itself, he has other cohorts that prefer to live behind the scenes. They give us another room but tell me they can't do more until 8am.  No the room the move us too also has small spiders and other dead small bugs in the corners of the window. The TV doesn't work and one of the lamps doesn't have bulbs in it! COME ON!

However, so far I've had:  \n\nThe Quaker (Chicken version) - Delicious. They make their chicken steaks with the chunky chicken, which I like much more than the shredded version. They could season the chicken more, but the cheese was melted perfectly and the veggies were fresh. \n\nThe fries - crisp and flavorful. I didn't even need ketchup, and I always eat ketchup on my fries\n\nThe onion rings - a little greasy, but very tasty and crisp. The onions stayed in the breading and didn't slide out when you bit them (which I hate). \n\nSpanakopita - mine was a little over cooked, but the flavors were really good\n\nBaklava - VERY GOOD! \n\nSignature Salad - The veggies they use are very fresh which will make or break a salad. Their balsamic is great too!\n\nThe (turkey) Greek Burger - one of the best turkey burgers I've ever had! The patty was moist and flavorful all on its own, but then they top it with what must be homemade tzatziki. I could eat a bowl of that stuff! My burger had romaine instead of the advertised arugula, but it was very fresh, so I didn't mind as much. I also asked for feta, which I didn't get, but that sauce made me forget all about it. \n\nOverall, this place is great!

It wasn't.  I'm in Direct Sales and (like most people at this conference) don't have tons of extra money to spend on mediocre meals when I'm traveling.  $10 for a slice of generic pizza, small side salad and a soda for lunch.   I understand it's a hotel but there weren't any options close by.  Just getting your car from valet was a hassle and took a lot of time.  Being such a big property, it made getting to restaurants off the property really time intensive.  Since you're so far out of Nashville (out near the airport), the good little holes you find when you're in a city are pretty nonexistent.  \n\nThe property itself was great.  The hotel is HUGE but really pretty.  I enjoyed walking around but was really happy when I found what I didn't know existed...a shortcut between my room and the Convention Center.  It took my 10-15 minute walk down to about 3 minutes!  BONUS!  Like I said, this place is ginormous.  \n\nRoom: Our room was great.  I shared a wonderful suite in the Garden Conservatory with 2 other girls.  We were under a group rate and my friend was quoted $200/night, which is awesome for the space we had.  We had a large room (probably used as a hospitality suite for groups) for socializing.  It had a great bar area set-up and a nice big fridge and lots of drawer space.  Our bedroom was separated by doors that could be locked from either side (like an adjoining room), so it looked like the hospitality suite could be reserved without reserving the room.  It was different than what I was expecting, but whatevs.  It was fine.  So, I wasn't there at check-in.  The girl who reserved the room checked in a couple days earlier than my friend and I.  So, Sunday comes, and the bill was waiting for us when we woke up.  Our friend was charged $1200 for one room (I'm guessing the suite) and $1400 for the other room.  YEP.  She reserved what she thought was a 2 room suite for $200.  The bedroom door was closed when she got there and she asked them to open it up. It was all arranged by the bellman.  She was never told that the bedroom wasn't included....kind of necessary if you're staying over for 6 nights, dontcha think???  So, she's being charged $2600 for what was supposed to be $1200.  Last I heard, the Gaylord's legal department was investigating what she was told, what she wasn't told and if they should charge her the entire amount.  \n\nCheckout:  A FREAKING NIGHTMARE.  Between the money situation, which was not resolved as of late this week, and the 45 minute wait for a cart (in a hotel that holds thousands of people, you'd think they'd be plentiful and they aren't) and a 25 minute wait for the car, my friend and I decided to sweat it out and schlep our goods to the door where our car would be delivered to us.  It was not a short walk and we had a TON of stuff, which meant multiple trips.  UGH.\n\nI'm sure I'll be back for another conference (I am pretty sure my company has booked this for at least one more year....) but I'm not going to be happy about it.  I might even consider driving down, staying in a hotel somewhere downtown and driving out to the Conference stuff.", "date": "2013-08-03 16:26:48"}, {"_key": "1786292", "_id": "reviews/1786292", "_rev": "_fM0dMtq--O", "review_id": "kj5pjfid6pUP818rF0q6GQ", "user_id": "dWTrJdEPoZB8LkOPv_jxsA", "business_id": "cg4JFJcCxRTTMmcg9O9KtA", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This was my first time dining at Ava and I enjoyed most of it.

I tried to ask a question on the way out and was told I was not aloud to be there. Very strange since I was already there. It felt like I was being hurried out the door. Keeping in mind there were no other patients in the facility during our visit I was confuses about the wait time and gruf  behaviour. I found the experience to be very unfriendly.

Unless you're Italian, which I am.  Then this is something completely different.  Different in a good way, in my opinion, but very far off traditional Italian pizza.  The crust is whole wheat, and slightly sweet, and the toppings range from typical American to wild and wacky -- I'm looking at you marinated tempeh!\n\nI like that Mellow lets you customize your own meal -- not just for pizza toppings, but also for salads.  The Build-Your-Own salad is a great idea that gives you endless opportunity for variety.   The salad size is AMPLE, the choice of toppings is exceptional, and the dressings are very good.\n\nI also like that Mellow has something for everyone.  They have gluten-free crust available, and I hear they are working on vegan cheese, if they don't have it already.  Lest your meativore cohorts get nervous when they see vegan cheese, tofu and tempeh on the menu, assure them that they also have the full range of carnivore-approved toppings.  No one need go away hungry.\n\nBut I can't forget to mention the very best thing about Mellow -- their beer selection.  They take their beer VERY seriously at Mellow and provide their beer-loving customers with an ever-changing selection of artisan brews, both on tap and in bottles.  It's a very good place to explore what beer can be, although you should be warned, some selections are not for the beer-timid.  Their knowledgeable barman will be willing to help you make a selection that will please your sensibilities.\n\nWhich brings me to the main reason I didn't give dear old Mellow a 5-star review: if you fall in love with a beer here, drink up, because it will in all likelihood be gone the next time you visit.  Also, the selection changes faster than the printed menu, so they are often out of the first choice you make.  Nearly every visit sees my waitress going to bar and returning empty-handed when a beer listed on the menu is no longer in stock.  Sometimes more than once.  One time, it took me 4 tries to choose a brew that was still available.  It's a niggling complaint, but a little more consistency would be nice.", "date": "2010-08-24 19:14:21"}, {"_key": "1786325", "_id": "reviews/1786325", "_rev": "_fM0dMtq--v", "review_id": "lt-tsizQin_wNCkQv71YPQ", "user_id": "qWSAH4MzFbHV6UsseJVlZg", "business_id": "dUctvEfHQccW_uxtRup2QQ", "stars": 1, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I had a horrible experience here.

Since it was lunch, we went with a sandwich and a burger.  My wife's chicken salad was good but nothing teribbly unusual - which you might expect from chicken salad.  I had the Napa Valley burger.  The menu description made the burger sound very interesting - angus burger with an avacado spread, cheese, mixed field greens in a balsamic dressing with sliced sun-dried tomatos.  The burger was cooked to my liking and was well seasoned - there an number of what would be considered upscale burger places in the Nashville area that don't seem to know how to season ground beef and charge plenty more than Granite City.  My only complaint is that,as it turns out, the balsamic dressing in combination with the sun-dried tomatos over powered the delicate flavor of the avacado.  Additionally, the the chewy texture of the sun-dried tomatos fought with the tenderness of the ground beef.  Next time I will ask them to skip the tomatos.\n\nWe will return to try other menu items.

He is that good. The couple of times that I've strayed, I have been severely disappointed in the outcome. But I wasn't planning a trip back to Austin for a while and badly needed a cut, so I decided to bite the bullet.\n\nMy friend walks in a few weeks ago with *srsly* the cutest short hair cut. And so I ask her who and where, and she says Rodney Mitchell. I figured that this place would be too expensive, but she corrected my thinking on the matter. So I called to make an appointment with her guy (whose name I sadly cannot remember at the moment) and Rodney answered the phone. Turns out the guy my friend had seen didn't do morning appointments and all my afternoons were filled, so Rodney said \"look, I'm the owner, I can absolutely vouch for Allison who has several openings in the next few days.\" So I thought, alright, he's the owner so he knows his stuff--I'll do it.\n\nAllison absolutely did not disappoint. First off, she's a total sweetheart, but not super chatty (I appreciate stylists who can be content to both hold and not hold a convo while working) so there was no pressure there. I came in with my laptop and several photos I'd found that approximated what I wanted in a haircut, as I couldn't find exactly the right one. We talked about it a bit, discussed front and back length, bangs, etc. and she said alright and went to it. What she gave me was the cutest damn shaggy bob that I never thought possible. I seriously can't wait to go back.\n\nOne of the other awesome things about RMS is that they give you a discount for your first visit and I believe they have some kind of discount for students and teachers. They also will give you *another* discount when you refer people. So I got my friend a discount, and then referred a friend, so I'll get another discount when I go back for my next cut.

The combos come with choice of soup (got hot and sour) and also fried shrimp, crab Rangoon, and egg roll. The food came out quickly and when I got it home I noticed it seemed quite fresh (sometimes cheap Chinese food is a little slimy for my tastes) The duck was plentiful and delicious, maybe a little too salty for some, but I really like salt. The veggies were vibrant and not too hard, not too soft. The fried rice was kind of weird, it just looked and tasted like steamed rice that they added some soy sauce to. No veggies or meat in it.

I agree with one person's comment about its nothing like satco - THANK GOD!  I'm not sure why another person said it was....  and another thing, the college kids/frat boys HAVE found it, but hopefully they won't make it one of their new hang outs, as I didn't see buckets of beer on the menu.  \nSo the line issue will hopefully figure itself out because I don't think its a great idea....  It takes people forever to order so the line doesn't move very quickly (though maybe thats just how it was the night I was there, and since its a new place people are unfamiliar with the menu and take longer) but if there are open seats at the bar, I'd run over there and grab them and you don't have to wait in line - you can place your order at the bar.... although then you have to eat indoors.  \nThe staff seemed very friendly and eager to serve, which was a good thing.\nThe menu was small and simple... which is also nice sometimes.  Too many options can make choosing difficult!  They have about 8 different soft tacos and I think also about 6 different enchiladas..  all the tacos are $2.50.  They also serve up some sides like salsas, queso, and guac - all for a good price of less than $4.  I think they also had some other items but since I was there for tacos, I didn't really read them.  The southern fried taco wasn't too exciting - just some fried chicken and a sweet sauce in a taco - so i'd pass on that one.  The korean bbq one I thought was really tasty - great flavor to it!  My boyfriend had the fish taco - he said it was good, but not great - and he also had the spicy shrimp taco which he said was excellent... and now wants to keep going back just for that taco - apparently its super super spicy so beware!\nI liked the queso, I didn't think it resembled gross melted down cheese like someone else mentioned.  it was creamy and tasty.  served its purpose!\nThey also had an interesting drink menu - I'm gonna try the \"lojito\" next time I go - which was basically a mojito that uses a local rum in it.  \nSo all in all - I thought it was a great place - its super affordable, it can be quick if your timing is right, and they had some really interesting fun flavors instead of your standard boring tacos.  I mean \"Kelly P\" if you want boring standard tacos - then go to SATCO, or las palmas or whatever mexican restaurant you're used to going to - this place is for interesting flavors, proper portion sizes, good prices and quality food.  \n\nOh and they valet park - which I hate using, but its convenient when theres no parking spaces!\n\n***** UPDATE ******\n\nSo I went back to Local Taco last weekend and decided to remove a star from my review.  First of all - the music they were playing was VERY LOUD.  Now - Loud music doesn't necessarily upset me, but I had to yell across the table to speak to my boyfriend during the meal!  YELL.  Not only that -  but the music they wanted to blast... was Maroon 5!!!!!  WHAT?? And not just a song - BUT THE WHOLE ALBUM.  I HATE that band - so it totally ruined my whole experience in there.  Why on earth would you play an entire album at a restaurant?  There is a reason for the radio or mixes... so your music can appeal to the masses... not single them out.  jesus.  it was terrible!\nOk so on top of the awful loud music - there were flies buzzing around us the whole time (and we were eating inside due to the intense heat outside)..  they were swarming our table.  Very unpleasant experience.\nTo top it off - about 2 hours later, both of us were experiencing sour stomachs..   \nThis really upsets me because I really really wanted to like this place, but after this last visit I don't think I want to return.", "date": "2009-05-23 22:51:32"}, {"_key": "1786387", "_id": "reviews/1786387", "_rev": "_fM0dMtq-_t", "review_id": "KZaBBKr4uWWK1TpqiBMUMg", "user_id": "2khAy7DTp3dUmeDJ4ZYw6Q", "business_id": "cBp1fn2LXpSHe4VbTXLYEw", "stars": 5, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "Finally had the chance to stop by Bab Cafe...what took us so long!

First off, they were re-seeding, so it's understandable that the course was under 'duress'. The price was $29, you could not drive a cart off the path, the fairways looked great, obviously soaked in water for the over seeding, and the greens were effectively sand mats. To start they placed a single behind our party of 4 so we immediately had to let the individual behind us play through. All of this was fine until the sprinklers began pumping water into our round. Again, I know that they were over seeding, but we and many others were on the course when sprinklers kicked into full swing behind, ahead, and on top of us. Literally, we were surprise sprayed by popping sprinklers. Let's be clear here, I am not a professional greens keeper, and I do not claim to be an expert in watering of grass in a desert environment, but when people are playing through the course I feel it's fair that the sprinklers are monitored to allow their patrons to enjoy the experience. To finish this off, I am writing this review not because of the conditions, but because of the unacceptable courtesy of the two individuals in the proshop.

I got shrimp, he got chicken and our buddy got pulled pork. I asked my boyfriend if he wanted a bite of mine and he sort of pulled back and said 'no, i mean, obviously we're going to be coming back, so we can just try a different type next time'.\n\nDude loved his chicken taco. And I loved my shrimp taco! I hear the pulled pork tacos were also pretty magnificent. The chips and guacamole were delicious, but for the price I would like a little more guacamole. The spicy rim margarita really hit the spot and was a great accompaniment to the tacos and, at $5.50, i think they were reasonably priced. (I had 5) but what I don't like to see with any margarita is a bartender pulling out a jigger and measuring precisely two jiggers of booze. For that, you get four stars, revolucion. live a little! get me greased up, liquored up, super slick and oil my gears!\n\nThe fried potatoes were pretty 'meh', but the 'pink death' hot sauce was killer.

We were able to use the Lobby and Tap Room for some of our wedding photographs too, and they all look wonderful!\n\nThe rooms are very pleasant and quaint and our guests all complimented on how clean and cozy they were.  The prices were also wonderful and our guests were able to enjoy downtown St. Pete because of the great location.  The shuttle is also very convenient and a great experience for guests!\n\nThe brunch was perfect.  Not only was the price great for an all-you-can-enjoy feast, but the food is delicious and homemade.  The wonderful gentleman who makes the omelets is friendly, fast, and takes great pride in his work.  He is also a talented baker and I couldn't get enough of the chocolate muffins he made!

I basically showed up at Pure, told the designer, Jeremy, my price point, and asked what he could do for me.  I half expected this approach would be met with disdain, but Jeremy couldn't have been more friendly or helpful.  He asked me about my style and suggested cost-effective blooms (like hydrangea, because they are large and will make for a bigger arrangement) that perfectly fit my style (on the conservative side).  I also called and changed my order several times in the week prior to the wedding.  Pure was incredibly accommodating and on the big day, everything was exactly as I had requested.

One bartender didn't even know there was a new cocktail menu.  The cocktail was weak and watery, and the liquors they have here and throughout Peppermill are the most unfortunate corporate types.  The service is also very spotty.  It confounded me how four bartenders could not seem to handle about 45 customers.  They didn't have any bar areas, so they all floated around the circle, but then they'd stop, often just short of me and go to the waitress stations to fill their orders.  You can't really build up any rapport with four bartenders floating around trying to serve everyone.  I also hated the people there.  Sorry, but many were your run-of-the-mill casino gamblers.  Why don't you just sit at a machine and play?  You didn't come here for the drinks or to smooze with the bartenders, so seriously, go sit at a machine.  One just sat next to me and lite up a cancer stick and the smoke just blew in my face.  Look, if I walk into a bar and sit next to someone, it's their turf.  They can smoke, fart, vomit on themselves, if I don't like it I can leave.  But if I'm there, it's my turf.  Don't come sit next to me and smoke, fart, or vomit all over yourself.  Or at least be frickin thoughtful and if you see your smoke wafting in my face, put your cancer stick and tray on the other side of the bar so it wafts in your face.  Oh, you don't like smoke in your face???  Me neither moron.

I was nervous when they said they didn't have kaiser rolls so I went with a hamburger roll.  It was an excellent decision.  The roll was excellent - not just an average cheap hamburger roll.  They layered the cheese on the sandwich, which to me is a must for a true egg sandwich.  It was served with home fries, which were sauteed with large slices of peppers and onions.  I'm not the biggest breakfast potatoes fan, but these were great and I appreciated that they didn't clearly just scoop some food from a huge pile of pre-cooked home fries.\n\nThe pancakes were great and fluffy.  My one gripe was their use of smuckers pre-packaged syrup.  I realize that if they put syrup in a container, it probably wouldn't be real maple syrup, but I sort of wish I didn't know that they were giving me sub-par syrup.\n\nThe server was friendly and very attentive.  The coffee refills were constant, and the coffee was actually good (so many diners fail at coffee).

However, there was an unfortunate incident where someone (not our server) on the waitstaff knocked a glass of water on one of us and spilled our bottle of wine on the floor. No wine got on either of us, and we were very understanding - mistakes happen. We get it.

One of about three people hurriedly cleaning us up promised us 2 extra glasses to make up for the wine that had soaked into the carpet. Finally, the gentleman who made the mistake was very apologetic. Up until this point - totally fine. \n\nThen, after a few minutes of everyone, including our formerly-friendly server, avoiding us like they heard there was a sudden outbreak of the Zika virus at our table, our server finally resurfaced to refill water. When one of us asked whether that wine was coming out (after all, someone we hadn't met before promised it then disappeared), rather than reassuring us, this was the response, verbatim: \"You didn't finish the bottle yet. We were going to bring it out when you finished the bottle.\" Excuse me? \n\nAfter the flippant response, our waitstaff's avoidant behavior continued. We finished our bottle of wine with dinner, then ordered a dessert (hey, maybe this would give them a chance to be reminded by the wine stain in the carpet that they promised to compensate us for our overpriced loss with a glass?).  Frustrated, we asked for the check.

On the merits of the wine, fairly average... I understand that the winery has more than one lable and other label is their premium wines.  I look forward to when that is available (I went two weeks ago so maybe it already is)     Location..   what's not to like?  On the pier!  A wonderful outdoor patio,  couldn't have a nicer setting to enjoy your tasting....   The staff were super, super nice,  I would give them an A+!  \n\nSo why only three stars?  It is because of the wine club!  Very expensive for the quality of the wines and stingy as HELL with the benefits to the members..   Most wine clubs will give you a free tasting every time you come in (after all, we are your best customers... we are the ones who buy your wine time and time again).  Some wineries will give their members a complimentary glass in leau of a tasting (Carr).   Most wineries allow you to bring guests which is how you get new wine club members.   This system works folks!  The way this wine club works is that you are given a very limited number of passes per quarter, five as I recall.   If I come with my wife once a month we wouldn't even be covered... let alone if we bring a guest!   \n\nSo go to this winery if you want to enjoy a tasting in one of the most beautiful settings on earth.

It was objectively a horrible experience, even without comparing it to the hype it receives, and ruined what was supposed to be a nice birthday dinner celebration. \n\nWe had a group of 8 that had a reservation made well in advance. Short wait, but not too bad. Keep in mind, it seemed like a normal Friday night, but weren't super busy or at-capacity.\n\nIt was a birthday dinner, so I told the hostesses that it was her birthday, and asked if they could bring out something for her at the end of the meal, which was acknowledged. Pretty standard stuff, whether at a Applebee's or the French Laundry. We were sat at a booth right next to the Maitre D' stand, and next to all the wait staff's home base, so pretty much no excuse for not getting any attention. \n\nAfter getting us waters, it took them a LONG time to even come by and acknowledge us. After ordering wine, it took them another good 15-20 minutes to even bring us our wine, and no one even checked in on us! (hint: if you're running a restaurant, wine is your profit center and doesn't take any work other than taking a bottle off a shelf and opening it. bring it out ASAP...). \n\nAfter ordering food, it was more of the same...a long wait for food to start coming out and no one checking in on us AT ALL. We drank the bottles we ordered and had to get up and flag someone down to get another wine order. A couple of us even got up during the meal to remind them to bring out something for birthday girl at the end of the meal. \n\nOnce our meal was done and taken away, we were given dessert menus and the server disappeared for 10-15 minutes... AGAIN. After coming back, he asked what dessert we wanted, so we ordered some coffees... and waited... and waited. Eventually we got up and asked him what was going on and if they were going to bring anything out like we asked multiple times. \n\nThey finally brought out a couple of cookies with a candle...\n\nIn summary, the food was pretty hit or miss, pretty mediocre for this price point. Whipped feta, like other reviews have said, was amazing, and the Braised Lamb was really good. But the Sirloin was chewy and bland and the Grilled Caesar tasted like a soggy, luke-warm, wilted mess (two orders were left untouched by a group of 8). Atmosphere was nice and trendy. But the service, which is a huge reason to spend your hard-earned $ at a restaurant, was absolutely horrendous. \n\nI really love going to cool, popular restaurants and having a great time, and I hate writing such a negative review, but I had to share my experience, especially for a restaurant that is getting an awful lot of (undeserved) hype.", "date": "2017-09-09 00:09:15"}, {"_key": "1786591", "_id": "reviews/1786591", "_rev": "_fM0dMtu-Av", "review_id": "yCqvkiikFpc1dvRRfU2iNw", "user_id": "6IrjDYZE8J9oF5WfaOugpA", "business_id": "-kY_HDP7IMvGl-kBIZVU4A", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "text": "I visited the French Press on my most recent trip to Santa Barbara, it was a pleasant establishment compounded with the pleasant company of those I was with, and those at the tables around us.

Everybody here raves about the restaurants, but I have yet to find many that deserve five stars, or even four.  This is the best restaurant I have eaten in in Philadelphia.  \n\nTahini and bread  arrived at the table, and I thought, hum, plain but I'm hungry.  They must put crack in that Tahini.  I wanted to lap it out of the bowl like an uncouth dog.  The bread is excellent too.\n\nI love a menu with many organic meat choices.  How often can you order an organic beef shishkabob?  It was superb.  The meat done perfectly, the onions nearly caramelized but not quite so they still had some substantive crunch.  The purslane salad tasted like I was eating a plant in the middle of a garden.  It is not often that I dream about a salad but I do dream about this one\n\nMy husband had a chicken dish with black eyed peas and green peas and fantastic rice.  I won't begin to describe the flavoring; it is beyond my culinary vocabulary.  We asked what spices they use, and in addition to traditional zatar, they use their own blend of spices.  I don't even need to know what is in it just so long as we can keep coming back and ordering it again and again.\n\nI was so full but ate dessert none the less, which I usually don't do.  But when a diner is this good, I had a feeling the desserts would be too and I just needed to find out.  Pistachio creme brulee.  It could have come out over the top, but no indeed.  It was pure pistachio heaven in s super light yet rich custard.  Heaven. Heaven.\n\nOur service was superb.  The squeezed us into a last minute Friday night reservation with the caveat that we would need to get through our dinner in an hour and 15 minutes in order to accommodate a reservation made prior to us.  Given the time constraints they never made us feel rushed and timed the meal perfectly.  Then my husband left to go to the restroom, the waiter picked up his napkin and refolded it nicely on the table.  Do I care about the napkin placement in the middle of a meal?  Not really, but it is a sign that the waitstaff is incredibly attentive and extremely well trained.  \n\nMy eating out plan for Philly might just be to skip eating most everywhere most of the time so I can frequent this expensive, though appropriately priced restaurant.

The people here are the rudest people I have ever come across, and that factors in for the fact that they have to work at the DMV and deal with idiots all day\n\nLet's see --first visit the person at the front desk turned me away because I didn't know you needed to bring a personal check or money order and wouldn't even let me get a number if didn't show her I had all my documents were ready to be processed- well I thought,  ok the website doesn't say you only take checks but OK, this is my fault and they mean business here! \n\nSecond visit I was told the wait was 2 hours - they are only open during the hours I work 8:30-4:30 so basically you have to miss work to go to the location in South Philly. I had to go back to work so I, yet again, assumed it was on me to figure out how to do this the right way. I'll try again, I told myself.\n\nThird visit I was prepared - I had all my paperwork--took 2 hours off work- and I was told the wait was 1 hour 23 minutes. I'm going to do this!! I was number 748 and they were on number 730 when I sat down. Score! Over an hour later, the TWO people working there had only gotten through 4 people. One woman spent the whole time waiting on the same person who looked like he handed her a paperclip and a plastic bag and she made all kinds of calls to try to get his documentation (remember I can't even get in the building without showing mine)... the other person working there, while he was moving at a faster pace, took 2 people in a row who didn't have numbers. Then a man came over and said \"My sister so and so is coming\" and the woman nodded. 15 minutes later, the line hadn't moved at all and just before the man called the next number (number 735- still nowhere near me ) a woman comes up and announces she is so and so's sister and with no number, no line, no waiting, gets to go and give her paperwork in and was promptly waited on. Now, after 90 minutes and the line only moving 5 people my patience was wearing very thin. I complained about what was going on and I was told that \"oh honey those people were here earlier and lost their numbers\" OH YEA RIGHT. Then the woman finishes with \"paperclip no documents man\" and announces she is \"going on break\" and gets up and walks around and starts playing with so and so's sister's baby while she gets waiting on and the rest of us sit there like total fools. \n\nI left and will never go back. If you no choice but to go to this location, take a day off work and get there as soon as they open. Also know that your number means nothing and the wait will be over 2 hours.

I left a voicemail and still no call at closing time.  Monday morning I arrived at the dealership as they were opening.  I asked Stephen, the salesman what they determined.  He instructed me to have a seat and he would talk to his management team.  One hour + later, I was called into a cubicle and told my loan had been funded and the title had been changed.  Therefore, I would have to sell the car back to the dealership as a used car.  I would lose a lot of money in doing this.  This morning, Bill head of finance advised that the bank had questions about funding the loan.  I received a call from the bank stating the loan had NOT been funded and they would be unable to okay the loan.  I have left numerous messages with the dealership and have yet to receive a callback.

My boyfriend got the two-meat plate with brisket and pulled chicken with potato salad and fries. The food blew us both away! It was delicious from beginning to end. The pulled pork was perfect and had the perfect amount of sauce without being drenched. I could tell that if I hadn't ordered it wet it still would have been able to stand on it's own. The mac and cheese was incredible, and after the pork, was my favorite part of the meal. The stone ground grits had a different type of flavor (almost smoky) that I enjoyed and the potato salad was served cold and had that nice crunch that I like in potato salad,\n\nWe both agreed that the food was excellent, and a good deal to boot, and that we would both make the trip back out to Earhart, just to have more of this delicious food.

Iris excels in every area: food, drinks, service, atmosphere, location, music and overall graciousness. I made the reservation for 10-15 people, not knowing exactly how many in my party would show up. Iris pulled out all the stops to make sure everyone had comfortable seating and even prepared an overflow table for us. At no time did we feel jostled or rushed, which is a common fine dining concern. \n\nThe layout of the restaurant allowed diners to move freely to and from the table and to exchange seats as needed. The music selection was fun and unique, ranging from the Magnetic Fields to Johnny Cash. It was also quiet enough to be enjoyed while allowing conversation to flow unimpeded. Our waiter had excellent timing and anticipated our every need. \n\nThough they don't have a full drink menu for lunch (I hear they have an amazing mixologist for the dinner hour) they do offer a selection of martinis and wines. One of the guests has accounts with several high-end bars in the Quarter, and the drink list passed his muster. Our table settled for Chardonnays, Perseco and chilled shots of Chartreuse, though I hear they have several types of absinthe as well. \n\nOur group began with slices of warm, heavenly bread that Iris bakes in house. We continued with an assortment of salads--I had the Hollygrove arugula with warm goat cheese, ni\u00e7oise olives and balsamic vinaigrette. It was fresh perfection. A few of us opted for the mussels, which I heard were delicious. For my main course, I had a wonderful drum with onions prepared in a tangy soy reduction, which was an elegant complement for the fish. I also heard rave reviews about the gnocci and chicken. \n\nAll the entrees were creatively arranged and selected, and at no point did I feel overwhelmed or that any fuss or pretense had gone into the food. I also appreciated that the portions were European-sized (it always makes me laugh when other Americans list too-small portion size as a complaint even when the food is well-prepared!). Iris prepares a lot of their basic ingredients in-house, and I appreciate that the kitchen makes a point of incorporating gulf fish and produce purchased from local, farmer-friendly markets. \n\nWe settled on the prix fixe menu, which was $20 a person for appetizer, main course and the dessert of the day (the best strawberry sorbet I have had yet). With the added drinks and tip it came out to under $35 a person, which is an excellent price for such a delicious white-linen lunch.

She was so methodical, took her time to figure out what was best for me and talked me through it all. She in no way gave me false hope so my expectations were clear. I appreciated that, because when it comes to your hair, you want to know what to expect when you walk out of the salon. Especially with the color correction. Nichole explained that the best option would be a balayage, along with explaining that a balayage builds on itself and each time it would get easier and better -- all of which has proved true. \n\nNichole has learned the in's and out's of my hair. The color is stunning, the cuts are perfect, the styling is above and beyond. \n\nI walked in to see Nichole for the first time feeling horrible about myself and walked out feeling empowered and amazing.

The Adana kebab was particularly tender, juicy, and tasty.  I had never had Adana kebab before and will be ordering it again.  I shared a taste with my Mother in law and she loved it too!  mom in law had crab cakes and she enjoyed them very much.  My wife had the French onion soup, which she raves about and always orders.  She also had the roast turkey, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, and corn.  She loved everything on that platter.  She commented that the gravy was especially good.  The portion sizes are huge and we love to have the left overs again at home.

We wanted to eat somewhere fun and elegant over the holidays, and Muriel's fit the bill. Overall, it was a leisurely dining experience in a nice atmosphere, but there were some missteps.\n\nFirst, the menu and prices on the website were different than what we were given in the restaurant. Not a big deal unless you have your heart set on something before you go.\n\nThen, we were served in a weird order. Three of us ordered the prix fixe menu, which includes appetizer, entree and dessert. One friend also ordered a salad and I ordered an oyster appetizer in addition to our prix fixe dinner. \n\nFirst, my two friends got their goat cheese crepe appetizer and I got my oysters. Then, after we ate that, they brought out MY goat cheese appetizer and my friend's salad. I would have thought they would have brought our oysters and salad first, then bring all of the goat cheese appetizers, but whatever.\n\nThe oyster appetizer was simply okay: fried oysters set atop shells containing creamed spinach. The parmesan cheese on top was crunchy and not pliable. Obviously not their signature dish.\n\nThe shrimp and goat cheese crepes were to die for. The crepe was light and tender and the cheese filling was creamy and savory. There was something off with the shrimp though...they were those transparent shrimp, I don't think they were gulf shrimp.\n\nFor my entree, I had the pecan crusted puppy drum. Only certain bites of it were flavorful for some reason. I tasted my friend's chicken and it was terribly dry. I tasted the other friend's barbeque shrimp, it was so delicious, it made me regret ordering the fish.\n\nThe flourless chocolate cake was really good. The servers (all women) were very professional.\n\nMy dining companions and I all dressed up, but there were many diners there in jeans and t-shirts.\n\nTIP: Do not park in the French Market lot behind Cafe du Monde. Muriel's validates for up to 3 hours, so it's very tempting. The lot is dark and isolated and there are not visible security personnel around. When we were going back to our car, there was a guy in an alley, sitting on a bike. As soon as we passed, he pulled out and rode behind us all the way to the entrance of the lot. When we turned right to go to our car, he rode off to the left, and we breathed a temporary sigh of relief. Within two seconds, he made a u-turn and started pedaling to catch up to us. My friend and I RAN to the car and jumped in, and he rode past us, circling the lot. When we got to the ticket booth, we informed the cashier that a man on a bike was lurking around the lot and we asked if they had a security person who could pass through the lot. She acted like she couldn't understand what we were saying and waved us off with a a dismissive, \"Okay, okay.\"  Pay the extra money and park in a more populated, well-lighted area.", "date": "2013-01-02 17:47:24"}, {"_key": "1786756", "_id": "reviews/1786756", "_rev": "_fM0dMty-Ad", "review_id": "FVj05hX11ZowAz3k9EN5_g", "user_id": "bcHgPhn8sgmgMR-IkmL0Jw", "business_id": "VYTFqb1NVLleeStQaUEP0Q", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Checked this out with the boyfriend and his parents.

He told us \"Don't worry, we're going to rewind it for you so you don't have to miss the ending! Just go have a seat, we'll get it all fixed\".  \nWe were pleasantly relieved so we went back inside to have a seat. 5 minutes later, watching the silent film continuing to unfold before us, we started to realize we may have been lied to. We walked out again and told the manager (who was still waiting there) that it hadn't been rewound yet. He stammered a vague apology and said they were \"working on some technical difficulties\" but assured us that \"we will rewind it soon\".\n\nI told him that it was too late, the ending was already spoiled, so we had no interest in going back to see it a second time. So he asks us to follow him for some freebie tickets for my next visit(which I didn't even want; I just wanted to see my movie that night. Babysitters aren't always easy to come by!)\nThis would've been almost acceptable, but here's the worst part: Two girls lined up for the same theatre we had just left. He told them \"hold tight, we'll be starting your movie soon!\" right in front of me! \nSo I asked him, right in front of them, \"Which is it? Are you going to fix the broken speakers and rewind the ending? Or start the next movie without any sound? Your stories don't match up, so which one of us are you lying to?\"  \n  \nHe stammered another apology (and admitted that they were starting the next movie, NOT rewinding the first one). He then gave us popcorn coupons. Whooptie doo. I don't want to sound entitled, it's not like I demanded anything at all. I really couldn't care less if they didn't give us any coupons, but I found this insulting after we had been lied to so many times. I would've rather heard an explanation for why they thought it was acceptable to lie to us to get us back in our seats.\n\nI just wish they'd be a bit more respectful and honest with their customers. Our date night was ruined and the management very obviously tried to placate us with whatever story they could come up with. And in the process, they spoiled the ending by convincing us to watch most of it silently under the false pretense that it would be fixed and rewound. If they had just told us the truth, we would've left and the ending would not have been ruined, and we would have had an earlier start for the remains of our evening.", "date": "2012-07-17 20:12:11"}, {"_key": "1786769", "_id": "reviews/1786769", "_rev": "_fM0dMty-Aq", "review_id": "gT8VZEFz7QBPMu4yUZKXtg", "user_id": "YJnijkDk-FZZComB9WHQog", "business_id": "GBTPC53ZrG1ZBY3DT8Mbcw", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "One of the best dinners I've ever had!

Definitely a cool place to meet up with friends. It's very pricey but the foods are tasty, different and beautifully presented.\n\nMy all time favorite dish so far has been the griddled mushrooms! These are so freaking delicious! If you love mushrooms, definitely try this! My friends and I ordered four servings ($8 per small plate) in one sitting. We'd share one small plate, then decide...just one more. There's a poached egg served on top. I recommend poking the egg and letting the yolk coat the mushrooms. Trust me. The mushrooms are cooked to perfection. There's just a bit of a crunch when you bite. Not too soft that can eat them without chewing. Honestly, these mushrooms taste like heaven in your mouth!\n\nI also liked the popcorn chicken ($9 for bowl of about 10-12). At first glance, these look like donut holes. But in a way, they also remind me of the chicken balls, you might find in a Chinese food buffet. The outside is crunchy and dusted with popcorn. The round ball of chicken inside is soft. At times, I found the section between the outer crunchy part and just around the chicken, a bit doughy. It would also be nice if there was some sort of sauce to dip these into, for extra flavor. My friends and I ordered a total of three bowls. I definitely recommend sharing. After eating three chicken balls, I personally had my fill. \n\nAnother beautifully presented and tasty dish, is the crunch salad for $13. This dish looks like a tower of fancy shredded coleslaw. It's made with raw, pickled and fried veggies. When brought to your table, the servers pour the house made dressing, around and on top of this tower. All the while, you're thinking, WOW. Fancy! It's so pretty, you kind of feel bad tearing it down to eat it. Good thing it tastes as good as it looks! It tastes fresh and has just the right amount of dressing. We had two orders of this salad.\n\nLast but not least, we had the potato and squash gnocchi for $25. Ironically, the most expensive dish we ordered, was the biggest disappointment. I generally love eating duck. However, one taste of the gnocchi made me turned off by this dish. Hard to explain exactly why. My friend described it as \"too strong of a taste.\" You know how lamb has a distinct taste? Well this dish had a strong taste, but unfortunately, in my opinion, not a good tasting one. The weird thing was, my other friend, who is generally more picky with food, actually ate all the duck meat. He also said he also liked the taste of the broth. In the end, the only thing left in the bowl was the gnocchi. It just had too much of that \"too strong taste\" infused into it.\n\nOverall, even though I didn't love all the dishes during this visit, I still would recommend trying this place out.

We also asked about a table for 6 that was empty, as there were 5 of us, and were told that this table was reserved. When I pointed out that I had called prior the day before and was told that there are no reservations, the hostess just starred at me blankly. Once seated, there was a mix up with the wait staff regarding which waiter was to serve us, no big deal. We ordered drinks, an appetizer, and dinner as soon as that was ironed out, and the waiter was pleasant and apologetic. We asked for bread and got it, drinks came soon and we were off to a better start until 30 min later they brought out clams when we ordered raw oysters, when we explained to the food runner that we didn't order clams, he said that they ran out of oysters and clams was all they had. This was an odd explanation, and we sent the clams back of course. My daughter's Caesar salad was overdressed and had large bits of anchovy, so she didn't eat much of it. After waiting for over an hour for dinner (after we had ordered), my grilled shrimp, and rice on the plate arrived to the table cold and half of the shrimp were burnt. I was hungry and tired, it was late, so I just ate the shrimp and rice. The waiter was apologetic for the wait and seemed to be trying very hard. There were two tables that needed to be cleared nearby almost the entire 2 1/2 hours we were sitting there with food all over the floor, it was disgusting. I thought to myself that one of the 3 hostesses should have stepped in to help instead of standing around an empty lobby with a sour look on their faces.

Their biggest mistake is not having a customer service department. They rely on their sales team to provide customer service meaning every time you call in to try and get something done, you get put into a voicemail because the sales guy is out selling - which should be their only job. This left me on numerous occassions incredibly frustrated that I could not get an answer. I even left the manager a voicemail (big surprise I couldn't get them to answer) and they never had the decency to call me back - Just made my sales person call me back.\n\nI purchased my car last July and was promised numerous things would be done to the car before I purchased it. One of which being the tint on the rear window would be removed as the view out of the back was blurry. Somehow, that passed thru inspection and when I came to sign the papers, I noticed that it was still on the back windshield. I was told that they would have it removed by the time we were done the paperwork. Also, I was told that the price was going to be higher than the original agreement because the sales manager did the math wrong the previous day when we ran numbers. I told him that wasn't my fault and I would only pay the agreed upon amount and he spoke with the manager and got it sorted out. \n\nAfter sitting in the office for 2.5 hours, they finally told me that they were unable to even start taking off the tint and I would have to bring the car back. I dropped it off that Friday and let them keep it for the weekend. My sales guy called me on Saturday night to tell me that they never got to finish it and I would have to bring it back again and leave it. I live 45 minutes from the dealership so this isn't something I can easily do. I insisted on them giving me a loaner car for whatever day they would do this as I was sure this wouldn't be a one day process from my previous experience. 2.5 weeks later they were able to provide me with said car and I dropped off my vehicle. When I went to pick up my \"finished car\" there was still tint left on the bottom of the windshield. \n\nAfter all of that I knew I would never bring my car back for service there if that's the kind of service they provide. Now with all the rain we've been having, my trunk is leaking and when I called to check with the service department to see if it would be covered under warranty, I got the same run around with the service department who just said \"I don't know\" - OK well give me someone who will be able to tell me. Once they forwarded me to the correct person, I again got \"I don't know\". We need you to bring it in and look at it then submit to our warranty company to see if it gets accepted. No thanks after my previous experience of bringing my car in there to get \"serviced\". \n\nInvest in a customer service department to handle complaints in a professional and timely matter. This should not in any way be left upon the sales department to do. My sales guy did the best he could and I appreciated the help he gave me, but no one else would help me throughout the entire process.

The second time I brought my mother and she ordered a cheese quesadilla, when it came out it was just slices of cheese ONTOP of a folded tortilla, we spoke to the manager about it who told us we were wrong about wanting to order something different. So today I decided to give this place ONE last chance. Came in with my boyfriend and kids. We ordered two Reuben's. One pastrami, one corn beef and we split them as we always have. The kids ordered typical kids meals. When our food came out the Rye was completely under toasted and the fries were not well done. As a server myself I know that the cooks don't always listen to what the ticket said. One of the kids meals was completely over cooked, and the other was under cooked! (Roasted turkey under cooked, chicken fingers over cooked) The manager/host came up to the stand (which was directly behind us) and started coughing very loudly. I turned around to make sure he was ok and he's facing my table and coughing without covering his mouth! At that point I had enough! I politely asked our waitress for a box & the check. When I went up to pay the same manager/host was there to cash me out, didn't even ask how everything was just grabbed the money out of my hand! The entire time I was there the manager/host was yelling at the busser about cleaning tables; from what I saw the busser moved very quickly and there was only one busser from what I saw so yelling at him was uncalled for especially in front of guests! He also yelled across the restaurant several times for \"Ashley\" to come get a beer for another server, instead of just walking his lazy a** the 5 feet to the table it needed to go to! And last but not least, the manager gave me and the kids a dirty look and scoffed when one of the children asked if he could go give our server her tip, which is completely uncalled for and unprofessional! I told him yes but he needed to wait until she was done at the table, which he did. He then waited for her by our table and handed her the tip and smiled. She was very polite to all 4 of us and addressed any and all concerns we had! I'd suggest my server find a job elsewhere, she was absolutely fantastic and the ONLY reason I'm even giving 1 star! I will NEVER be back unless the management changes!!!!! I have been a server for over 10 years now so I know what is expected out of servers, bussers & management and this manager was by far one of the WORST I've ever seen in any restaurant!

Pollo a la brasa.... Rotisserie chicken.... Whatever you wanna call it.... I call it a technique done here with love and pride. Lets be clear, you will find no comparison coming from your grocer deli section or at the checkout isle.\n\nWhy do I think this chicken have some TLC put into it? On biting down of this chicken you can note seasoning flavors down to the bone. This is an inclination that prior to even getting into the rotisserie oven, these birds spend some time in some form of marinating process. Building flavor, the chicken also has a seasoning rub all over the skin.\n\nLets go to this rotisserie oven. Another unique element is this oven has a charcoal or grill like component. This gives the chicken a smoky element in the flavor build. As these birds turn in this oven, they keep moist from the natural drippings dropping from bird to bird as they rotate through this oven. In turn, this a reason why some people may note some pieces the skin end up dry and crispy and others get moist or soggy skin on their chicken In the end, you end up with this tender, smoky, well seasoned, fall off the bone goodness. Wait.... how can they add more flavor? Cuenelli's serves it with two dipping sauces, a chimichurri  which gives a herbaceous and slightly spicy flavor, and an aioli which has a garlicky - lemony element.\n\nRound out this meal with some solid sides. Must haves for me would be the cilantro rice. Another herbaceous addition that works well with this meal. I got to use the word herbaceous a few times in this review, it has reflects such great imagery for food talk:) Must have beans with rice no? I pick the spicy pinto beans over the black beans at this establishment but lets be clear these beans are pretty spicy. I also love the maduros here. These sweet plantatains are cooked to perfection where the outsides has this caramelization from the natural sugar of the sweet plantain, leaving you with this toffee-like, stick to your tooth exterior and soft and sweet interior. \n\nWash all down with Inca cola or a bottle of chicha limena.  Inca cola is almost like a cola champagne or a cream soda type of drink. Chicha Limena I say is Christmas in a bottle. This juice has a floral base blended with cinnamon and cloves.\n\nThough Cuenelli's Peruvian Style Rotisserie Chicken have many other notable Latin dishes, the one thing that comes to mind to me is this chicken made with love. This chicken gives new meaning to all who thought they knew what rotisserie chicken is.

Big portions at decent prices. You won't leave hungry!\n\nAnd now for a full review:\n\nI have been to this Fellini's Cafe and the one in Bryn Mawr several times and each time I've visited there have been some memorable moments...and there have been speed bumps that keep this place from reaching its full potential.\n\nOn my latest visit this past Friday night, I made reservations for 730. My beautiful wife and I arrived right at 730. Although there were two vacant tables available, it took them at least 10 minutes or so to seat us. And when they did, they broke up a table for 6 instead of putting us at the 2 seater. Odd.\n\nBeing out and away from the kids for a few hours, we wanted at least a little bit of privacy, instead of sitting next to (pretty much connected to) a table of four. We asked the manager if we could be moved to the 2 seater...he said fine. Another 5-10 minutes (too long!) later a member of the wait staff came and, without any indication as to his intentions, whisked up our bottle of wine and silverware and ran off to the other table. Not a problem, but some eye contact and a simple 'follow me please' with even a hint of a smile would have been lovely. We shrugged and just rolled with it.\n\nThe interior is quaint, and the lighting is dim. It's a nice place for a romantic meal. But it is LOUD. So loud I would say this place is kid friendly despite being in such close quarters with your neighbors. Not sure if we'd ever try taking our four kids there (actually I'm certain we won't) but one or two can be done without much trouble.\n\nOur waitress was extremely polite and offered the energy and enthusiasm that our other friend lacked.\n\nFor dinner, we ordered a caesar salad to share and for our main courses my wife opted for her usual tagliatelli with mushroom cream sauce and i had what i always have, the tortellini pasticiatti.\n\nComplimentary with the meal were two pieces of bruschetta (very nice) and a small loaf of crusty Italian bread, which is served with butter packets (which perhaps only I find strange for an Italian restaurant?). \n\nOverall the food was delicious, except for a few somewhat minor hiccups: \n\n1. The caesar salad was served on a warm plate. The salad was excellent and would have been legendary had it been served on a chilled (or at least not warm!) plate.\n\n2. I am pretty sure they used frozen peas in the tortellini dish, which is fine with me as long as you make sure the peas are thawed before you serve it! Only a few peas were not quite thawed, but it marred what was otherwise a perfectly crafted masterpiece of a dish.\n\nWhen we paid, the manager allowed us to use an expired gift card. That was a very nice gesture and one that required no push from us to induce.\n\nAll in all, I'll keep visiting Fellini because it's relatively inexpensive and they do most everything well.", "date": "2012-07-16 17:27:36"}, {"_key": "1786879", "_id": "reviews/1786879", "_rev": "_fM0dMt6--f", "review_id": "Wb69_9E_0Mzautr5skMAUg", "user_id": "B03wL-FP3xKgZ_-pCYoHIw", "business_id": "B2wSy1zQCdZgDXOkhAKGDQ", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "We stayed for several days and pretty much liked the room.

I visited Stitch-It in June 2013\n\nIn brief: Stitch it did an EXCELLENT job on my dress and I was extremely pleased.  I needed it done in a rush and they were able to accommodate me.  Given the tight turnaround, and the work that needed to be done, I didn't mind paying a premium.  The service and results far exceeded my expectations.\n\nComplete Experience: I was attending a convention in Nashville, TN and had ordered an evening gown online a week before (admitted procrastinator tendencies).  The gown was a navy blue Tadashi Shoji evening gown with sequins and an intricately designed lace and sheer layered bodice. The gown was a tad bit too long and there was a bulge in the back. The dress arrived a few days before I was scheduled to fly out to Nashville and I knew I wouldn't have time to get it tailored before leaving.  I found a few Nashville area tailor shops on Yelp, read the reviews and decided I might try Stitch-It.  I also saw a few cleaners that advertised they performed tailoring services, but they (quite frankly) didn't give me the warm and fuzzies.  \n\nStitch-It was about a 30 minute drive from the Gaylord Hotel where I was staying, so before taking a taxi that far, I decided to check with the hotel to see if they had an in-house tailor.  When I took the dress to the Gaylord tailor/seamstress (who was the nicest lady ever), she looked at the gown and said \"I can hem the bottom....I'd have to do it by hand.  The top part though....I won't touch that with a 10ft. pole!\"  I laughed, but appreciated her honesty in not being able to handle the work that I needed done.  \n\nI contacted Stitch-It and sent pictures of the dress via text message to a nice young man who's name I can't remember (I think it was Cameron...I could be wrong).  They assured me that they should be able to accommodate me, so I hopped a cab and visited Stitch-It.  When I arrived I was greeted by courteous and professional staff.  I was shown to the dressing room and changed into my gown.  My personal tailor was Maggie O'Neill and she was AWESOME!  After the fitting and pinning, I left the gown and picked it up in two days.

We had the chicken finger sandwiches on Texas toast.  While the chicken fingers themselves were super juicy and moist, the Texas toast was too greasy to eat them on.  I love sauce and enjoyed the variety.  We tried the Zax, hot honey mustard, insane hot and ranch.  What is missing from the sauce variety, for me, is a spicy bbq and blue cheese.  Serving ranch with hot sauce is an insult to the folks in Buffalo that created the cuisine.  Aside from the bread and sauce small issues, I really enjoyed our meal.

I also don't like how I ordered extra cheese and it didn't even cover the entire pizza.  Basically they spread the sauce almost to the edge of the crust, and then the cheese is a good half inch further down from that.  It was ok, but I won't be back for pizza only.

Primarily a dessert place, Seasons also serves up some wonderful food dishes which are largely modernized updates on traditional classics. \n\nI always enjoy the shaved ice when I come here. The kind Seasons offers is a different type of dessert that I haven't seen anywhere else. The variety of boba tea that they have is also very \ngood. Among my favorite shaved ice are the hula and the koko loco. If you want half and half flavors of shaved ice in your cup there is an additional $1.50 charge for a large size. There are pre-designed concoctions or you could create your own configurations of toppings and flavors. The pre designed concoctions are a better deal.\n\nSeasons is situated on the end of a strip mall (across from a large shopping plaza with Regal Cinemas and Marshalls) with plenty of parking. The store itself is clean, bright, and modern and is kid-friendly as there are high hairs available for use. \n\nThe service has always been friendly, fast, and efficient. Seasons employs an order at the counter, take number, and food is borough out to you when ready model. \n\nI can't comment on the food exactly but my boyfriend loves the quail and our friends enjoy the chicken wings which Boon touts as \"the best food item\" there. The quail is small and very flavorful and the wings are a good size and seasoned with five spice which was enjoyed by all. \n\nI look forward to many more visits with friends at this location.

Like an all too familiar pattern, I go back to Mohammad Butt, my main man for marsala.\nBut whats this? \nThere are whispers that he no longer cooks for \"Best Taste of Asia,\" that he is gone, never to return; some sort of falling out.\n\nNo.\nNo, it can't be! \nI need to score - one .. final .. hit..\n\nLife ceases to have meaning, existential murmurings dog the mind. Who am I?\nWhy am I here?\nWhat is Cheeze Wiz?\nIts done, over, a round falls into the chamber and just as I prepare to end it all and pull the trigger- steps in ZAIKA.\n\nZaika - meaning the art of taste -  stays to to its name. This is a place where the Paneer (cheese) is made fresh in house, resulting in a cheese that's silky in texture. Especially when in contrast to the prepackaged rubbery bone-white LEGO blocks most small Indo-Pak places purchase from Indian Grocers in attempts to reduce prep-times. While at Zaika such shortcuts are not taken,  the Chef takes the extra steps needed to ensure a dish comes together as a whole. For example, the Chicken Makhani uses Smokey Tandoori Chicken, which I have never seen done before but it certainly aids the chicken to cut though the rich buttery tomato sauce and elevates the dish as a whole. Even entr\u00e9es like Dall Fray or  Palak Paneer  have so much flavor that they will leave you not missing animal protein in the least should you choose to go the vegetarian route. \n\nZaika 's appetizers, like the Veggie Samosa and Aloo Tikki, (spiced potato patties) are generally large, peppery and well spiced - the latter of which remind me of something my own mother would make. Though I must warn others to avoid the items that occasionally pop-up as specials like the potato stuffed chili peppers, unless they have a iron stomach or are a gluten for punishment. These peppers are spicy, not deveined or even seeded. Further, I find the fish pakora to be far too fishy.\n \nI've become rather taken by Zaikia. Even the simply things such as the naan are good there. Just right in elasticity, the bread does not have too much give and yet isn't too soft. It's nothing elaborate, just properly risen with a light texture and  no egg or yeast flavor. The only complaint being that it lacked that signature faint sweetness naan has. But hey, I use it mostly for mopping up the other good stuff on the plate anyway and the sweetness gets lost in the mix, so I don't mind at all.\n\nThe menu has nearly 120 different items, all numbered to order by, making take-out phone orders convenient and should eliminate any fears anyone should have of a language barrier problem. Furthermore, it has short descriptions of each dish - something all ethnic places like this should have.\nThough some items like Lassie (a frothy yogurt drink) do not appear on the menu, that too is offered - both a salty and sweet mango verities. \nThe head chef speaks English quite well and should be easy to deal with should you want to inquire more or want to setup large orders.\n\nI have already noticed parties negotiating catering for Ramadan as I anxiously awaited my own order.\n\nThe bottom line here is this, Mohammad Butt has expanded on the menu he once created for \"Best taste of Asia,\" and taken an all HALAL meat approach. \n\nOnly good things can come of this, only good things.\n\nP.S.\nZAIKA is right behind Nifty Fifties on Grant Ave., so you are all set for dessert should you want a milkshake. \nHowever, I would suggest getting the Ras Malai if available. These riccotta cheese dumplings flouting in soaked in sweetened, thickened milk are delicately flavored with cardamom, a very some amount of rose water and then garnished with pistachios.

We ordered our beverages and she brought them shortly after that. Something I did not like was there was not a drink menu on the table, but Nikki was able to tell us what beers were on draft and non-alcoholic drinks. She took our appetizer and entree order all at once. \n\nWe ordered crab stuffed mushrooms and a French onion soup to share. These items came out together. The crab stuffed mushroom was basically a giant thing of crab stuffing on a TINY mushroom, which was almost laughable, but had a good flavor nonetheless. The French onion soup had a great flavor and wasn't scalding hot, which was super nice to eat right away. \n\nAfter our appetizer came out and we finished it, our Caesar salads came out as well as a loaf of bread and some butter. This was also really great pacing of our meal! Nikki never let empty plates sit on our table, was very attentive, and always made sure we had drinks in front of us. The Caesar salads were good. I gave the bread two chances... once dipped in the French onion soup and once just with butter on it... the bread could have definitely been better - it just didn't have a good flavor to it. \n\nI ordered the 6 oz filet and he ordered the 16 oz Delmonico - both cooked medium rare. The steaks are served with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, your choice of side, and a salad or soup of the day, which isn't mentioned anywhere on the menu. I got broccoli as my side and my boyfriend got a sweet potato with all the fixings. I saw three tables sat after us receive their entrees before us - I don't know if it was a kitchen issue or something else, but we were sat at least five minutes before each of those tables - I tried to make sense of the delay, but it honestly wasn't a big deal to me. Our steaks came out on hot metal plates that were inserted into a cooler outer shell. My filet was nice and thick and cooked perfectly and the broccoli was steamed very tenderly, but there were not enough saut\u00e9ed mushrooms on the plate, in my opinion. If I had known it would have been like five mushrooms with the steak, I totally would have gotten them as a side. My boyfriend's steak was cooked perfectly as well, but being on the hot metal dish led the steak to cook more at the table, which he wasn't particularly pleased with. He enjoyed his sweet potato with butter, but it didn't come out with cinnamon on it like he requested. \n\nAnyway, I am sure we will return! Our server, Nikki, was fabulous.

We arrive at the Sake House at 4pm. There is only one other table and they were closing out. We sit down, and I immediately ask for a simple ice water with lemon. Waiter comes back 20 minutes later (no water). I order a simple roll for my son, to get him started  and a cold Sake. I said I will wait to order mine to get him settled. Another 30 min later, still no water, no food. Waiter comes back with hot Sake, instead of cold. 20 minutes later, the roll for my son (not how I asked) finally some cold Sake, then I have to request water, and then only one cup for my son, no lemon. When I see 2 going on a third table had come in and ordered, and a \"to go\" order is being placed, all with food and water, I became perturbed. The waiter never came back to see what I wanted. Never came back to check on the order. Finally after  nearly 2 hours of waiting and trying to deal with my antsy son, who waited so long to be served, and seeing one chef trying to make everyone's order I decided it was time to go. Finally after waiting another 5/10 minutes I had to walk up and ask for my check , which was only a $6 drink. Which I reluctantly paid. After being in the hospitality industry for years, I know what to expect, and I know what to forgive. I also know that English being a second language must be tough...BUT since he was able to wait in other tables i know that wasn't the issue. After 2 hours of waiting, and dealing with a fussy/hungry toddler as a single mother I feel like the least they could have done is offer a free drink, to say \"we understand we couldn't accommodate you, but we tried.\" It's principal above all else. ...I just waisted 2 hours! And had to leave and take my baby somewhere else. Time is money! And I waisted 2 hours here! \nTime that is rare and I had to plan being a busy mother.\nI should have listened to the other reviews about the shitty service here. \nDon't waste your time or money!!!\nStay away!

I don't need to mention that other 4 companies sent their quotes in less than 48 hours. Since no one replied til today, I called the direct phone and I left the message on the answering machine.

It tasted heavily of sherry, but had almost nothing else going for it besides a heap full of really amazing wild mushrooms (which was redeeming). The fries are shoestring and thin, and really tasty when they're piping hot, but stale quickly and then get kind of hard and yucky. My friend had the shrimp and grits, which was good, but overly rich even for a typically overly rich dish. We had a beyond amazing meal the next day at Commander's for the same price.
