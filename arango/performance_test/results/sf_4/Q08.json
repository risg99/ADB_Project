I DO NOT eat partially cooked shellfish.  Another server came and stated they can throw it back on the grill.  That violates Health laws.  I said, \"no thanks,\" and she brought me back another salad without the shrimp because I said hold the shrimp.  What upset me was, the original server came back and with an attitude.  He stated, \"buy the way, we took the shrimp and looked at it under a bright light and it WAS fully cooked.\"  We discounted the shrimp.  I said, \"It was not about $$.  Really?

We wandered around downtown looking for a place to eat and found The Stillery Midtown. Gary was our waiter and we found out is was their soft opening that night! We decided to try a few our their signature \"moonshine\" cocktails which we have never had before. Gary was very helpful helping us decide which ones to try as I can be very picky with my cocktails. I had the Blackberry Lime Moonshine and my husband had a Blueberry Smash. OMG SOOOOO good! We ordered the Sriracha Devil Eggs as a starter and although I am not a fan of spicy these were dynamite!  Gary had asked the chef to go light on the spice for me, which they did, but they still had a bite to them which was enjoyable and the prosciutto was thin and crispy. For our main course we had another round of moonshine cocktails. I stuck with the Blackberry Lime and my husband had the Dreamsicle (which taste just like a orange creamsicle). We split the MC Burger which was one of the best burgers we have ever had! It came with a side of shoestring fries that were super yummy as well! The burger had 2 patties, prosciutto and a fried egg on it. It was cooked to perfection and just oozed with yumminess. In addition was asked for a side of the mac and cheese. I can't decide what I liked more, the burger or the mac and cheese! The mac and cheese also was one of the best I've ever had, we finished everything! We are not big eaters and usually leave half our food on our plates or take it home but OMG not this time! We inhaled it all! Gary was great, great sense of humor, checked on us frequently but not annoyingly like some do, even took our picture when we asked him to. Billy, the general manager stopped by to introduce himself and check on us. He gave us some information on what to do during our stay and was very helpful as well. We were very appreciative of the genuine care we were shown this night and to boot dinner was free! We left Gary a nice tip since dinner was comped due to the soft opening but really we would have tipped him heavily anyways cuz he deserved it! Good job guys! We will be back on our next trip to Nashville and we already sent people your way!

Pluses include an access code that allows entrance at your convenience - but we had to call several times as we never did receive the email that was meant to convey the code as well as various other instructions for parking, etc. We stayed in Room #2, the largest and most expensive of the 6.  It was clean and attractive, but chairs were tiny and uncomfortable and mattress was soft and lumpy - not making for restful lounging or sleep.  While WIFI is touted, there was no code in the room for access, and we couldn't locate anyone to inquire.  We were caught off guard that no breakfast is provided on site, as that is part of the enjoyment of staying at a B & B rather than a hotel, for us.  The one option available that morning (Louie's doesn't open until later) was Henry's, which was not a good experience.  Parking is almost two blocks away, which is very inconvenient and not made obvious on the web site.  The indication that street parking is plentiful is very misleading, as this is a very populated and busy business district with limited parking.  We never encountered a proprietor or staff person, even when searching to ask questions.  This is certainly a serviceable option for a place to stay, but not superior to a hotel experience, in my opinion.\n\nNote added after Leesa's response:  I appreciate your quick attention to the review and your detailed response.

I worked in the restaurant business for 20 years so I am very forgiving with people being busy, I have been there, but this was bad. I hope that management reads the reviews because I want to help. 1. Have designated rolls for people, the bartender is the only one behind the bar and stays there. There should be a waitress (or two) that doesn't get any of their own drinks, including sodas. The waitress needs to wait on the tables. 2. The manager should not take over for the staff, rather make sure the food gets out, bartender has ice, customers have silverware, anything to make the experience better. Set the staff up for success. There was too much confusion when the tables were shared and maybe that is why there were so many food mistakes. 3. Your kitchen could not handle the food orders, or your wait staff could not handle putting in the orders. On game day you need to only make 4 different pizzas, order by the pie or sell pizza by the slice. Make a menu just for that, limit the food choices and maybe put a few drinks that are easy to make or bottle beer to sell more and expedite the order. Trust me people will be happy just to have a drink and a bite to eat even if they wanted a sandwich instead and to have a drink fast. 4. Explain to the bartender how the metered pour works, that was just painful. I have more things to fix but that would mean that I should be paid a managers salary. To sum up our stay, one table left because they had been here for hourS, yes plural, and their food was never cooked. Some of our food came out, some did not. Other people ordered food and It took forever. The manager was rude to his bartender and was arguing with her for half the time we were there.

From the delicious food to the deep rich colors of the walls with matching decor, everything about the night was perfect. \n\nHaving lived in the NYC area for the past 10 years, we didn't think we could be impressed with a venue back home in Idaho. However, the Chateau far exceeded our expectations and is the BEST place in the state for an event. The place honestly looks like a European mansion. From the marble floors to the matching artwork to the doors and lighting, the place will make you feel like you are transported to Paris for the night. The Chateau gave us beautiful pictures and memories for our special occasion.\n\nAside from the venue space, we also came back on a separate night to the restaurant and ordered numerous items with truffle on the menu. The quality of the food,  the fresh ingredients and the ambience of the place were all impeccable. The brie dish was also AMAZING and something I crave all the time. \n\nThank you to everyone at the Chateau for making our engagement party a memorable night that we will cherish forever.

The first time was when they had the food trucks. I must say that's the best night to go there. We tried something off of each truck, and it was amazing. I believe they call it Brews n Bites.\n\nThe second time was yesterday. Both times it was busy and the server was with us in about ten minutes. Both times they were courteous and earned respectable tips. The food served by the actual Sail wasn't the best to be honest. The Cuban Nachos we got were lukewarm, soggy and the chips were very generic. The Cuban Sandwich I got and the burger my girlfriend got were OK, but I've had better. Where The Sail really shines is their drink menu. My girlfriend had a drink called The Sail Phone. I can't remember what I had but it was amazing too. Lastly, the view is amazing. It was basically the best view I'd ever had of the water around Tampa.\n\nMy final rating is a 4/5. The only drawback is the actual food The Sail serves.

We ordered online (through Yelp) and for $27 we were well on our way to receiving Pho Tai, Kung Pao Chicken, and Pho Dec Biet (I'm butchering this). They do not deliver to my area, even though it's Brandon, but we saved on the $3 delivery fee and got some fresh air! Walked in about half an hour after ordering and the woman was very confused and said they did not have any outstanding takeout orders. After a few minutes, we were able to clear this up that we had ordered online. About 10 minutes later, we were on our way with a ton of hot spicy food! I like that you can order the Kung Pao to your spiciness specifications - we went with Medium just to try it out. The to go Pho was packaged in three separate containers. One for the broth, one for the meat/noodles/onions, and one for the bean shoots and other fixings. The Kung Pao was a rather large portion that also came with white rice. For $27 we have several meal's worth of food, which is great. With so many great options in our area, we really need to get out and explore more and I'm very glad that Lee House made the cut!

This simply wouldn't have worked in another part of town. \n\nFirst of all the items sold (except for some local restaurants selling food items) are from Germany. Even the lebkuchen I purchased was imported. This also means that purchased goods will set you back a pretty penny. My mom had her eye on lace Christmas ornaments (she lived in Germany for years) but decided to restrain because compared to buying it in Germany was vastly more expensive! \n\nThe decor on the vendor stalls and even the shed housing the zamboni where perfectly 'winter alpine chic'. Lots of picture options!\n\nI will have to agree with other reviewers that there wasn't a wide variety of things to purchase, nor at a wide price point variety. BUT.... America is the land of variety and other countries simply aren't. You get a few options and that's it. And when it comes to a German Christmas... well, it's tradition all the way and that holds down variety. Sorry, America. You are lucky some of the lebkuchen was decorated in English.\n\nThis next paragraph is intended to be a total b!t$h fest about the wait times for everything from skating to local chocolates, but I have a bigger complaint for the next paragraph.\n\nWHILE THIS LOOKS LIKE AN ADVENT FESTIVAL, IT SIMPLY ISN'T.

A LOT of good things, and one major fault, which was quality of food related.\nLet's start with the positives. Service was very professional, attentive and quick (possibly too quick, as I feel a fine dining establishment should be a bit slower overall, compared to a regular restaurant). We had a special occasion, and everyone, from the hostess, to the server, to the manager acknowledged it- which was very nice. The mixed drinks were very nice. The biscuits with honey butter were excellent. The scallops were good, not great, and the mac and cheese was very nice. The wedge salad, was actually very impressive, with a very rich, and flavorful russian dressing. The key lime pie was also very good, with strong flavor and a beautiful message written, for our special occasion. We also liked the ambience and decor. Beautiful old building, nice decorations, music was good, and we sat in a nice booth. \nNow for the bad. At a steak house, you'd think the steak would be a highlight, but it unfortunately it wasn't. It was decent at best, but not great, as one would expect. I'm not a big steak guy, but I've had better filets at both Capital Grille, as well as Flemings, which I was not expecting. Mine was cooked very well, with a beautiful char crisp exterior. But the quality of the meat wasn't up to par, in my opinion. The meat did that weird thing where when you cut it, it sort of flattens and separates a bit, with it still being sorta still together. I have no idea what it is called, but it wasn't good. The better filets that I've had in the past cut like butter, and the meat stayed nice and firm, and together, as you cut it.  The flavor of the meat was nice, but my prior experiences with nice filets, have been better. \nIt's a shame, as pretty much everything else was very nice, and the service was excellent. It feels very nice as a customer, for all the staff members to acknowledge a big event in one's life, so that was nice. My partner was also very impressed, and happy, which was nice.

Evidently my experience with them is not unique...  I had a phone and internet service plan with them for several years, and they were continually adding absurd \"special fee\" charges out of the blue.  I would call them up, and they would eventually agree to remove the charge, but then the same charge would pop up again on the next month's bill.  The vast majority of these charges were for amounts under $20, but it's the principle of the thing.  Also, my sense of all of this is that they figured people would get tired of spending an hour on the phone each month trying to recover $10-$20 and so would eventually give up and let them pocket the money, which amounts to quite a lot when you consider the number of Comcast customers out there. \n\nTo make things worse, at a certain point, my phone started developing really bad static and would continually drop calls.  I was never able to talk for more than about ten minutes without the call abruptly cutting off, which basically meant that I could not use the phone to make any business calls.  This went on for nearly six months.  I'd call up Comcast technical support every week or two - sometime several times a week - to try to resolve the problem, but they clearly had no clue what to do.  They also sent technicians out to my home three separate times.  Each time I received a bill for over $100, and two of the technicians actually made the situation worse; the third did nothing.

A real thin crust pizza shouldn't be this doughy. I would have expected better from a Chicagoland small pizza chain. \n3) Sauce. There was barely any on the pizza.

The only stipulation when choosing this option is that your entire table must be on board. You choose two beginnings per table, one tandoori small plate per table, two entrees per table, and the dessert tasting (which includes three items). We opted to let the chef recommend our selections while we sat back and anticipated the culinary fun to come.\n\nThe amount of food we received was incredible. We were stuffed after the appetizers! The Stuffed Long Hot Peppers and the Crispy Cauliflower were a hit at our table. The Tandoori Mixed Grill was equally as tasty, and the Chicken Tikka Masala was excellent. There is nothing worse than dry chicken, and this dish was moist and flavorful. Everything we tried was well-balanced and satisfying. The Naan, Lasooni, Provencal, and Garhwali were out of this world and I could have eaten the entire damn basket myself.

It's very thorough with an added hot stone massage and heel treatment included in the $30 price. However, the gel manicures are fairly sub-par and quite hit or miss depending on who you see. After 6 months of visiting this salon regularly, I can recall very few occasions that my gel manicure lasted well. From chipping polish to broken nails to color fading, some of the work hasn't been great. Overall, I'm not inclined to pay $35 regularly for a simple gel manicure that lasts 1.5 weeks max. Also, as a few others noted, there seems to be some  inconsistencies/ unclarity with pricing and specials. Should you visit, definitely check out the discounts and pricing they advertise on their website and cite those once you arrive for your service. I recall just a few occasions where I had to correct the service receipt, including $5 fees for removing gel in order to give me a new gel manicure. Not only did the manicurist fail to mention a word about this during the service, but we all know that you can purchase a bottle of acetone for less than $1.... Why would I pay $5 to remove some nail polish when I'm already paying a premium price for a full gel manicure (and ironically, if you continue to get gel manicures there, they don't charge you for gel removal)? Overall, it's a clean and nice spot with great pedicures, but I would be wary of paying extra for gel manicures that aren't guaranteed to last.\n\n**Update**\nA couple of weeks ago, I visited the salon for one of their awesome pedicures and decided to give the gel manicure another try. Even after going to one of the more experienced manicurists, my gel manicure only lasted 1 week before it began peeling and chipping. Recently, I decided to visit another nail salon literally 3 minutes away & got a gel manicure for $25 ($10 less than RHNIII) that looks great and lasts. Sure the new spot isn't as fancy (and appears to be much more busy/crowded), but I can go without the image of luxury for more affordable manicures that actually last.", "date": "2017-12-09 02:23:53"}, {"_key": "1028855", "_id": "reviews/1028855", "_rev": "_fNyrzFK--_", "review_id": "iaytE_H2FSiSXdW26R57KQ", "user_id": "TbeWHsWcP2X-DZ0nOPsDVA", "business_id": "YSgcojsb2kWHXNLWaGCuBA", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "My boyfriend and I left for a frigid midday shopping excursion and wanted to grab a bite. I was seeking something kinda classy but still quick, and found myself craving pasta [which I totally don't do every other day of my life]. This place absolutely KILLED IT. First of all, the bread was so fresh I was honestly amazed. Have you ever made bread at home and eaten it fresh out of the oven? Yeah, it was like that. The olive oil and cheese (I think Parmigiano reggiano) they keep at the table was the highest quality I've ever had at an Italian restaurant in the U.S. Next came our salads which had arugula, endives, pistachios, and a white wine vinaigrette. It was genuinely one of the best salads I've ever had at any restaurants, particularly because the ingredients were as fresh as they could possibly be. Next came our appetizer, an apple butter bruschetta with microgreens on the aforementioned bread-of-the-gods. Something--possibly the bread--had a deep, smoky flavor that meshed perfectly with the sweet apple butter and crisp greens. Once again, this dish blew me away. Finally, we shared the garganelli which had an aromatic herb sauce with braised beef and green olives. It was totally unlike any pasta dish I've ever had before, and I loved it. Notably, the pasta was so good I told Derek it had to be fresh as rehydrated or thawed pasta cannot possibly have that good of a texture. Turns out...it was! They make all their pasta in house. We also shared the house red wine with our meal which was a great deal at $16 for 500mL, or three glasses. It was very earthy and went great with the tart but savory pasta. To finish things off, we each had a little gelato which was also probably the best I've had in the U.S. All in all, I was completely blown away by Pastaria. I went in expecting nothing more than a casual pasta place, but it was truly great food by Italian restaurant standards or any other for that matter.

Well, in my family we do distribute leftovers but we traditionally will go Black Friday shopping and stay at a hotel in downtown Indianapolis and eat out for dinner. This past Black Friday we visited a sweet little join just south of the Circle City Mall called Nada and after scrolling through the menu decided I must try this: Crispy Pork Belly Tacos.\n\nThis dish has a lot going on and if you've ever been to Nada before you know that everything is pretty much al a carte style so the sides were all bought individually but an order of tacos does come with three tacos so that's cool. If you wanted to get some friends together and share some tacos that's a genius idea and I definitely recommend it as they have a wide array of tacos and other sides from the menu here:\n\nBack to the critique of my meal, let me quickly write about the side dishes. The chili-glazed crispy potatoes were my favorite. The sweet chili sauce reminds me of the sauce my mom uses on her egg rolls (or lumpia to stick to my Filipino roots) and it's sweet and spicy and crispy but a dabble of crema does good for those who don't like \"spicy\" things. The beans and rice and the cucumber salad were good, but nothing jumped out from the flavors standpoint but they were very complimentary to the dish.\n\nThe crispy pork belly tacos themselves were salivatingly tasty! If you've never had pork belly or not sure what it is...in short, pork belly is the part of the pig where we get BACON. Pork belly is ideally cooked two ways...smoked in a BBQ pit or simply deep-fried to be crispy and tender. When this plate came out the fried pork belly strips jump out and the pickled peppers and onions are a nice contrasting color. The rectangular plate is a nice touch and does make handling the plate itself easy as sometimes the plates even for tacos can be scolding hot at other restaurants. The dishes the sides come in are pretty sleek...very shallow, but of good size and easy handling.\n\nThe pork belly was definitely crispy which is how I like my bacon and so that's how I like my pork belly. Not really any smoke flavor which is always complimentary to pork belly but that's OK as crispy is still really good and Nada does it PERFECTLY! There's a crispy crunchy first bite with a good healthy amount of \"chew\" to the pork belly. As your tastebuds navigate through the pork belly they encounter a sweet and tangy flavor from the pickled peppers and onions, and then a little bit of a hit and from the guajillo peppers and cilantro for an amazing bite each and every time. I like the flour tortillas because of a smoother texture, but if you don't like flour tortillas they do offer their tacos in corn tortillas, but I think it'd be too much of a gritty type of texture as the crispy pork belly has that to it. \n\nThe downside to this dish and specifically to the crispy pork belly tacos, besides there only being three of them, is I wasn't too particularly fond of the size of the tortilla's. I get that they're \"taco\" sized tortillas, but I think they could be a little bit larger. Tacos are meant to fit in your hand and these definitely do, but they do way too easily in my opinion. I think if they were to increase the tortillas it'd be a nice touch and probably get people fuller faster!\n\nSUMMARY\n\nAt the end of the day...the crispy pork belly tacos at Nada are full of intense and complimentary flavors. If you've never experienced pork belly in this form (bacon is definitely good, but pork belly is like 1/2\u2033 thick cut bacon strips) this would be a great gateway to eating pork belly and enjoying the glorious flavor that cut of meat is.", "date": "2017-12-05 18:12:47"}, {"_key": "1030641", "_id": "reviews/1030641", "_rev": "_fNyrzJO--Z", "review_id": "xEWBvcvaecF8dZpVr9adhQ", "user_id": "InbTfr3CWvtk-ufCX4nHgQ", "business_id": "M_JpBboLPj4kWFchdnjlAA", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This place has a great environment with delicious food.

Overall, I fall into the camp of IndeBlue's competitor, but I think IndeBlue does a few things very well - \n\nIndeBlue pushes the boundaries on the menu in going for Indian fusion and incorporating less traditional flavors, especially in their appetizers. You get really interesting and flavorful dishes that are great for someone looking for less traditional Indian food. The same applies to desserts, where IndeBlue has a couple inventive and really tasty options. I love the spinach chaat, liked tandoori wings, but didn't love the shrimp roti tacos. \n\nUnfortunately, there's a big mismatch with the entrees. Their main course menu is what you expect from most Indian restaurants - some of the classic North indian dishes, with many popular South Indian dishes as well. By comparison to the appetizers that you've just had, the more \"traditional\" dishes fall flat, but on their own, they also don't compare well to other upscale Indian restaurants. If you are someone who always orders the tikka masala / makhani, then I think it's not the best restaurant for you.

It was sliced into 8 equally sized pieces which were able to be eatten with chop sticks without falling apart. All for $14 which I would say was a fair price considering its a waterfront dining local.\nThis location has 3 larger separate rooms away from the dining room offering different genres of dance music. In addition to outside dining option, unfortunately not available for us that evening as it was reserved for private holiday party.\nAll is all a very nice location, dress it up, dress it causally nice and its a good time had by all.

It's not what you expect from the outside at all - the menu is actually upscale (as are the beer selections). Wouldn't hurt if they could update the building exterior. Maybe add a nicer-looking sign from the highway. Little things.\n\nThe food, a strong 4.5 stars. My friends had good reports back about crab chowder and the crab enchilada special. While in the middle of my two delicious beers I lit into the special burger of the day, which came with bacon, Gorgonzola, mushroom gravy, and something else I forget. I asked rare, it came out nice and just on the medium rare side of rare, which is really what I wanted. Heck, Courtney (our waitress) asked if I wanted it Pittsburgh rare (similar to \"blue\"), and so I bet they will do whatever you ask.\n\nSide note: Courtney was awesome. She was a great sport and took everything in stride. She made me feel like the only patron even as she waited on my other 10 friends and other tables. I did have to ask for her once or twice but heck, that's life in a popular establishment. She got all of our orders right, only forgetting one beer on the evening (but not charging for it, and it wasn't mine so who cares!). Kudos to Courtney. If you know her, remind her about The Fest in Gainesville.\n\nAnyway, if I can point to one main culprit for the slide to four stars, it's dessert. I had my heart set on the caramel cake, but apparently it was discontinued (Courtney mentioned that they should remove it from the menu, so it seemed like more than just being out). I tried the chocolate stout ice cream and it was unfortunately sitting in a sea of liquid. The texture of the remaining ice cream was rather icy. The other ice cream ordered did not appear to have these problems, so I'm inclined to blame it on the alcohol from the beer, but TSP may want to check their freezer temperature just in case.

I hired this company on 12/14/2017 to fix a broken kitchen drain line located beneath the slab.  Derek assured me that he would be able to fix it.\n\n12:14/17:  He cuts through my beautiful hardwood floors and began drilling several holes into my foundation.  About half way through, he decided that he couldn't do it and abandoned the job, leaving holes in my floor.  He never refilled the holes in the foundation as stated on the estimate.  After this failure, he recommended a sink pump.  \n\n12/15/17:  Derek Simons installs a sink pump under my kitchen sink.  One major problem is he completely destroyed my venting system in my attic in the process! He cut the vent pipe that extends from the roof and capped the end. The other piece of my vent pipe was then used to reroute the kitchen line to my master bath.  Fun fact:  this type of \"repair\" is unheard of!  Another fun fact: the vent pipe extending from the roof is filling with rain water because, well, it has NO WHERE TO GO due to him capping the end.  The weight of the water will eventually cause the pipe to crash through my ceiling because he didn't have the decency to secure it. \n\nOh, but that's not the end.  \n\nHe removed a drain pipe in my kitchen, but failed to replace it.  Guess what happened next?  Major flooding!  Did he bother to fix the flooding?  No he did not.  In fact, I mentioned it before he left and he said, \"monitor it and call me if it gets worse...It might be your water line\".  My water line isn't leaking.  It's the gaping hole you left in my floor!  Everything was worse the following day (12/16/2017), so I texted him the picture and followed up with phone call.  He actually answered that time and told me, \"I'm going to my wife's baby shower. I'll check it out tomorrow.\"  Sunday comes and he never calls nor did he show up.  I texted him more pictures because it's getting worse. He never responded.  I finally call a different plumber on Monday, 12/18/2017. \n\nThe new plumber who saw the contraption in my attic and mess under my sink was flabbergasted!  He said he's never seen such terrible work in his 30 years of being a plumber.  \n\nI regret hiring this company so much!!!  He never actually fixed what I hired him for, destroyed my property, and made everything much worse.  He just took my money and scurried off.  He refuses to return my money and honor the warranty. I not only have to spend more money to fix the original problem, but now have the added cost of repairing the damage he caused.  He kept saying he was helping me, but all he did was make everything worse. Unbelievable!

We loved the funky boho-type decor and the hotel felt very clean and nicely updated. It's just around the corner from State Street, so you're able to get out and walk around downtown, but there's not the feel of being SMACK in the middle of downtown. It's a nice escape. \n\nThe complimentary wine at check-in (for my husband, none for me for another few weeks) was a nice surprise as was the complimentary happy hour every day in the lobby with free wine and appetizers. They also had a spread of coffee, tea, and biscotti each morning and different flavored fruit water each afternoon. Also, tiny thing, but the valet opens the door for you every time you enter/exit! Nice touch! The restaurant in the hotel is called Finch and Fork and we LOVED our waiter...dang it! I can't remember his name, but he was so witty and entertaining that we came back to the restaurant again the next night and requested to be sat in his section. He was so sweet to give us a complimentary toasted milkshake to celebrate our baby...you MUST have this when you're there. It's amazing!\n\nWe probably enjoyed the rooftop most of all! It was very relaxing, had great views of Santa Barbara, several areas to sit and relax, heating lamps, and a nice fireplace. This is the only dog-free zone in the hotel, so it was a nice getaway to just relax at any time of day.\n\nThe only bummer about our stay was that in the room next to ours, there was a very YAPPY little dog who was left in the room all afternoon and barked for three straight hours (probably more, but we had left for dinner by then). It kind of killed the relaxing vibe we had going! But, we notified the hotel during our checkout, and they took $150 off our bill for the inconvenience! So nice and not at all what we were expecting since it wasn't the hotel's fault of course! We just notified them of the issue so they knew some people abandon their dogs in their rooms for extended periods of time. Why even bring your dog with you? Whatever.\n\nThank you so much for a great stay! We'd love to return someday!", "date": "2017-12-05 04:50:38"}, {"_key": "1048641", "_id": "reviews/1048641", "_rev": "_fNyrzvG--a", "review_id": "H9C6ON4qooAe0FkxRtgqKw", "user_id": "QpLQzRIvNFM9QjqEUdUR5g", "business_id": "jderomgrDeeR5A4TqRaHvg", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Great furniture, service & value!

I don't usually like pork roll but the fries they made were delicious, salty and crunchy.\n\nFor our main course we both ordered short rib specials. I had the Benedict and my husband had the tostada. They were very different dishes and both were fantastic. The Benedict was served on a piece of Texas toast which was able the support the heaviness of the short ribs and eggs, yet still taste crunchy. I loved the whole combination and it was really nice comfort food for a winter day. The tostada was also very good but a little lighter with a smaller amount of short rib and a nice salsa on top.

Thanks to Yelp's fabulous Eat24, I discovered Outlaw Pizza. \n\nMy experience is based on delivery only, but I've sampled my way through the menu and had a variety of customer service experiences. \n\nLet's start with the main hurdle: how is the customer service if you've never actually been to the joint? Well, friends, the customer service is great. Just tonight, I ordered an appetizer they'd sold out of. I got a super prompt, super polite phone call from someone at the shop asking if I'd like to sub in one of the other items from their menu that was the same price. Sure! Let's do it! The suggestion wasn't pushy, either. I could tell that they wanted to make me happy as a customer. I would love to try my original selection (stuffed mushrooms) when they are back on the menu since they seem to be a fan favorite. \n\nHow's the bike delivery, you ask? It's great! Their bikers vary, but all of them are fast and kind. I make a point to tip them really well because I appreciate that they are out there on bikes, often braving weather I don't want to brave. This may result in my food getting a priority in delivery rotations because my orders always come before they are expected. Love it. (Pro-tip: if you use Eat24, you can tip before your order even arrives which will result in prompt attention if you are a tidy tipper.) The single hitch with delivery is that you can't order a pizza for delivery...but you can order a calzone with the same toppings! Probably better! \n\nBut suz, I'm just here for the food. Well, cool, me, too. And it's good. There are some parts of the menu I don't understand yet (Pizza beignets? Nah. I ordered them tonight, and I did not get it.), but there are other parts that are firing on all cylinders like the speciality combos and the mozzarella logs. Those pizza/calzone options are both named thematically and really great. I order the Unforgiven (artichokes, mushrooms, kalamata olives, red sauce, cheese) as often as I can, and my co-workers steal it from me just as often. This is a damn fine calzone. The crust is also different from most of the crusts in NOLA, and I appreciate that quite a lot. \n\nHaving cooked at a lot of spots, I do recognize that the team at Outlaw is pushing to get the food out without the perfection of a fine dining spot. Things will come out a little more or less done or a little burnt on the edge or whatever. It's not supposed to be Antoine's, though. This is a neighborhood joint, not that stuffy place your grandma took you when she turned 80. We have to acknowledge the difference and feel a little weird about it all at once. But eh. We've all been that cook that is trying to do a great, from-scratch menu at a joint that is casual enough to not fully care. \n\nI really appreciate that Outlaw is doing something a little different here in the NOLA pizza scene. They haven't knocked my #1 pizza joint (Magazine Pizza) off the top spot, but I've been calling Outlaw more and more lately. Perhaps it's possible to love two things equally, hrm? \n\nAccessibility notes: online ordering available.", "date": "2017-12-07 08:26:46"}, {"_key": "1053111", "_id": "reviews/1053111", "_rev": "_fNyrz4---T", "review_id": "5qlMViagGqDEwg-5p2gywA", "user_id": "XHB1iopv7Pk2ZjLnbEIykA", "business_id": "cVV8GWVIe9BwyCOKwrFgPA", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "A great little neighborhood market with great sandwiches.

For brunch I went with the French toast and a side of bacon.

PROS: fast service, they honored my reservation time, the staff was super friendly, the restaurant/bathrooms were clean, portion sizes were perfect, and the prices were on par for the location.

The Tucson Botanical Gardens Luminaria!  Very tastefully done, festive, beautiful, everything Christmas!\nThe problem?  The people!  Too many people of all ages, in a small venue trying to walk, talk, eat, drink, take pictures, push baby carriages, wheelchairs and walkers; children running amok, parents, also running amok chasing the children!  ALL IN THE DARK!  Know it all's, know nothings, people with no sense of direction nor respect for the space of others, less alone respect of the botanical gardens, leaving litter behind for the others to clean up.  Inept Police Officers, standing in the road without their covers or the use of flashlights, trying to direct traffic.  God damn, Officer, use a 30 minute road flare if you are too cheap to buy a flashlight! (I'm a retired copper so I know of what I speak).\nI have to say it was very organized inside, but getting IN was a disaster.  There is an entry \"arch\" and a line of people.  We see the Musician check in and the Volunteer check in, but where is the pre-paid/will call area?  OH, the signs are on the pre-paid/will call table?  Can't see that from the parking lot, folks.  And although well meaning, the Volunteers in the parking lot were useless.\nI understand trying to run an event on a limited budget.  BUT, there HAS to be large, colorful signage to direct people, not small 8  1/2 x 11 copies!  People are akin to cattle; they have to be directed and prodded to move.  Filtering out the pre-paid/will calls out from walk-ins, then morphing them back into the walk in line, telling them to \"wave your program\" on the way in is a recipe for fraud!  IF I was the type of guy who wanted to defraud the Gardens, I could've picked up as many programs as I could (the number of programs that were discarded and floating around the inside area was unbelievable), walk outside and give away the programs to the \"walk in's!!!!\"   $$$ down the drain.  Something to think about next year.\nThis was our 2nd year in attendance.  We brought an In-Law from Back East and travelled an hour and a half to attend.  She loved it.

It was certainly worth more than that. We started with chicken liver pate served in a china cup with toasted rye bread. Two orders were shared by the table. The chicken livers were done to a fine paste but still gave us that slightly minerally taste that is chicken liver. I could have eaten two myself.

Almost falling off the bone and cooked so well that the fatty flavor of lamb was there but in a very worderful level that to was hard to stop eating the extremely generous portion.  There was skate on a bed of pulled short ribs. Again the fatty taste of short ribs was mellowed so that it didn't overpower the delicasy of the skate. Last lastly there was a rib eye steak aged 55 days. Done to a delicious medium rare that was cut with a table knife with oven roasted potatoes.

I grab a cab from the airport and say I want to go to my hotel. To which the cab driver replies, \"do you realize we wait three to four hours for a fare and you only want to go xx miles?\" So after some back and forth I say he can take me to one of the best restaurants in St. Louis if that's more to his liking. I imagine he took me here because 1. It is a fantastic restaurant and 2. The cab fare was close to $60.\nAs for the restaurant; it really is phenomenal Italian cuisine. The restaurant is in an adorable Italian area (think Boston's North End but smaller). The restaurant is very old school Italian feeling and I loved the dark, plush decor, and the Christmas decorations did much to bolster my black mood. \nThe service was excellent. I had a drink at the bar while I waited for a table. I was afraid I'd be waiting a long time on a Friday night, but I only waited as long as a glass of wine took to drink (not long).\nI usually pass on bread but I almost ate the entire basket. It was so fresh and so delicious; don't skip out on the bread here. They had French Onion soup as a special tonight and it was probably the best French onion soup I've ever eaten. For dinner I had chicken lemonota and it was one of the best lemon chicken dishes I've ever had. I ordered a side of pasta since all pasta is made in house. The pasta itself was good but I regretted getting the garlic and olive oil sauce. It was so crazy spicy I started sweating and I live in the south where we pour hot sauce on damn near everything. If I could go back in time, I'd caution myself and insist I order Alfredo or red sauce. So maybe also heed this warning when you go. Unless you enjoy having your taste buds burned off your tongue. \nI ordered cannoli for dessert which was definitely fresh and pretty tasty if not the best I've ever had it was still good!\nI would highly recommend this restaurant. It really was one of the best dining experiences I've had in this city and the food is just absolutely delicious. The price is also fair.

Here is what happened:\n\nAs I am waiting for my drink at Starbuck's on this cold Winter's night, in walks an old man who needs to use the restroom. I sense his need was urgent. And being that it was late virtually all of the downtown establishments were closed. So the counter gal tells this kindly looking old man that if he buys something that she can give him the key to the restroom.\n\nI am aghast and speechless at this incredulous lack of humanity (obviously a store policy that the gal felt compelled to enforce). The man quickly says that his companion will buy something. His companion, a young man, possibly his grandson, begins thumbing through his wallet for money. Just then the counter gal tells me that my credit card did not go through. I come around the counter again to pay and I see the young man looking through his wallet still. I thought he did not have money so I told the gal that they are with me and to let the man use the bathroom.\nThen the young man says, \"No, it is ok. I would like to pay for your order.\" He hands me a gift card. My order was $10.10! He goes on to say, \"it's worth it as long as he gets to use the bathroom.\" I was incredibly touched by this young man's compassion, so concerned for his companion that he would pay without hesitation $10 to Starbucks so that old man could use the facility. Then he wished me a Merry Christmas. This young man blessed two people that night with his compassion: His grandfather and me. \n\nAs for Starbucks, you need to change your store policy.

Bar has a decent-ish selection of Mexican beers and drinks; had margarita, which was pretty good. I'd probably just have them make a Michelada next time I'd go.\n\nAs others have mentioned, the service is pretty solid by general Philadelphia restaurant standards. Our water knew the menu well and was able to discuss some of the options on the menu.\n\nIn terms of food, it was a mixed bag, but on the balance, positive. Shrimp cocktail is too die for and probably the best I've had anywhere, for any kind of restaurant. For the entree, I had the camarones al ajillo, which was decent, but the format of the dish was a bit offputting. It tasted quite different from versions of this dish I have had elsewhere. FInally, the blue corn tacos al pastor were good, although my partner found the tacos to be a bit dry. Tacos were good, but not exceptional in my opinion.\n\nConclusion: I think it's a good place to take someone who may not be that adventurous in terms of Mexican cuisine; the service is strong, the drinks from the bar are solid.

Meadowood Mall has added a handful of indies to its selection of snack purveyors, including sandwich and salad offerings from Nana and Pop's Eatery. \n\nThere's a selection of salads and kid bites, but it was the menu's curious note, \"all sandwiches come with cream cheese,\" that caught our attention. Apparently, the word \"all\" was being used in a less than global sense; mayo and mustard are available on request.\n\nSandwiches are served with a dill pickle spear and choice of mustard potato or pesto macaroni salads, bagged chips, or an upgrade to steak fries for an additional $1.50. The side salads were pretty good, with the potato my favorite. Quite mustardy, but with enough vinegar snap for balance, plenty of egg and celery, and just enough seasoning. The pesto salad was very light, with just a hint of garlic and Italian herbs. Nothing fancy, but suitable.\n\nBoosting the side action, a shared order of steak fries with cheese sauce, chili, and sliced jalapeno ($4). There were plenty of peppers, chili, and cheese, in fact, quite a bit more toppings than fries. The sauce and chili both tasted canned, but I don't order a guilty pleasure and expect it to be gourmet. It certainly did the trick, though I wished we had just a few more fries to sop up the pool of spicy, leftover goo. \n\nAt the top of the sandwich list, a Philly cheesesteak with smoked beef, provolone cheese, grilled onion and bell pepper, with horseradish mustard sauce on a hoagie roll ($9.99). The toasty roll had a nice bit of chew to it, and though the smoke and horseradish were a nice combo, the texture of the meat was inconsistent. Some bites were quite chewy and dry, while others were tender and downright delicious. There was plenty of melted provolone, which helped push through the tougher bites.\n\nAs with the cheesesteak, the pastrami is also smoked in-house. We chose to try both a pastrami reuben with sauerkraut, Swiss cheese, and thousand island dressing ($8.99), and a hot pastrami with provolone, lettuce, tomato, and red onion  ($8.99), both on light rye bread. Here the flavor of the meat really stood out, but the texture was quite dry and chewy throughout. Think thick cut, slightly underdone bacon in texture, and the reuben was greasy to the touch. If it weren't for the extra effort required to chew through these, the flavors in both sandwiches would make them hands-down winners.\n\nA roll stuffed with thin sliced turkey, avocado, bacon, lettuce, tomato, red onion, and mayo/mustard was quite good ($8.99), with decent turkey and crispy bacon. Likewise, a chicken salad on white bread with chopped chicken, red onion, and mayo, topped with bacon, lettuce, and tomato ($8.99). So often the deli staple can be terribly bland, but this nicely seasoned effort was one of the very few I'd want to order again.\n\nLast up, a chicken melt of grilled chicken breast, pepper jack cheese, green onion cream cheese, lettuce, tomato, and red onion on rye ($8.99). The chicken appeared to have been marinated, then served hot off the grill. Quite moist, and the combination of flavors and textures really worked well together. Way beyond average for a grilled chicken sando, and maybe the overall winner of our meal.", "date": "2017-12-21 20:53:37"}, {"_key": "1065542", "_id": "reviews/1065542", "_rev": "_fNyr0T6--C", "review_id": "bqqHY5lvVfnAxvzkrrAINQ", "user_id": "KpCV05LiTq94BDeaLJEaMQ", "business_id": "hKzMD-okmcr6gfGG85SptA", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Not sure why all of the negative reviews.

My fiance and myself love it so much that we will be having our rehearsal dinner there and are already dreaming about how delicious the menu will be- everything is seasonal and locally sourced as possible- so the options rotate enough that you always have something new and exciting to look forward to (:  There isn't a bad seat in the house, the music is unexpectedly AWESOME- and is always played at a level where you can enjoy it while still holding a conversation without shouting- I brought my 89 year old Nana who can't stand noise and she not only enjoyed the food but loved the atmosphere so much that she walked around admiring the little touches- cute flowers at each table, saloon style hung artwork, mismatched plateware that somehow all matches in a unexplainable fashion.

These particular houses this year however did not have the yard part therefore they had to cut slabs of cardboard for us to build them on which added a bit more difficulty to the activity. I think it would have been helpful and made that part go a little smoother if they had attempted to build one themselves prior to selecting that brand for guests. I must say though they were incredibly generous with the amount of candy and icing they had bought for us.

They seemed to really enjoy talking to everyone there and offering help. One really nice young man there even bothered to hold my gingerbread house together while I tried to get the roof on.\n\nThe painting part was so much fun and my favorite part of the experience. They have a good range of vibrant colors here. I had a great deal of appreciation for the plastic palettes they handed out as well which allowed you to get five or six different colors and just bring them back to your seat without bringing the whole bottle back to your table and worrying about returning it right away for other guests.

So glad we stopped by!\n\nMy wife and I both tried one of the bundled French Bread sandwiches. Tonight's featured City Ham and Gruyere with Dijon mustard, tarragon, and mini sweet pickles (cornichons). I placed our order at the counter, paid, and gave my name. They asked if I wanted the sandwiches toasted (yes!) and that allowed me time to pick up a couple drafts at the Sun King counter. As soon as I was making my way back to our table, the Oca staff called out my name and I was good to go.\u00a0\n\nI loved the crispy crunch of the bread and the toasting brought out the flavors of the ham and cheese. Excellent pairing for the spices too. Can't wait to come back to try some of the sausages and charcuterie.\u00a0\n\n*****update******\nI made it back one evening and decided to try the Choucrote Garnie which may as well translate to \"meat lover's dream!\"  Actually, it's a \"traditional dish of France's Alsace region bordering Germany\" and the Choucrote is fermented cabbage while the Garnie means it is dressed with Riesling (white wine), herbs, potatoes, and charcuterie.\n\n This huge option is brought out in a roasting pan.  My eyes started to glaze over at all the meats.  In the center was a large peppery Knack(wurst) nestled over a large serving of the Choucrote.  To the left was a thick (a full inch) smoked rib chop that was the most tender pork chop I've had.  In the upper left corner were two Nuremberg sausage (technically much larger at about 5 inches instead of the 9 cm traditional).  The Nuremberg have a thicker casing and more in the Bratwurst family.  To the right of the Knack were a couple slices of Pancetta that looked like American bacon, but have a higher salt content.  Just below that, there were two Strasbourg frankfurters.  Oh, and there were two potatoes that were halved and roasted.\n\nThe Choucrote itself was a great surprise at how much I enjoyed it.  My mother used to make a really nasty version of sauerkraut and dressed it with white vinegar.  I hated it!  But here, the pungent odor of vinegar is replaced by the pleasing notes of the Riesling.  The sour of the dish is tempered as well, so the overall taste is quite pleasing, especially since it is warm and served thoroughly tender. (I am not a fan of the sometimes rubbery and tough texture of raw cabbage.)\n\nThe portion size suggests it is for two to four people.  They mean it on this dish!  I made really great headway on devouring the dish, but common sense struck me before I was stuffed and decided to get a to go box.  Not for the picky eater, this is a dish that goes great with a dark beer (I went with the Sun King \"Stuck in the Middle\" Milk Stout option. Yum!)\n\n*****back to the original review*****\n\nAs if I didn't have enough reasons to stop by Sun King already, now I can get great quality sandwiches while there. Note that Oca sells packaged meats to take home if you stop by to fill your growler.\n\nTech stuff: They are open generally the same hours as the brewery.  Parking is free in the Sun King lot.  A number of platters are meant for 2 to 4 people, so bring friends!\n\nReview #439\nRev #30", "date": "2017-12-08 10:25:59"}, {"_key": "1076136", "_id": "reviews/1076136", "_rev": "_fNyr03O--W", "review_id": "EaW5_jZWsDoMEHxL5B_cVw", "user_id": "Oosc-NKwEQn4LzwBc2isGA", "business_id": "hqqBYeQQ_c2FMvgGKrr59A", "stars": 3, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Mediocre food at best.

If you want well made southern food, this still isn't the place. If you want something that tastes good, well...\n      My wife and I planned a road trip from central Florida to Pigeon Forge, and we decided to make a huge diversion to try a BBQ place (Martin's) in Nashville. It, by the way, was amazing! Since we were doing that, I just had to try Nashville hot chicken in Nashville. I poured over tons of reviews, saw that it was on the cooking channel, and decided to go to Hattie B's. Having a pure love for fried chicken, and indulging in everything from Publix (don't lie, you know it's good) to Art Smith's, I just love all kinds of fried chicken. This is my opinion, 43 years qualified!\n           Let's start with the service.This place is giving the customer pre-made food. Basically fast food. It took us almost 20min just to get one plate of food, and some fingers. Honestly, that's just ridiculous. There was a long line at noon, but I thought it was because the food was going to be amazing. Instead it was because they have about 100 people in the kitchen, and all of them taking their time doing whatever they were doing back there. Efficiency is not a priority at Hattie B's.\n           Now the sides. The only good note to this review was the pimento mac n' cheese. It was a good mac n' cheese. I understand it's called pimento because it has pimentos in it, but if you're expecting that rich full flavor of pimento cheese, it's not there. If you were blindfolded, you would think it was just mac n' cheese. Nothing special.Now, the collard greens. Literally, I mean this without deviation, literally the worst greens I've ever had. They were severely under cooked, and had absolutely no flavor at all. None. Not a bit. There was no salt, no fat, no oil, no smokey flavor, nothing to make them good. It was boiled greens, that needed a lot more time to cook. Whoever came up with this recipe has no idea in the world how to cook greens.\n          Last, the chicken. Again, as serious as a fried chicken lover can be, this was inedible. I honestly could not eat it. I tried and tried, but it was completely flavorless. I got the hot, and I eat spicy food everyday. It was that, spicy. But under the spice was zero flavor. I'm guessing they do a water bath or soak on this chicken, and maybe use just plain flour to coat. If they add any seasoning to the breading, it's not nearly enough. It wasn't dry, it was just bland. My son got chicken fingers, and he didn't even finish them. There was nothing there.\n             If you want good southern style food, do not go to Hattie B's. This place is nothing more than a tourist trap with very bland and poorly prepared food. It's all hype and no delivery. This was my deepest regret on my entire trip, and if this restaurant is indicative of Nashville fried chicken, then Nashville has no idea how to fry chicken.", "date": "2017-12-22 20:45:53"}, {"_key": "1077450", "_id": "reviews/1077450", "_rev": "_fNyr06e--C", "review_id": "41d4qubSmdRieH5DZ8ksFA", "user_id": "ms-xEroA2t-JUiYbE5UDXA", "business_id": "hdsSqJ6XotB8LUyWjM0LKQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Great concept.

It seems many other people shared my idea because the tiny the restaurant had a 20-30 minute wait.\n\nWell, the wait well worth it. I ordered the beef brisket stew and the caramelized pork belly, with boiled egg and rice.\n\nThe stew was hearty and very flavorful. This place clearly doesn't rely on a pile of salt for seasoning, like I've experienced at other places that serve headache-inducing, overly salted broth. And the beef was so tender that it fell apart. The rice noodles were also cooked to perfection with the ideal bouncy texture.\n\nWhile the pork belly was good, it was well-seasoned and tender, I was expecting something a bit more grand. When caramelizing a protein, I thought the outer portion should be, at the very least, browned with a light or very light crisp on the surface.This pork didn't have the desired color or texture, it looked like it was stewed. Also, the pork belly lacked the star feature of this particular cut: the tri-layers comprised of skin and meat that are joined together by a nice layer of fat. And depending on how it was cooked, each layer lends a contrasting texture. At Cafe Nahn, it appears the chef removed the skin, which was a mild disappointment.\n\n Despite this, the dish wasn't the worse thing and had many other redeeming qualities like the aforementioned amount of flavor and tenderness. Another delicious touch was the boiled egg that was stained the color of the pork brother because it was most likely boiled in the broth.\n\nI will definitely comeback to Cafe Nahn.

Gluttony is clearly my family's favorite of the 7 deadly sins.\n\nTre: The menu included a calamari and fried smelts appetizer and two gigantic salads (arugula, shrimp, and octopus, and a salted cod and cauliflower salad), lobster ravioli (so good it was the only dish we didn't have leftovers of), a heaping portion of linguine de mare (clams, mussels, calamari, shrimp in spicy red sauce), lastly, a branzino with sauteed spinach and Chilean sea bass with tomatoes and toasted bread to dip (both incredible). For dessert they were out of cannoli but we had a delicious (and surprisingly light) limoncello vanilla cake (tiramisu and a chocolate cake were also available). We were so full, but basically in 7th Heaven.\n\nQuattro: The service was amazing- they coursed out the dishes for us since we were eating family style (definitely recommend doing so), and our waitress told us all about her family's Italian roots and traditions. We started with a complimentary roasted veggie appetizer, and finished with housemade chocolatecello on the house!\n\nCinque: It wasn't too crowded but they could accommodate parties as large as probably 7 at one table, maybe more. The restaurant can probably seat about 50 max. We called ahead to make a reservation.\n\nSei: The ambiance was lacking a little bit (bright lights and a pizza place with a big oven...) but we still had such a good time! \n\nSette: Don't forget to BYOB!\n\nIf you're looking to change up your Christmas Eve traditions (we're not actually Italian) or just trying to avoid cooking for your family on Christmas Eve, I highly recommend it!

And when I tell you that they have all of their future paint project ups on a calendar on the website, know that I haven't attempted even one.  I'm just not a painter.\n\nWhat I am, is a consumer of art.  My art of choice is food.  I love this art form and the Crafted Palette has created a work of art in making some really tasty food.  The best thing on the menu is the Shirred Eggs - two eggs and leeks buried in a creamy parmesan sauce served with some gluten free bread is SUCH a great treat.  They also have these quiche bites that are good for a quick bite.  My daughter always loves the croissant with her drink.  I've also had a couple different croissant sandwiches.  All were something I would get again.\n\nWhen we come in for Vertical Coffee it's great to have some tasty treats to snack on and cut the rumbly tumbly.  The wait for the food can sometimes be a little while, so if you are ordering, order as quick as you can after arriving.  That way you aren't waiting around for the order to come out.  I think they even do order ahead and Uber Eats.\n\nMy wife and daughter are doing the painting class right now as I type this, maybe they can give you a better idea of how fun or effective the art side of the business is.  But if you like to drink while you do your painting, they have a great wine selection and lots of cocktail choices.

My boyfriend and I went to Lafayette Square for a house tour yesterday and wanted to get brunch beforehand. Square One's brunch menu sounded really good, so I made an OpenTable reservation the night before. We were seated quickly, and the service was generally stellar throughout the experience. Unfortunately, the food was not. We ordered a Belgian waffle to share which was okay, but not outstanding. I don't know if it needed more butter in the batter or what, but it is not often that I am dissatisfied by a waffle. The real trouble came with my main dish. I ordered the Irish Skillet (I think that's what it was called) which was supposed to be corned beef hash with eggs. I am a CBH aficionado, so I was very much looking forward to it. Upon taking my first bite, my excitement dwindled. I kid you not...the hash was so spicy my nose was running after two or three bites. I have no idea why it was so spicy because the menu mentioned nothing about heat in the dish. Granted, I absolutely LOVE spicy food and the idea of hot corned beef hash is kind of intriguing, but this was so spicy that it was painful. It was the kind of spicy that you regret, and I did. I asked our waitress what made it so hot, and she said it normally wasn't and they must have over-seasoned it. Even before we got up to leave, I knew that heat would haunt me during our house tour, and it did. I had heartburn and indigestion for most of the day which really sucked. I have rarely in my life wasted food, but I didn't even take my leftovers as it was just too hot and my stomach was already upset. Generally, if I order really spicy food, I know there is a possibility I will suffer for it. What sucks is I didn't order spicy food, at least according to the menu. I will be back in the future to try the beer, but I will most certainly be skeptical if I'm ever ordering food again.", "date": "2017-12-11 15:56:13"}, {"_key": "1092253", "_id": "reviews/1092253", "_rev": "_fNyr1b2--N", "review_id": "LujvQNpz9iatZx_ziP-iNw", "user_id": "QwWD-SLuOth_Jszfvq6vcw", "business_id": "0M1l6p96IffjQi9EZsdVhw", "stars": 3, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This review is strictly for the M Club, nothing else at the Marriott, a lounge for gold members or Marriott credit card holders.

Yes, you can wear a hoodie, sweatpants and flip flops. No one cares.  I have one complaint which is that when the lounge is busy it is understaffed.
