I order one here & wow....it was terrible. Cheddar cheese? Since when? It's always been a white cheese, like mozarella or something but never cheddar. Found out that they just switched to that...well that was a bad idea. Worse cheese steak I've ever had. Even the peppers were bad. I had some that were hard and I couldn't chew them up so I had to spit them out into a napkin. I had to do this 3 separate times before I decided I can't take this anymore. I politely asked the waitress to take it off my bill because of how bad it was which she did.

They were unable to get in touch with the drivers, so I was to wait for a reschedule- which already made me upset. Then at 740, the drivers said they were on their way and would be 15 minutes. I explained my displeasure in the service, and that I am not Home but would rush back and might have  to wait 10 minutes.

We had made a reservation for a Sunday evening, but when we arrived the hostess couldn't find it.  No big deal - they weren't terribly busy and we were seated right away.  We were waited on promptly, but the waiter (who we've had before and always seemed like a reasonably professional, experienced fellow) was uncertain if the beers were ordered were actually available.  He disappeared with the drink menu and came back some minutes later with the correct beers.  We ordered the fried zucchini, which was obviously a packaged product right out of the freezer and was not very good.  There was a long delay between getting the app and the entrees arriving - like 35 minutes or so - and nothing that we ordered justified such a lengthy delay, nor were there that many other tables ordering at the same time.  The hostess (wearing a Mickey Mouse t-shirt) kept traipsing through the dining room with a large paper soda cup and someone else wearing an apron made several trips through the dining room as well - not a real professional impression.  When the entrees arrived, they were OK, although one dinner was missing a sausage that was noted on the menu as 'house made' and which we were looking forward to and some of the other entrees were not as good as we remembered them being from previous visits.  After another long delay, the waiter came by to ask if we'd like dessert.  We ordered a scoop of the habanero ice cream (which was terrific both times we've had it) and asked for a dessert menu as well.  The ice cream came, but we had to remind the waiter that he'd promised to bring a dessert menu.\n\nOverall, just not a fulfilling experience.  The Gas Lamp previously gave the impression of a slightly old-fashioned but professionally run neighborhood restaurant that had reliable food quality and consistently good service.  This time, the professionalism seemed to have slipped pretty badly, the rather sloppy, somewhat slow service could have been excused if they'd been really busy, but that wasn't the case and the food was uneven.  If you're going to charge $19 to $32 for entrees in Reno, you have to back that up with consistent quality on the plate and presentation and service that's at least as professional as you'd get in one of the many good Mexican restaurants.  \n\nOur experience doesn't seem to be isolated - there are a lot of lukewarm reviews for the Gas Lamp in the past six months or year.

I've been following articles about it since it opened, and was thrilled when my friend threw a surprise birthday party for me there. We had a large group, 14 of us, and we were seated by the bar in a very cool space. I was excited to go to the VR room, they had told my friend who made the reservation that we would have space available at 9pm in the VR room (we had a 7:30 reservation). Sadly, we did not make it there due to the insanely terrible service. Our waitress was incredibly slow. She welcomed us quickly and gave us one drink menu for all 14 of us, and when we asked for more, she gave us just another. I borrowed one from the bar so we could place our drink order. The music was super loud so we couldn't hear each other, but that's fine, I've been to restaurants with that kind of experience before and it kind of worked with the apocalyptic theme. But it made the incredible wait between when we were welcomed and when our waitress returned to take our menu even more noticeable. After at least 15-30 minutes, she came back to get our drink menu, iPad in hand. I could tell my group was already fading quickly, so I asked if we could order both drinks and dinner. She looked at me like I was nuts and said to the whole group, \"Let's just get a round of drinks in RIGHT?!?!!\" like a bad party pumper, and declined to take our food orders. And it doesn't get better from there. It was comical how long it took for her to bring drinks back and then again to take our food order. \n\nWhile we waited for our food, we finished our drinks and they sat empty for a long time. We legitimately thought we had been forgotten. Finally the waitress returned and got a second round of drink orders. One of my friends ordered the same drink twice, and it came out completely different. The first one was a light off-green color with jalapenos. The second came in a different glass, with no jalapenos, and was bright yellow. She asked if this was the same drink, and the waitress insisted that it was....even though it tasted and looked completely different. \n\nFinally, at 930, half of our tables food arrived. And of that half, half of it food was cold, and orders were incorrect. 5-10 minutes later, the other entrees came, again some parts cold and some parts warm. One of our group ordered an appetizer that arrived after they had finished their meal. The food was nothing to write home about. The experience was hilariously bad. \n\nWe ate quickly and were ready to go, the energy of the group completely fading from this horrific dining experience. It took, no exaggeration, 40 minutes to get the check. When we DID get the check, there were errors, despite the fact that the waitress took the order on an ipad which one would think would eliminate errors. It was just terrible service and incredibly disappointing. We signed our checks with sadness, giving the already included 18% gratuity with annoyance, since the service was honestly the worst I've had in years.", "date": "2018-04-08 14:38:56"}, {"_key": "1001746", "_id": "reviews/1001746", "_rev": "_fNyryIC--K", "review_id": "v_Op0ukiqHechCqKQ1R_oQ", "user_id": "uY-4YILasFRRNYBPVqX_7Q", "business_id": "azbf1HYL_cW1dAAc694Ckw", "stars": 2, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This is first time in St Louis and I wanted to try a local joint.

I think there are some parts that were definitely better than \"meh\".  But I wouldn't call this A-ok with me either.\n\nI had been looking forward to trying this place.  I had heard they were some of the best burgers in town.  The set up is a little unconventional - but I don't necessarily mind unconventional.  The \"restaurant\" is a window in the middle of a bar - with no connection between the ordering of food or drinks.  If you want food - you go to the \"window\" to order.  If you want anything to drink - you go to the bar.\n\nWe went about lunch time on a Sunday, so it wasn't overly busy.  I had a friend who had been there the Fri night a couple of days before, and said the line for food was so long they waited about 30 minutes to order their food.   The person who took our order was very friendly, explaining everything to the people in front of us, and again to us. (Maybe a hint why it takes 30 minutes to wait in line for the food.)  They menu is written on a chalkboard and is a little cryptic - and the process to pick up your food is they take your name and cell phone number and page you when your food is ready.  Hence the need for all the friendly explaining (and he was very very nice and patient).  However, maybe a short printed menu with more detailed explanations of the food and prices, with instructions of the pick up process might give people something to do while they are standing in that line, and maybe cut 10 minutes off the wait time.\n\nIn all fairness - the bar is a separate entity - however, since it is part of the experience of eating here, I think it is all relevant.  After placing our order, we went over to the bar to get something to drinks.  We ordered 2 diet pepsi's.  The bar tender was very friendly and smiled, but our drinks were served in 2 small cocktail glasses full of ice, and to say mine was 2/3's full was gracious and they were $2 each.  I'm not sure if there were free refills or not - they didn't say and I didn't ask.  While we were standing at the bar, we also got the entertainment of a very very very drunk person asking and commenting the entire encounter about - why weren't we ordering beer and that we should be drinking beer.  The bar servers who were around seemed to just ignore him.\n\nEverything was self-serve.  The ordering, getting your drinks, the pick up, there was an urn of cold ice water if you wanted water, and a pile of napkins.  I don't mean that to be a criticism - I don't think that is necessarily a negative at all.\n\nOur food was ready reasonably quickly.  I went to the window to pick up our food and they quickly detected we were missing a fry.  They grabbed one off another set of food orders ready on the line.  Possibly explaining what happened to our missing order of fries.\n\nThe other 3 people I was with all ordered burgers.  The burgers are the thin griddle style burgers like the ones served at steak and shake.  You order a single, a double, or a triple.  My friend who had been there 2 nights before suggested ordering at least a double.  They had different styles with different assorted toppings and cheeses, etc.  For the basic burger, a single was $6, a double, $8, and a triple $10.  My husband ordered a double basic burger and it was very very tasty.  However, it was $8.\n\nI ordered the Pork sandwich which the order / explainer told me was very popular.  I wasn't really in the mood for a burger, and I love cuban sandwiches (which are basically pork sandwiches), so I thought I would give it a try.  FYI - this was not advertised as a Cuban sandwich so I was not expecting one.  What I got was basically a piece of 8\" (maybe) narrow french bread sliced with a very ungenerous amount of pork in it with some cheese which appeared to be pressed in a panini maker.  It was $12.  It was fair at best and definitely not worth the $12.\n\nMy husband I both ordered a side of fries - which were good fries - not great fries - but good fries, and they were $4.50 each.\n\nAll and all our bill for the food for my husband and I without the drinks was like $30.  Considering all we got was a burger, a small pork sandwich, and 2 orders of fries, and this was all self-serve in a so-so bar atmosphere, I think that was a pretty high price to pay for what we got.  I'm not cheap by any means -  I have paid high prices for burgers and the such before, but other parts of those dining experiences to me made it worth the price.  For my $, I think there are other places in St. Louis where you can get the same food for less, or a better experience for the same $.\n\nI usually rate a place in my mind as:\n1. I can't wait to go back and it's on my list\n2. If someone suggested it, I would go, but wouldn't think to on my own\n3. If someone suggested it, I would suggest someplace else, but would go if pressed so I wouldn't be the stick in the mud\n4. I wouldn't go\n\nThis definitely fell in #3.", "date": "2018-06-09 19:27:40"}, {"_key": "1003048", "_id": "reviews/1003048", "_rev": "_fNyryLe--T", "review_id": "Kx70MVOfsPejdq9uucJxaQ", "user_id": "CceR5B98C08c11rrxLc1Jw", "business_id": "DcBLYSvOuWcNReolRVr12A", "stars": 1, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Food was fking horrible, avoid at all costs.

We were not there for the same reasons. \n\nLet me start off by saying the front desk staff name Raquet was exceptionally helpful during my unfortunate experience. \n\nThis hotel should get  1 star for their quality of their linen and rooms. \n\nMy experience is was awful. I checked into the hotel last Friday night and when I walked into the hotel, I had to announce myself in order for someone to come to the desk. I was then checked in and given my room key. After I checken in i proceeded to my room. I travel often so as a routine I check the bedding prior to getting settled into a room. I checked the bed and it was SOILED so I called the front desk 3 times and there was NO ANSWER. I then went down stairs to the front desk where I had to announce myself again for someone to come to the desk. I informed the staff of my issue and they moved me to a room 2 doors down. I then went to that room and checked the bedding and it was ok. I then went to take a shower and there was mold all on the back of the hard plastic sliding partition. I couldnt take a shower after a long day at work and a long drive to PA. I immediately contacted the front desk and was infomred there was nothing they could do for me that night, I would need to speak to the assistant GM in the morning . I asked what time the person came in and she stated 7am. \n\nI went to the front desk the next morning at 9:30am and I was told the manager did not get in until 3 pm. Now I was frustrated because I had plans and I was unable to do them because I now had to wait for the manager to get in. Well the front desk staff Raquet ask if she could move me to another room and was very helpful. I was informed I would be moving to the 3rd floor and they will call my room so I can meet their staff there when they got upstairs because the only elevator was out of service. I then went back to my room and I received a phone call from Raquet who stated she will move me to a room on that floor due to the elevator being down. i was informed I could go to the new room to look and make sure everything was ok. Well, I went to the room and my lady checked the bedding and for sure there were more stains. Raquet was then asked to come to the room.  Raquet asked if she could change the sheets instead of changing the rooms for the 4th time and I stated yes. When house keeping came into the room, they literally tried 5 different sheets and all of them had stains on them. At that time I was disgusted. The finally was able to find a sheet that didn't have a stain and placed the linen on the bed. \n\nAt 3:30 I went down stairs and spoke to Cheryl and I explained everything mentioned about. Cheryl apologized and offered me a $75 credit to use at another best western hotel in the future. She stated that all she could offer because the hotel was able to resolve my issue. i informed her we were not satisfied with that because my issues was not resolved until the next day. I wasted an entire night and morning because I was inconvenienced by the multiple room changes and ordeal of sitting there to watch housekeeping put linen on my bed and having to wait to 3pm to speak with the GM. She then stated she would cal corporate on Monday to see what she could do and she would then call me. Well today is Thursday and I have yet to hear from her. I called there this afternoon and I was informed she was in a meeting. I left a message for a call back. \n\nI then called corporate and informed them of my issue with my stay and they stated they could spoke to the hotel about the issue and the hotel offered me a $75 credit. I informed them I was not satisfied with that because  I travel a lot and this was my first time staying at a best western and this experience has completely turned me off from doing business with this hotel chain in the future. CORPORATE INFORMED ME THEY COULDNT REFUND ME THE MONEY BECAUSE THE HOTEL IS THE ONE WHO PROCESSES THE PAYMENTS. They then offered to send me a $30 check and I then asked to speak to a supervisor. The lady told me the supervisor has the same power as her but she will let me speak to a supervisor. I was placed on a very long hold and then the same young lade came back on the phone and she then stated she was informed she can send me a $75 check. confused as to why I couldnt speak to a supervisor and still not satisfied I stated Ill take the $75 dollar check but I am definitely going to write a review about this. \n\nThe Rep then said Well have a Good Day... I was confused again and said dont you need my address to send the check. \"She then said no because if your going to go to social media then thats your resolution\".  I then said hold up so your telling me the only way you will give me a check is if I do not write a review about my experience with the Best Western I stayed at and Corporate. She then said \"um um no what your address\". \n\nI am very unsatisfied with the hotel and corporate", "date": "2018-07-19 19:15:13"}, {"_key": "1003698", "_id": "reviews/1003698", "_rev": "_fNyryMq--T", "review_id": "qFREWFp-D4BAWmuclO4Kfw", "user_id": "90IYX76-kC6Uunqm1ZPwSQ", "business_id": "HP03UxUpfwic04tBuqsqPw", "stars": 2, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Let me prefaced this review by saying I'm Thai.

Since purchasing this car I have some issues where Conicelli did the right thing rectify my dissatifaction as I had to chase down people to get what I needed and was promised. I overlooked it because they were kind to bring my car back to NJ almost an hour away so I didn't have to make the trip. Well, on Sunday June 3rd I discovered water coming throughmy headliner area, between the console and a few other places. I had called another Nissan dealer to look at the issue in hand as I live a few minutes from this other dealership and figured it was an easy fix. Well, I received a phone call back stating that there was some damage caused by the issue of the water and to my dismay this was the only time this happened that there was leaking in this area. When I spoke with the Service area at the other dealership they stated that I call my insurance company to have an adjuster come out to look at the issue because of it being a maintaenance issue. I have had cars for over 30 years and I have never had an issue with the drains or even people I know I asked never heard of this being an issue. My adjuster came out from the insurance company said that the issue is not covered under my comprehensive coverage as this should be covered under my Nissan warranty and plus the damage to the car has been pending for awhile even way before I bought the car. I opened a claim with Nissan Customer/Consumer Affairs and they said that they will not cover the issue and she did follow up with Conicelli if they would cover this as this car has mold, headliner issues, car replacement, body harness issue, etc so this would be that bad within a 2 day period so it has to be there for at least a year. They stated they would not cover the cost since it was not a warranty issue. I have done so much leg work on this issue and someone needs to be responsible for this as this is my first purchase of a Nissan and my first transaction with Conicelli. I see these commerical about stress free buying and we stand on our head for you. This whole situation has been stressful as I'm just truly disappointed with this entire issue as no one is standing behind their product or lack of interest for the customer is terrible. I feel in no way or form that this issue is neglect on my end. My car is still at the other dealership I was told by Nissan let's keep it there until we can get this fixed, but of course it built up your hopes to have this fixed and they said no and no one wants to step up to the plate to help. They want the permission to tear up my car, but if it not covered then I have to pay to get it put back. Now I have to pick up my car and nothing has been fixed for over 2 weeks so hopefully there will be no heavy rains so the issue continues and there will be additional damage. Out of anyone since I bought the car from Conicelli I feel that they should stand behind the car as it has been damaged for awhile and with the mold it can hamper my health as I already have health issues and my families health. I'm hoping someone from the Senior Management Team will follow up with me on this issue as the right thing needs to be done. I just want to Thank Jack Depre as he listened to my concerns and hoping he can also help me rectify this situation.

My wife, son, & I stayed there July 25-28 2018, & let me be clear, we will NEVER stay there again. Let's cover the basics. First, we check in to a room where the HVAC unit was not working. Oh, it was blowing, blowing hot air. After their Engineering team spent over 30 minutes trying to find the problem, we asked for another room because it was 10:00pm, we had driven in from San Antonio, & we were tired. They DOWNGRADED us because that was \"all they had\". Instead of trying to find us a room like we had reserved at another property, they downgraded us. Didn't offer to pay for parking, didn't offer ANYTHING. So, we move to our new room, which was not Hilton standards if you ask me, but it was cool, had a halfway decent bed, & we were tired. Next morning I asked the front desk if they had adjusted my rate to the DOWNGRADED room that I had been moved to. They were going to CHARGE ME THE SAME RATE!!!  Can you say \"NO!\"  After a very short, but charged discussion, they changed my rate to what it should be. We check out, PAID THE ROOM IN FULL (pay close attention to that last statement), & went home. A week and a half later, we discover that there is an additional pending charge for the EXACT SAME AMOUNT that we had already paid in full on our credit card. I sent the General Manager an email stating so. He replied that it was impossible for them to do that. Amazing, this morning (after him saying that was impossible), the holds were all gone. This place is a joke!!!  There are so many nicer places to stay in New Orleans, don't waste your time here!!", "date": "2018-08-06 14:36:07"}, {"_key": "1006749", "_id": "reviews/1006749", "_rev": "_fNyryX---P", "review_id": "pxztXlKyGBXegmzy1ZTBOA", "user_id": "z0yuKDe1fD_H54WfOXKEbw", "business_id": "P4vdu-vKODLmeOl8jQciFQ", "stars": 1, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I would not recommend using PhilaPets.

The worst dining experience I have ever had in my life and I will absolutely never return. The night started by being brought to our table, Dennis came over to our table and said \"drinks\" pointed at one of the people in our party and said \"you go\". No recommendations on drinks whatsoever. Drinks took quite a while for beers and wine considering it wasn't very busy at all. Dennis came to take our order and the first guest in our party asked about the soups to which Dennis replied \"the lentil soup has been sitting out all day don't get it.\" We placed our order and I asked about the soup of the day to which his response was \"clam chowder and it's disgusting, you don't want that.\" At this point everyone in our party felt very uncomfortable. One of the guest in our party is a GM for a restaurant and was appalled at the quality of service and the way in which the server was talking. The server station was right behind us and all we could hear was him getting on another sever about not sticking receipt tape, and also when a table walked in he sternly said \"oh no I'm not taking that table.\" We stopped for a quick dinner and to enjoy our evening but it was anything but enjoyable at that point. The table next to us told Dennis that he needed another ice tea and he responded with \"yeah I know it's empty I saw \" you could see how uncomfortable he made the guests at that table. Our drinks were empty as well and he just kept walking by the table. We got our meals and he quickly walked by and said Is everything ok? I was drinking my water so I wasn't able to say that my meal was awful before he ran off. He never came back so I wasn't able to tell him that my meal was awful and instead watched everyone else eat. When I told him that my meal was awful he tried to argue with me  about it. I was completely blown away by this. He took the meal off the bill and pulled some coupons out of his wallet.

I will not be going back to lego land.  They do have a store with a good selection of lego toys for both older and younger kids but that was the only thing I enjoyed.

I can understand that fresh food takes long and that is why we waited more than an hour but more than 1 hour and 20 min is unacceptable. To top this off we asked to talk to a Manager so we may speak about the service and a series of excuses were given for his absence. First, that it was too late to have a Manager on site, then that he had just lefted to do some shopping. How is it that a establishment that probably seats 150+ people does not have a Manager on site until it closes? I am totally baffled on how the employees would deal with a situation without the necessary leadership of a Manager. I was even more disappointed when staff told me that they called the Manager whose name is Santos and his response was leave a complaint and he would get to it tomorrow.

First time trying this deli. Wish we hadn't bothered. I grew up in the area, but had never gone here in the past with my Jewish mother or relatives. Maybe because it's so mediocre, and parking is a nightmare too, especially when it's raining or snowing (does it even still snow in St. Louis??), or when it's hot, humid and very sticky outside, as it was the day we came in. We were not impressed with the parking situation or the food quality.\n\nOne star is for the good service by the younger woman behind the counter. \n\nThe older woman behind the counter (the owner?) ignored us when we came in. It's just as well she didn't make eye contact or speak to us, after what others have written here about her demeanor. If you're going to be rude to customers, then you should not be running a customer service biz, or you should not be out front engaging with them. \n\nOne star for the variety of drinks and food stuffs on the shelves, but the rest of our experience wasn't great. \n\nParking here was very difficult. The tiny private lot didn't appear to have any reserved spaces for Protzel's customers. All the spaces appeared to be reserved for the other businesses. Street parking was impossible to find within two blocks, and it's all metered, unless you drive further down Wydown. We parked in a space supposedly reserved for the real estate biz.\n\nThe chicken live pate was the most boring I've ever had, not much to get excited about. Still, I bought some because I didn't feel like going elsewhere, it's what I had come in for, and we didn't have the time to go anywhere else. The pastrami and the corned beef were both way too fatty, stringy and tough, not tender and tasty. Fat usually imparts meat with some tenderness and flavor. Can't say it did either for these. Didn't buy any after tasting both. We ended up buying some chicken salad, the pate, some toasted rye bread, a couple of drinks, some chips, and a couple of other items not from the deli counter. I tried all the salads too, but only found one of them to my liking, one of the coleslaws, so got a serving of that too.\n\nThe shop felt old and dingy, but then it likely is old. It could use a refresh, but I doubt they will ever do one.\n\nMy recommendation, go elsewhere.

(I shall come back and be the guinea pig - more on that later!)\n\nAnywho, we went after work with plans to have a few drinks and then slide for dinner plans elsewhere. The first hint to leave should've been when we stood in the lobby with about 5 different members of staff that completely ignored us until we decided it must just be self seating and sat at the bar (still unsure if a hostess exists). Then the bartender ignored us too. Once capturing his attention he walks over and says what do you guys want (1: we're females and 2: shouldn't you offer a menu?!?!). So I asked for a menu. I really felt uncomfortable doing that because ummm, like... why did I have to? We decide on drinks and the bartender comes over and takes our order. In the meantime he serves me my drink then appears to ask another worker about the recipe (how'd you know you made the drink properly if you're unsure?). Drink tastes fine. Kinda like alcoholic cucumber water. I mean that in a good way as unattractive as that description sounds. Also, I found it a bit strange that he was adamant about putting out my flaming lime as if I was somehow going to set my weave on fire. Weird. \n\nWe reluctantly help ourselves to another round of drinks and then it really goes downhill from there. Apparently MR was hosting some type of business mixer event for some organization and our service went from pretty shitty to outright nonexistent. Bit of a boisterous crowd that we weren't expecting and would not have ordered another drink knowing the influx of people would be so dramatic. I'm assuming the bartender figures his tips were already made for the night so we were expendable. I'm pretty certain if we weren't morally conscious individuals we could've dipped on the bill and it would've taken the bartender until clock out to realize it. I later saw on Instagram that MR introduced a happy hour menu a few weeks prior to our visit that was not mentioned or offered. After having to put in the effort of asking for a menu at the very least you could provide ALL available options! So not a good bar experience. \n\nStill, I am intrigued enough to come back and try MR for food (and drinks *side eye*) if to do nothing but to justify or update this 2 star review. My first impression wasn't the best so this isn't a place I'm willing to expense. I will instead take an unsuspecting young gentleman that is trying to win my affection to absorb the costs of what may very well likely be another waste of money/time.

The whole experience was painful and extremely infuriating. I wish I could give zero stars. Here was my experience with them:\n\n1) Eat at any normal pho place and they usually serve it within 10 minutes or less within ordering because it's their specialty. My party of 6-7 arrived at 9am to pho cali, placed our order around 9:15, but waited FORTY FIVE minutes to get our pho - and a full HOUR to get the rest of the non-pho orders. Not to mention, they didn't serve it at the same time so some people were eating while others had to wait and that was awkward. Waiting 45 minutes for pho is ridiculous (especially when you have 'Pho' written in your store name) and the pho itself was subpar. Not anything special.\n\n2. ALL of the workers were RUDE!!! And have no self awareness or knowledge of customer service. This included the person who took our order, our waiter, and the cashier. We had asked them why our orders were taking so long and it was excuse after excuse: \"yeah there's a long list of orders today\" or \"the kitchen Is very busy\".... ??? We asked three times at our table getting the same answer until around 45 minutes I actually got up heading towards the kitchen to ask the waiters where our pho was and to let them know we had been waiting too long. The waiter's answer at that time was \"let me check on it for you.\"  In all our interactions there was absolutely no mention of \"Sorry about the wait\" or \"it should be coming right out\" - all the workers seemed to be lacking the most basic customer service skills which made the experience that much more angering.\n\n3. So finally at the end of the hour when we received our non-pho dishes the waiters had actually messed up our order and given us the WRONG plate of food. We were so hungry and angry at that time we decided to just take it (didn't want to wait probably another 30 mins for them to figure out where the correct dish was). Anyway we then end up going to the front of the cash register to pay and explained the situation that hey - it took us a full hour to wait for hour food not to mention that they had messed up our non pho food order, they should give us a discount or at least not charge us for the dish that we ordered but they never delivered. The lady at the front register refused (again never apologized!!) and said we had to pay the full price. She then sent one of the waiters to come and look at the non-pho dish they had served to confirm that it was indeed a wrong order but then said since we had \"eaten it anyway\" we should pay full price. We knew they wouldn't budge and wanted to just get out of that place so we ended up paying and then left.\n\nBut man! It put all of us in a bad mood for that while morning. And for food that wasn't really all that special - I can say it definitely wasn't worth putting up with the wait and extremely rude staff!!! I would not recommend people to eat at this place - there are better pho and viet places in Reno you can go to for better food and definitely better service.", "date": "2018-01-14 19:09:45"}, {"_key": "1010830", "_id": "reviews/1010830", "_rev": "_fNyryfG--R", "review_id": "5Eqj6rOyxQaU-CqPFd7W4g", "user_id": "FLwoDcDm49ClaYSsqPYa7w", "business_id": "Jfvd4mr8axS3l5i_Segw4g", "stars": 1, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Service is slow , food is nothing special .

We got so hungry, we contemplated ordering jimmy johns so that we could eat something but gave them the benefit of the doubt. When the food FINALLY came, it was missing the toast, syrup and was cold. It had sat in the window so long it wasn't even warm. The waitress said she'd be right back with missing toast and syrup (which she wasn't) so 10 minutes later, we asked a manager who was standing behind the counter - instead of doing it, he told another waitress to do it, taking even longer. When we asked for the check, nothing happened.  Frustrated, we began calculating what it would be to just leave cash, and began to hear the do-nothing manager yelling at the absent waitress. Instead of waiting for him to finish scolding her, another man just stood up and asked for their check that was also taking entirely too long. She finally comes to the table crying with check and blamed the bad service on being yelled at by her boss. It was just an awful brunch experience and I'd rather let my Groupon go bad than sit through that again.", "date": "2018-08-25 21:42:10"}, {"_key": "1011629", "_id": "reviews/1011629", "_rev": "_fNyryg2--G", "review_id": "uy6lh-Z0Sn7IoLViVHiepQ", "user_id": "eNgMrVChBRXLvmwIcK3YQw", "business_id": "GdX5jRGWpvEm6KEkdrXq1A", "stars": 2, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Love Chipotle, but ordered double chicken and barely got a full scoop.

The drinks have interesting names but for $15 I would expect more than the portion and the amount of ice in the drinks. My date had the baked cheese \"entree\" and by the time she was done she said that it was an\"ok appetizer\" . I had the pork chop due to the reviews I saw about it. It was overcooked and not too flavorful... Again, I wanted to enjoy this place sooo badly but if you want to spend $100 plus tip (including a couple of happy hour items) , there are many other quality spots in the neighborhood that you can get a higher quality meal.", "date": "2018-08-25 14:35:57"}, {"_key": "1012939", "_id": "reviews/1012939", "_rev": "_fNyryji--F", "review_id": "jpaIXn8-NEfQbJy8joHAEQ", "user_id": "6jdlxAtUgSzrZe5CX-F9XQ", "business_id": "HgPTy_OGoaxllb2EXkC1sQ", "stars": 2, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Used to be great.

Now.... well...\n\nThe food has lost its charm, quite frankly. The burgers are over cooked; well or well done when you specify a medium degree of doneness. The fries? The fries taste like they just came out of a frozen bag, some of them not even cooked all the way. If I wanted fries that were nuked in the microwave, I would have made that poor decision myself.\n\nI asked for macaroni salad, and well... I got it. I got a frozen macaroni salad. They did not even have the courtesy to serve me the correct temperature. And the Big Kahuna? More like the Town Fool. The rice is sometimes way overcooked, and certain meat portions are served cold. Cold!\n\nThe packaging? What were you thinking? Who approved that idea? We were given paper boxes for our food, which soaked through the bottom and leaked all over and tore. \n\nThe service? Lackluster. The girls are short in attitude and often rude. One lady, as sweet as she is, has difficulty hearing customers place their order. I think she needs an area where she can still do her job, but not take customer orders, bless her heart. We sometimes see the manager out and about, looking like an angry man.\n\nI used to take my son here often, but time and time again we are sadly let down.

I called yet again this morning and was told that his wife just had a baby.  And?  What does his wife having a baby have to do with him issuing me a refund check?  My husband is an active duty Marine and is getting deployed this year.  I'm a Marine Corps Veteran who was injured while on active duty, my dad is having kidney issues, my mom has diabetes and high blood pressure, my grandmother died a few years ago, my kitchen was flooded due to Derek Simons' negligence, and I have to tear down my kitchen walls due to him puncturing my waterline and not fixing it.\n\nUpdate 1/10/2018:  He responded to my BBB complaint with all kinds of excuses as to why he performed substandard work, but did offer to return my money.  We called him today and his wife answered.  We told her to tell him to get this pump and return our money, but of course, he didn't return our call.  I've been checking my mailbox everyday and there is no check from this company.  The pump he installed didn't actually pump the water as he said it would and at least 20 gallons of disgusting water was stagnated beneath my sink.   How wonderful.  Oh, and the Sewage and Water Board of New Orleans came out to inspect my house today.  All plumbers in the New Orleans area answer to this inspector. He couldn't believe what he was seeing and has NEVER seen such terrible work in all his years!  Derek Simons, come get this pump and the rest of your garbage that you left at my house!  WE WANT OUR MONEY BACK RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!! \n\nUpdate 1/9/2018:  We decided to stop by Derek Simons \"office\" since he refuses to answer phone calls and respond to text messages.  Well, wouldn't you know the address he listed on Yelp belongs to the UPS Store!  He fabricated his office address and is IMPOSSIBLE TO GET IN CONTACT WITH once he had our money in his clutches!   We have made the decision to pursue legal action against Hurricane Drain because he destroyed our property and won't return the money.  I have reported him to the Plumbing Board and the BBB so this won't happen to anyone else.  He has yet to get in touch with us to rectify the issues.  I don't understand why his rating is so high.  Just snoop around a bit on the internet and you will find other complaints. Do not use this company!\n\n\nHiring Hurricane Drain has been the one of worst decisions I've ever made in my life! I hired this company on 12/14/2017 to fix a broken kitchen drain line located beneath the slab.  Derek assured me that he would be able to fix it.\n\n12:14/17:  He cuts through my beautiful hardwood floors and began drilling several holes into my foundation.  About half way through, he decided that he couldn't do it and abandoned the job, leaving holes in my floor.  He never refilled the holes in the foundation as stated on the estimate.  After this failure, he recommended a sink pump.  \n\n12/15/17:  Derek Simons installs a sink pump under my kitchen sink.  One major problem is he completely destroyed my venting system in my attic in the process! He cut the vent pipe that extends from the roof and capped the end. The other piece of my vent pipe was then used to reroute the kitchen line to my master bath.  Fun fact:  this type of \"repair\" is unheard of!  Another fun fact: the vent pipe extending from the roof is filling with rain water because, well, it has NO WHERE TO GO due to him capping the end.  The weight of the water will eventually cause the pipe to crash through my ceiling because he didn't have the decency to secure it. \n\nOh, but that's not the end.  \n\nHe removed a drain pipe in my kitchen, but failed to replace it.  Guess what happened next?  Major flooding!  Did he bother to fix the flooding?  No he did not.  In fact, I mentioned it before he left and he said, \"monitor it and call me if it gets worse...It might be your water line\".  My water line isn't leaking.  It's the gaping hole you left in my floor!  Everything was worse the following day (12/16/2017), so I texted him the picture and followed up with phone call.  He actually answered that time and told me, \"I'm going to my wife's baby shower. I'll check it out tomorrow.\"  Sunday comes and he never calls nor did he show up.  I texted him more pictures because it's getting worse. He never responded.  I finally call a different plumber on Monday, 12/18/2017. \n\nThe new plumber who saw the contraption in my attic and mess under my sink was flabbergasted!  He said he's never seen such terrible work in his 30 years of being a plumber.  \n\nI regret hiring this company so much!!!  He never actually fixed what I hired him for, destroyed my property, and made everything much worse.  He just took my money and scurried off.  He refuses to return my money and honor the warranty. I not only have to spend more money to fix the original problem, but now have the added cost of repairing the damage he caused.

She didn't even tell me her name.  She was distracted waiting for a phone call.  I informed her that I had sensitive skin and she didn't adjust her application at all.  Let's go through everything that went wrong. \n1. There's no new client/ consent form that covers skin type, allergies,  medications,  or any other pertinent information.\n2. A roll on wax applicator is not sanitary because even if you wipe down the roller, dead skin cells have rolled into the wax and now will roll onto the next client.  \n3. They use hard wax on the most sensitive areas (Brazilian and underarms) which is definitely a no go for sensitive skin like mine. It requires way too much force to pull off. \n4. I informed her the wax was too hot and she did nothing to make sure it cooled. Just continued to apply the too hot wax. \n5. Almost a month later and I have permanent hyperpigmentation in the areas that were red for 4 days after my appointment.  The sad areas the hard wax was too hot.  \n6. Let's not forget,  I still had patches of wax residue on my legs when I left which now had collected all kinds of dirt. \n7. She claimed that the hair was long.  Ok,  and as a professional if the hair is longer than standard you know to trim it down some before aggressively waving it. \n8. When waxing the backside of the Brazilian I nearly felt hog tied trying to lay on my stomach and hold my buttocks. It's way easier to get on your elbows and knees because it naturally spreads the buttocks, prevents flinching,  and reduces discomfort.  \n\nSo after this horrible appointment I'm left trying to figure out how to get rid of horrible hyperpigmentation and ingrown hair bumps.

The family has been in the restaurant business for some time now with Seoul Garden (St. Charles Rock Road) and Kimcheese, but they have completely missed the mark with this restaurant.  \nTheir waiting area is pretty much non-existent and very cramped.  It will not hold more than 10 people comfortably.  You can however get up close and personal with the not-so-well maintained giant fish aquarium.  \nThey do not have a permanent host/hostess.  They rely on their \"head\" waiter to figure out the seating for the entire restaurant.  Our party of 8 waited for 45 minutes as we saw many other 4-5 person groups come in after us and continue to get seated well ahead of us. When I inquired why other groups were being seated ahead of us with head \"waiter\"/\"host\", he completely lost it with me in front of other patrons and was extremely rude and condescending.   I'm not sure if customer service and handling pressure are quite his strong points.  It's been a long time since I have been that upset with a restaurant staff person.\nAfter this whole ordeal, we were finally sat at our table.  We had to ask for menus and silverware.  We put in our order of the \"Premium\" all you can eat Korean bbq.  Needless to say, our first order of all you can eat meat took an extremely long time to receive as we filled up on the side dishes.  They brought to the table 1 plate of Beef Bulgogi for all 8 people to share before we even received eating utensils.  It was at least 12 minutes before we received another plate of meat.  I do believe they must have run out of LA Short Ribs due to the fact that I saw an older asian gentlemen was carrying a clear bucket full of raw beef from the front entrance of the restaurant to the back kitchen.  \nAlong with your all you can eat (AYCE) meal, you are able to choose 1 pot soup.

Woooooow what a big break that is and how is that going to help me pay for dental work now? \n\nTheir insurance (Broadspire) company said their burgers are delivered frozen every day (per Raychell Watson from Broadspire) so it's not Red Robin's problem. Now I have $2,000 in Care Credit debt and Red Robin passed the bill and couldn't even apologize. I will NEVER return to the this location! Think about it.... $10 frozen burger and with bones in it.

You and your staff are not able to handle when someone is telling you that they were treated poorly and didn't like the service. This is business 101. You and your staff should figure out where you guys dropped the ball instead of putting energy into going back-and-forth with me on a public platform. You should probably invest that energy into making sure that unfortunate things like this don't happen again. I would not recommend this place to an enemy. We did not deserve that treatment, and the fact that you're trying to justify it reflects poorly on you. Learn how to take criticism and charge the issues instead of arguing with multiple customers on your short comings. You failed as a leader because you are not  people directing your team, instead you are telling them that customer are not always right. But what can I expect when their leader does not know leadership. I would not advise anyone to visit this restaurant because of the lack of compassion that was given from the owner or co-owner of this establishment. There is no need to try to win me back over as I am already done. Again I do not want or need your apology, but you should do better for the sake of the business and not desire treat them in the manner that you have. \n\n{Update #2} \nI just received a private message from the \"co-owner\" of this establishment which definitely shed a ton of light on the situation that happened. If the leader does not practice good customer service then the staff WILL NOT!! This makes so much sense because we were treated horribly by the staff here and nothing was being done about it. But this message I was just sent from the co-owner explains why. She does not take pride in serving others so why should the staff. Horrible and sad! She has fallen as a leader. \n\n      -Response: \"I was out of town when you visited our restaurant. My response was not rushed as I waited until after speaking to all employees involved. \n\nI did not blame you 'just for coming to the establishment' but simply explained the situation to you in it's entirety. \n\nI am quite aware of what customer service is and should be. My staff does as well. We aren't always perfect, but that's because we're human.\n\nI do not promote a 'customer is always right' mentality because, simply put, they aren't. Customers are human too. Clearly mistakes were made in this situation by guests and staff and for that we apologize.\n\nEnjoy your Sunday,\nMaria\"\n\n{Update} \nI really appreciate your urgency to respond to this negative rating. However, the treatment we received was UNACCEPTABLE and that same urgency should been extended then! I appreciate that you pointed out that my replacement food was free and you hoped I enjoyed it, as I did not even eat it because it became cold as I'm trying to deal with rudeness and unprofessionalism for the staff. Forget the food, I'm just trying to get comfortable at this point. So if you're the \"co-owner\" then you should know a thing or two about decent customer service and leadership and should have lead your team on how to properly handle situations like this instead of blaming us just for coming to the establishment. I would recommend sitting down with your team and using this situation as a teaching tool on what NOT to do to your customers who thought well enough of this place to have our girls gathering there. This was heartbreaking to say the least. I don't need your apologies, just do better as a leader.", "date": "2018-03-25 18:36:17"}, {"_key": "1016296", "_id": "reviews/1016296", "_rev": "_fNyryp2--a", "review_id": "I8EQCt5VT-VT5rboGtt6LA", "user_id": "HrFG_OpbR_R79RSnQKdRmQ", "business_id": "APQWf69OTUQwbYssNNgjCw", "stars": 2, "useful": 4, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This used to be my go to place.

It makes me wonder when a good restaurant stops updating their menu for a while.  Same old same\nOld stuff.  Need something exciting and new.  Anyway, got the beef tenderloin medallions $22 for two slices of meat ( thin,small and maybe 4oz ), half a plate of mashed potatoes and a small\nSide of veg in the corner of the plate , edged over with the pound of potatoes on the plate. Chewiest piece of tenderloin ( probably a cheaper cut or a bad cut of tenderloin), a mound of potatoes, 1 small carrot, 4 green beans and a half a spoonful of mushy zucchini.   So meats are getting expensive, potatoes are cheap and veg adds some color.   Disproportionate servings, lots of filler on the pate because it's cheap and little veg ( veg prices must be going up to). Definitely not a $22 portion of protein, maybe $14-$15 plate but definitely not $22. We got 2 entrees, 2 appetizer, 3 ice teas and a drink $88.  Wow, maybe if they actually have a decent 7-8oz meat portion but not the scraps of meat with a mound of potatoes.  Some of the prices are good for the portions and quality.  Burgers are still great and prices decent.  But the main meals definitely changing.  I think we need to find a new place to dine.  Service is always excellent, the water , lemon  and bread is the best part and made this place great for me but now I see portions getting disproportionate and the food quality on the main Menu is now ......meh..... ok.

Bad choice in my part.\n\nWhen I walked in I was greeted by a man sitting in a chair in the middle of the dimly lit dining room. He was nice, but probably 30 seconds into me looking at the menu he made a suggestion as to what I should get as if I had never had it before. It wasn't like it was busy and I was holding up the line, I was literally the only other person in the store. \n\nI ordered the chicken Shwarma wrap to go with veggies, hummus, and salad. I kind of looked around, but the place didn't have much. It looks like they had started to add some decor and ambiance, but just gave up halfway through. I started looking in the back and noticed that the machines in the very open kitchen we're both dirty and non operational. The Shwarma rotisserie wasn't on.... Where was my food coming from? \n\nI waited about 20 minutes which seemed excessive, but I figured maybe because of the slow business they just microwave it to order. I get it, I've worked in slow restaurants. When I finally got my order, it wasn't to go. When I asked the guy if I could get it to go, he handed me a grocery bag and said something to the tune of \"I think it fits\". \n\nAt this point I'm pretty excited for my food and I grab the wrap out as I walk. I unwrap it to see.... A tortilla. My Shwarma wrap was a toasted flour tortilla, like a burrito. Weird, but whatever; in my mind I've already kind of accepted that this place is cutting corners, and besides, you don't get a Shwarma wrap for the wrap, you get it for the meat!\n\nThe dry, cubed, white chicken breast meat. The chicken appeared to be white breast meat cubed and tossed in a spicy harrisa sauce. Overall, the flavor of it was pretty good, but it was not the fatty, juicy meat that you expect when you purchase Shwarma. The wrap was also pretty skimpy on the meat, although that may have been a result of them using a 12in tortilla for what would normally be a 8in pita. It had lettuce and tomato in it, maybe onions but I'm not sure to be honest.\n\nAs for the sides, there's not much to talk about. The hummus itself was good, although the \"garnish\" was about an entire tablespoon of smoked paprika. Vegetables were carrots and celery, and the salad was basically just shredded romaine. I didn't eat it if I'm being honest so I don't know if it was dressed or not, but the fact that that is even a question shows my expectations for this place. \n\nAll in all, it's a bad restaurant. About the only redeeming factor was that they had fresh peppercorn and pink rock salt grinders on the tables, which was pretty cool I guess. \n\nTLDR: Go to Suris behind the hospital and actually enjoy your food.", "date": "2018-03-16 21:52:57"}, {"_key": "1017719", "_id": "reviews/1017719", "_rev": "_fNyrytm--A", "review_id": "OXNt-LPe-9IN7EQzMZrFBw", "user_id": "E13itBqmKI0R1svWAMvfcw", "business_id": "WkAOE6OhcKwdufE87pqv8A", "stars": 1, "useful": 0, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "text": "This is honestly the worst pedicure I've ever gotten.

I didn't realize that resold clothing stores had sale but whatever, I kept a good outlook and told her it was no big deal because the items were pretty cheap already.

We payed and she realized she made a mistake. We were told the card had to be rang up again cause she had thought the two items were a set, no we wanted to match them and ended up finding a perfect set. So SHE didn't check and scan both, in turn asking if we knew of this? We said yes because we wanted to match them and she told us that it was on the same hanger and that's why she didn't scan both.. umm so now she's insinuating that we were trying to pull a fast one when she should have been checking?

She was running around like a chicken with her head cut off as were all of the other servers. The environment was buzzing with stress. They didn't have silverware and were going to give out plastic ware until they finally found forks. We ordered our meals and when they finally came out after about 30-45 mins of waiting, the toasted ravioli was warm not hot while my partners food was all cold. The pancakes were crunchy (originally ordered banana bread but found out that was out) and the meat, hash browns, and egg were cold. I flagged down our server on one of her numerous running bye to tell her the food was cold. She then asked what we wanted to do. We could either eat the food and she would discount it or we could send it back and get new food made. She pushed us into keeping it because the server kept saying \"you need food in your stomach\" but my partner took another bite and said it was cold and terrible.

Unfortunately all the great things don't make up for underlying customer service issues.  The more I stayed there I realized something is seriously wrong, new management is needed, and serious customer service training.  Every time I stay, something happens. There was the time I entered my room to find no bedding, the time there was one feather pillow left in my room \"feather free' room when I'm extremely allergic, the time my room reeked of food and I found ketchup (not mine) spilled on the desk, the time the shuttle never arrived & I was fearful I was going to miss my flight and no one at the front desk seemed to care,  the time $45 dollars in parking charges appeared on my bill when I had not been charged in over a year for any parking.  The front desk said \" yes there was a change in policy - no they were not informing quests in advance- and yes I had to pay it,\"  and this last time when I was promised a free upgrade only to find an additional $100 on my bill .

We took my sister-in-law and her kids here today and I'm just amazed that what is effectively an arcade with amenities like restaurants could be so clueless about children. \n\nAfter checking out a few games, the kids were peckish, so we tried to go to their \"quick service\" food spot -- The Shed. It was closed, so our only option was the more expensive Three10. We went over there and found a number of other families waiting in line to be seated. It was here we were told that The Shed was closed because it wasn't felt they would be busy enough to warrant it being open (this was a Saturday afternoon on a smokey day in August and, remember, there were already a number of families who has unsuccessfully tried to eat there. During our time in the restaurant, TEN MORE tables of families would be seated after trying first to eat at the more affordable/faster Shed). \n\nFirst, they tried to seat us at the Three10 bar... we had a 5 year old, a 4 year old and and a toddler with us. Not only was this kind of inappropriate, the seating would have made it impossible with a toddler. Then, they attempted to seat us at a large, high-top table. I pointed out that if one of the children fell, it would be a disaster, and the hostess ignored me. It took my sister-in-law having to bluntly explain that we couldn't sit there before we were offered a booth and eventually a booster seat. \n\nOur server was absolutely new and didn't really want to be there, and it became obvious that he was ignoring our table, as we would see him making very wide berths and avoiding eye contact with us. We weren't the only people this was happening to and other families were starting to get visibly upset about first being funneled into the more expensive sit-down restaurant, (kids meals are $12 here and were not great) then receiving poor service because eventually the floor manager started making pre-emptive visits to larger tables to make sure things were alright. After waiting 20 minutes for our bill, we eventually just went to the bar to pay, but were told we'd have to wait for our server. While we were trying to just run the card and get out of there, he mentioned that the kids get free dessert... try getting out of there once the kids here that. We got the doughnuts to go, but being \"gourmet\" doughnuts, they took 10 minutes to package up... again, not the most kid-friendly option here. It was a shame after talking up how great The Rec Room had been on previous visits. \n\nAs for the gaming area, it would be nice if they had more high-top tables for adults to leave their empty cups, (or more staff keeping the area clean). I found myself constantly moving empty alcohol glasses from next to the joysticks and such on gaming consoles or picking them up off the ground from next to the games. There always seems to be an abundance of staff walking around, but I don't really know what they do if I'm the one cleaning and keeping the kids safe...", "date": "2018-08-26 04:46:54"}, {"_key": "1025629", "_id": "reviews/1025629", "_rev": "_fNyrz-O--g", "review_id": "PtWXgpwnJ8Q9tE5u6Buk-A", "user_id": "OyMwCrEpUZDtFlEwnQdWIg", "business_id": "1L0ezCVGAFXSo5zMRUJe5g", "stars": 1, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "So we had reservations for 7 but we got there a little early.

Each coming time the experiences were slowly but surely moving from amazing to great, to good, to not so good, to disappointing  and finally the last visit was just plain awful.\nLets talk about this awful one.\nFOOD: varied from very mediocre to tasteless and in case of beet soup (which was bland as baby food) and sweetbreads appetizer (which they probably forgot even to salt) just uneatable. \nDRINKS: my husband's cocktail was just OK, my Riesling was expansive and awful (with the weird aftertaste) + was ordered a 5 oz glass but what was received was 3 oz the max. Though we didn't fuss about it because after tasting it would be hard to prove the exact quantity poured before tasting and besides who needs more of unpleasant wine in anyway. \nSERVICE: The wait for the 1st course was 40 minutes after ordering, 2nd course wait was 20 minutes after we requested to talk to a manager and sent back these tasteless dishes it took 15 minutes to correct them and bring it back, between the second try was finished and the main course arrived took another 10 minutes, and we didn't even want to order desserts because it was time for us to take our medications and we had to head to the hotel. Yes, they were agree about the quality of the food and the slowest service we ever experienced, explaining that they were very busy (at 80% of capacity the most?!?! at the time of our visit). Yes they were \"apologetic\" about it and \"even\" brought a bread basket (which BTW was the only highlight of our dinner) and took some of the dishes off the check, but the evening was ruined in anyway and nothing was said to really convince us in their sincerity. BTW we observed the other tables while waiting for our food and noticed that the ONLY two tables which were served poorly were the tables served by our waitress. All the other tables were receiving at least timely service. So when we were leaving and passing by this 7 people party table (celebrating some event) they all were in total agreement with us and expressed it quite clear praising us for speaking out.

I ordered the pulled pork platter with two sides and the popover. The pork on my plate had an extremely large amount of fat and really disgusting dark slimy stuff in it. I separated it on my plate from the good part and over half inedible gristle/fat.  I have ordered this same meal three times before with no issue.  The macaroni and cheese was delicious as always and the special of the day gumbo was very good as well.  The popover was much smaller than what I had received in the past, lets just say it had already popped before it made it to me.   It was small and squished together like they had a hard time getting it out of the pan.  Which was disappointing as the only reason I ordered the plater over a sandwich for lunch was for the popover.   This meal I had today was certainly not worth the $14.95 due to lack of edible pork and disappointing popover. When the waiter cleared the plates from the table I asked if it typically had that much fat (although I knew mine before did not).  He glanced down at my plate and said yes, then he took a double take and said, well, usually not that much and then proceeded to leave us the check.  Really???  You saw how gross my food was and you did not even offer anything or apologize?  It was my birthday meal, I chose the restaurant we went to after church.  Since it was my birthday I was really looking forward to a good meal, not this disappointment.  My two regrets... I wish I had taken a picture of it and I also wish I would have sent it back once I had separated the good from the bad.   Like I said, it was my Birthday and I wanted us all to have a good experience so I was trying not to complain during the meal or to the waiter.  Was just super disappointed at his response when he saw how bad my meal was.  My husband ordered the pull pork sandwich and his was fine.  My father-in-law ordered the prime sandwich and really enjoyed it.  As I mentioned earlier I have eaten here before without issues, hoping this was a once off bad experience.

Additionally the staff will talk trash about you while you're in the waiting room but at least they're nice enough to do so loud enough so you can hear. Also make sure you bring your car cleaning supplies because they'll leave dirty, greasy hand prints ALL over the interior and exterior of your car. \n\nMy car needed it's alternator replaced which should have cost at most with parts + labor $400 and that's being generous. They charged me $350 for the part (which malfunctioned as soon as I left the parking lot), another $150 to install it, $150 for a battery (I more than likely didn't need), and $30 to install the battery, plus $20 just to look at my car when I told them what was wrong. But me being a female, what do I know about cars?? When I mentioned that the price was a little outrageous they laughed and kept saying I should call around for quotes. Well I did and 3 LOCALLY owned and operated shops all quoted me $350... HALF OF WHAT I PAID AT TUFFY'S. \n\nSo I've now paid them $700 for a faulty part that is causing the battery light to go off intermittently while I'm driving. I called the store that was much closer to where I live but was told 'even though it's a national warranty if the stores are within 50 miles of each other you have to go back to the original location'. So the only option I had was to return to the scene of the crime and be forced to face the disrespectful staff one more time... No thank you.

It is about an hour outside of Philly and the price has always been a little steep, so it isn't somewhere we would frequent. \n\nAnyways, my review is for my latest dining experience there this past weekend. My memories of this place are much better than the reality. The rice on the sushi was extremely mushy, like get-stuck-in-your-teeth-and-can't-get-it-out mushy. The overall taste was good, but not great. \nHowever, I did really enjoy their small pieces of sashimi (besides the red snapper-- not good) and noticed that they put significantly less rice on their sushi. People tend to only eat the fish or fillings in their rolls, so they wouldn't get full as fast. But, they threaten to charge if you do not eat the rice. \n\nThe Snow Crab legs are not heated up for some reason, which I thought was strange. Some pieces were SUPER salty to the point of almost being inedible. There wasn't any butter at the buffet, so we asked our server, and the butter was so gross!!! It tasted like watered down butter or just really cheap margarine. \n\nThe best part of my meal was probably the Udon noodle soup by the hibachi grill and the matcha soft serve ice cream. They were delicious and I could probably eat bowls and bowls of each. But is noodle soup and ice cream worth the $36 per person price tag? Not really. \n\nSave your money and drive to New Jersey for their AYCE sushi joints, which taste much better and are made to order.

I looked at my nails before I left explaining that the white was uneven and the acrylic had dips in it in my nail bed, they just were horribly crafted from the start. I said I would be back after my meeting because the owner apologized and asked to fix them for me for free, but still asked me to pay $18 before I left anyway. Why am I paying 18$?! The ONLY reason I paid it without just walking out is because my friend was still there as I was leaving and I didn't want to make her feel uncomfortable while finishing hers. I was cut and burned the entire time while the owner kept allowing it to continue. They weren't done properly. Anyway, so I come back, and I end up waiting 30minutes before the owner can even start on my nails. She apologizes the entire time as I'm looking at the same lady work on pedicures. Finally my nails are finished and they look so much better! 2days later my thumb chips badly, I call and go back & she fixes it but seems aggravated about doing it. I have no idea why she( the owner ) would be aggravated, because here I was giving her yet another chance to redeem herself and prove she was a great business owner and could take care of her customers. But no. Again this is gel, it should not be chipping in 2days. Two days after that visit they chip again, I call in and speak with the daughter of the owner and recant my encounters and she apologizes and asks me to come in that she would repair the chips for free, and I come in and she was very pleasant. Three days later they chipped again. Gel. Never going back. I ended up wasting over 4hours & 3 different days of my time at this salon for one shotty manicure. Epic nightmare. No wonder they barely had anyone there my three visits. I will never be back. I could've became a regular, every 2-week  customer as I was looking for a regular nail salon since my salon of 6 years was closed and sold to different owners in Baton Rouge.", "date": "2018-04-18 06:45:48"}, {"_key": "1032192", "_id": "reviews/1032192", "_rev": "_fNyrzMO--U", "review_id": "V7uQXrzNz9SrWy8_wLneuA", "user_id": "kNx7HN_CRbnxpLocYbIGKw", "business_id": "EIZqu00QKPjOxoQCGFJglg", "stars": 1, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Three words....\nOld\nCold\nBland\n\n\nShowing  every bit of its 40 years of age (and not in a good way) salad bar looks like its a relic from the 70's, tired concept, it makes Outback Steakhouse look exciting!", "date": "2018-03-08 05:55:12"}, {"_key": "1032225", "_id": "reviews/1032225", "_rev": "_fNyrzMS--V", "review_id": "oxTFfOj1k5GlayxCs2pKrg", "user_id": "rdKbxTMQzwmzRF6-rZ_xvA", "business_id": "Z_xbp4N5MDssZxdUohybTg", "stars": 2, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Be prepared to wait around and spend A LOT of money!!

What was unexpected was how all these country line dancers would act so unwelcoming in the least and, at the most extreme, would turn to assault in order to encourage others to either get in line or get off the dance floor. \n\nI was offered no refund, and in the end, was asked to leave the bar.

After being detained and even briefly handcuffed she was fortunate enough to be allowed to leave but was followed home by the female officer and told not to drive her car until she notified dealership of the problem.  When she called the dealership and spoke with a manager  (I need to get his name again) he acted as though it was no big deal - just an honest mistake.  No apology was given but was told to stop by and they would give her a different temporary tag which hopefully would reflect her as the owner.  \nThis was actually the 3rd vehicle we have bought for her from this dealership but I can tell you this has made me very unhappy.", "date": "2018-01-13 00:29:51"}, {"_key": "1035087", "_id": "reviews/1035087", "_rev": "_fNyrzUO--Y", "review_id": "1rlIc3NxA8vkBluAfGUGxQ", "user_id": "lDjl_C3p1rn84LPsynBTsA", "business_id": "mMKfNTiHHzZe7eAwJcX9ng", "stars": 1, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "If I could put no stars then I would because it's called fast food for a reason.

They sent the maintenance guy who is nice but full of excuses. He tells us that in shipping one of the lights were broken in the wall unit and it's not going to come on.

We are supposedly in a newly renovated two room suite. We had the door to the room closed. When we opened it we were hit with a sewage smell that wasn't there before. I thought maybe because we didn't have the fan on the smell was caused by poor circulation. I turned the fan on and cut it off 10 minutes later. The smell returned. It wasn't in the bathroom it was in the bedroom. I called the front desk who in turn sends maintenance. His first remark was this is the only room he has had to come to all night. Mind you the hotel is far from full evident by the empty parking lot which almost made us want to go somewhere else but it was too late to cancel. Then he goes on to say he doesn't smell anything and maybe it's the baby. My son has not had a BM since we have been here and we wouldn't call the desk if we thought that's what it is. He rambled off a couple more excuses and told us to call the front desk if we wanted to move rooms. I called the front desk to let them know the type of response we received. She offered a $75 credit which I declined because that was not the purpose of my complaint. In summary, I guess you get what you paid for.

THIS PLACE TAKES YOUR MONEY AND RUINS  CLOTHES!   \nI was told by the owner, Jennifer, that she would give me a special discount on the cleaning of my work dresses... This SUPPOSED special allowed me to have them dry clean my dresses for $20 a piece.   $20 a piece is a discount?   I am used to paying $13 in the area I lived (about 1/2 hour away).\nHowever, out of proximity to my boyfriend's house and my work I decided to pay this exhorbidant fee.   I brought in 4 work dresses and paid the $80 I agreed to.  \nI took them home and removed the plastic wrap and hung them up.  Several minutes late I went to pull out one of the dresses to set it aside to wear it.    I smelled the arm pits of x3 of the dresses and it smelled exactly like stagnant water and body odor! That means that they either did not clean my dresses at all and just IRONED the diet and body odor into them or else they are using rotten water and either no or poor chemicals that don't work to remove the stains and odor.   \nAren't you supposed to check an item for odor before you iron it in permanently?    \nI also have to say that I am so angered by my most recent event....not only did I encounter the above non-laundered but charged for dresses....but I also had asked this business to simply PRESS a dress I had dropped off a few days ago.  I told the worker that I had already cleaned the dress and just needed a quick press. She would not quote me price for the ironing.   I reminded her that past laundries have only charged me $5 or so to simply iron an item.     She ended up saying that she would ask the owner (Jennifer) about the cost of the ironing and then would phone me with a price quote by this Thursday.  I didn't receive a call on Thursday.   So, I went to pick up my dress and get it back.   Jennifer was there and told me that they had already pressed it!    I reminded her that they mentioned I was supposed to get a call with the price quote before they had my permission. She made no apology.    She just kept saying that she would give me a good price on the iron job because I come from far away.  Then she charged me $15!!!!      At least I know the dress is clean because I personally had washed it at home before dropping it off!

That's fine, the mini labs take time. I was the only one there because it was Saturday morning. They prescribed an antibiotic while they waited for my labs to come back. \nSunday I became extremely ill and on Monday even more so. Called them Monday morning, my voice cracking from the fatigue and asked about the results of my lab. I let the man know that I've become extremely ill. Let him know that my medication wasn't effective and needed a different one. He said labs were back but the doctor needed to approve the change in medication. So I went somewhere else and they told me the bacteria was spreading to my kidneys. They prescribed a different medication immediately. Total Access Urgent Care called the following day and said, \"Your medication has a resistance to your string of infection\". Yeah, no shit. \nSo, in a nutshell I was almost hospitalized due to TOTAL ACCESS URGENT CARE. I wrote them a letter expressing my dissatisfaction to their services. Thanks for the apology for your gross negligence. Also, thank you for billing me. Most of which my insurance has paid. The fact that they'd have the audacity to bill me is absolutely baffling.

I was also only offered lettuce, tomato, and/or onion, which confused me since there were several more veggies listed on a board on the wall. I asked for a little spicy mustard and went down the line. I was glad my sub was free because the prices are higher than any other sub place I've ever been to. I love pasta salad so I decided to add it on, $2 for a side. Customer service was pretty good but the cashier was so confused as to how to enter my coupon. At the drink station, the lemons were molded so I skipped adding any of those to my h20. As soon as I sat down, I realized my sub was saturated with sauce. The bread had gotten soggy immediately. I also noticed that the veggies were NOT fresh. I tried just eating the meat out but it was all SO salty that I couldn't deal. I picked some of the bread off (non-soggy parts) and it was pretty good bread. The pasta salad was downright gross, way too much dressing that was overbearingly sweet, like someone poured sugar in.

It is the Valentine's day dinner and I don't want to ruin it in front of my girls. I asked for the check, only to find out that the waiter did not take out the salads we asked him to skip, and Fish of the day costs $40+. Even my teenager daughter realized it's a rip off.

I signed up for their X1 DVR TV service and their internet service. After the install was complete the technician showed me a line of cable outside along my driveway. It went from the sidewalk up my driveway to the side of my house. He said he couldn't put it in the pipe because the pipe was clogged. He said he would have someone come back out to fix the pipe and run the line in it with in a few days to maybe a week. A few weeks went by so I finally called to find out when they would be back out to fix it. When I called they knew nothing about it. They set up a technician to come out and check it out. Then they set up for another guy to come back and put the line underground. The guy came out and when he left after doing the job I noticed he opened up a hole in the skirting that goes around my house and did not close or fix it. So I had to have them back out again to fix it.\n\nThen I started having problems with the picture freezing and not being able to pause or rewind 3 out of 4 of the TV's in my house. I called in to have a technician come back out to fix it. I have had to do this from November of 2017 to now August of 2018. Multiple technicians every month for the past 9 months. All of them different and all of them saying \"Wow I've never seen it do that before\" and \"Let me go back to my office and talk to someone and I'll get back to you\". Then I would not hear back from them. They even gave me their supervisors cell phone number and asked me to call him instead of the comcast 800 number because it would go against the last technician that was at my house if I call the 800 number. I would first call the supervisors number and always leave a message. After a week or more and not getting a call back from the supervisor I would end up having to call the 800 number. They would set up another appointment for another technician to come out. The same thing would happen. So then I filed a complaint with the CPUC. I received a call the very next day from a lady in the Comcast Executive Customer Relations Department. She had me explain the issues I was having and also said to me \"I should not be having those issues, that her boxes work correctly so mine should as well\". She assured me that she would get this problem solved.\n\nNow this brings me to today. After me calling and leaving multiple voice messages and me sending multiple emails and getting no response back over the past three weeks. I filed a complaint with the FCC. Today I get a call from the lady and she leaves me a voice mail saying \"As stated before by all the technicians that have been to my house and by her. There is nothing wrong with my services they are working the way they should. The technicians have explained how they work to me and they will no long be sending out any more technician out to my house for this issue\".\n\nSo basically they don't know how to fix the problem or they do know how but they don't want to pay to fix the problem. They advertise \"you can pause and rewind live TV in any room.\" I can only do this in 1 of 4 rooms. I call this false advertisement and believe they should be held accountable. I will be looking into a class action law suit against them. I'm also going to be contacting the local news stations like ABC, CBS, NBC. I'm tired of companies getting away with saying they can provide you with a service then it not being what they said it would be.\n\nYes I could cancel my service with them but I can't get dish or direct TV service where I am.

It appeared to be a clean room but late at night we found out otherwise..... as we were watching TV,  we saw a roach on the wall..... after killing SEVEN roaches and two other bugs we decided to rather sleep in our car that night. Having wake up from a restless sleep and uncomfortable experience we talking to a manager the next AM. She was very friendly and understanding but what I thought was just not reasonable at all was the fact we got charge for the night that we didn't even sleep at. She didn't charge us for the other nights we were supposed to stay but after paying 139$ a night and only getting 30$ off for a place we didn't even sleep at was just nonsense to me. I and think anyone, would expect a full refund. All we did was shower at the inn. That's it!

Being that we were visiting out of town, we had a couple of questions about the menu choices. She proceeded to explain, and I use that word lightly, what the burritos contained all while looking down at the screen of her phone. What great service *sarcasm intended*.\nOur food actually tasted quite nasty, was bland, and was cold. The food tasted as if they hadn't changed the oil in their fryer in a while! Carne asada fries, chips, and rolled tacos tasted of rancid oil; not to mention that the carne asada was over cooked. Cheese in the quesadilla was nothing but cheddar cheese; definitely not authentic and extremely greasy.\nBe ready to leave the establishment smelling like rancid oil, or as some say in Spanish \"fritanga\". \nSave your time and money and go elsewhere where the service is better and the food is tastier.
