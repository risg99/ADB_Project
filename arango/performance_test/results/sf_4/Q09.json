They use only Louisiana oysters and because of the oil spill in the Gulf, they cannot serve any dishes with oysters.  Boo.\n\nI subbed in a fish (catfish, I assume) po' boy instead and it was delectable.  It had catfish, shredded lettuce, slices of tomato, mayo, and pickles, inside a loaf of French bread.

Both businesses are located in Pie Town, a neighborhood on the southern edge of downtown Nashville. There's not a whole lot of stuff in this part of town. These are definitely two of the highlights.\n\nTennessee Brew Works opened on August 18, 2013. It's popular. This place has won numerous awards and earned plenty of recognition including the best brewery in Tennessee according to Yelp. These folks are all about being local, green, and sustainable. The taproom is two stories with views of the brewery from both floors. There's a patio with both covered and uncovered spaces (mostly uncovered) as well as a small, string-lit rooftop patio. As this is a brewery, the property has an industrial, warehouse feel to it, much like the other businesses in Pie Town. It's clean and modernized. The first floor of the brewery features a small stage for live music (a band was setting up on our way out) and the room upstairs, which is much more spacious, has TVs playing sports and nice overhead views of the brewery floor below.\n\nBrewery tours take place every Saturday at 3pm, 4pm, and 5pm. It costs $10 plus tax and a fee per person. Tickets for the tour can be purchased online.\n\nAlong with high-quality craft beer, the brewery also serves food. Their limited menu includes apps/snacks like Baja fish tacos, Springer Mountain chicken wings, salads, burgers, and sandwiches (including a Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich). Food prices range from $8 to $18 per plate.\n\nWe grabbed a few beers and hung out inside the taproom downstairs. Downstairs, they use barrels (some with tabletops) for tables with bar stools. We showed up around 2pm on a Saturday and the place was busy. It wasn't slammed or jam-packed, but most of the tables upstairs and downstairs were taken. Our group of six was lucky to find a table in a corner next to some brewery windows. The atmosphere was very relaxed and laid back. The staff was cool and friendly. We all enjoyed our time here.\n\nI don't think Tennessee Brew Works has dedicated parking. We parked for free on the street (Middleton Street because we also went to Third Man Records).

It's managed by the city's Parks & Rec department. This is a great sightseeing spot in Philly. I recommend it. The views are beautiful.\n\nSome quick Q&A:\n\n1. Why is it called Logan Circle?\n\nBecause it serves as a major traffic circle for Benjamin Franklin Parkway (https://www.yelp.com/biz/ben-franklin-parkway-philadelphia), connecting it to North 19th Street, Vine Street, and Race Street.\n\n2. Why is it called Logan Square?\n\nBecause it was one of five squares originally planned for the city in 1864 by William Penn, founder of Pennsylvania.\n\n3. Who is the circle/square named after?\n\nJames Logan, 14th mayor of Philadelphia.\n\nLogan Circle is actually surrounded by three other parks: Aviator Park, Sister Cities Park, and Shakespeare Park (small). Combined, the land area for these four parks, including the roads (Benjamin Franklin Parkway is wide and scenic) is about four city blocks. So for a city park, it's not huge, but not small neither.\n\nThe highlight of Logan Circle is a large fountain in the center called the Swann Memorial Fountain: https://www.yelp.com/biz/swann-memorial-fountain-philadelphia-2. We visited on a bright and sunny Sunday afternoon and the park was filled with people, both locals and tourists. Even though there were signs that said no swimming in the fountain, I can't tell you how many kids I saw swimming and playing in the fountain. A lot. It almost looked more like a pool or water park than a historic fountain.\n\nLogan Circle is centrally-located between Philadelphia City Hall and the Philadelphia Museum of Art (Rocky Steps: https://www.yelp.com/biz/rocky-steps-philadelphia). Benjamin Franklin Parkway connects all of it. If you've never been to Philly before and want to sight-see, I think walking the parkway between city hall and the museum is a must. Including the aforementioned adjacent parks, Logan Circle is surrounded by sights and attractions including the Franklin Institute, the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University, and the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul.\n\nNote: At the time of writing this review, there's another Yelp listing for Logan Circle. It's called Logan Square Park: https://www.yelp.com/biz/logan-square-park-philadelphia.

I purchased my old Google Pixel phone from the Google Store (online). One of the options I could add to my phone was Device Protection for $99. Device protection is the same thing as phone insurance and Assurant was the provider.\n\nThe coverage I purchased was good for two years from the date I received my phone. The maximum number of accidental damage repairs or replacements under Device Protection was two during the coverage period. My Pixel's camera lenses, both front and back, got scratched. The scratches caused light streaks in my photos and videos so I decided to file a claim and get a replacement.\n\nPer the Device Protection welcome and terms and conditions email I got from Assurant, I filed my claim at https://mydeviceprotect.com/. It was really quick and easy to do, especially since Assurant had most of my information on file from my phone's IMEI/serial number. I filed my claim on a Friday night. In less than 24 hours, someone from Assurant called to verify my information and approve my claim. I received a claim approval email after the call and a shipping notification that Monday (first business day after my claim was approved). I received my replacement Pixel on Tuesday afternoon; basically, in two business days. Fast!\n\nI did have to pay a $79 deductible, but it was totally worth it to me. It was like I got a brand new Pixel for only $178 ($99 for Device Protection + $79 deductible). Technically, the phone was refurbished, but it looked and worked like new - the battery too, which was huge, since my old battery was on its way out. Considering my particular phone model at the time, a 32-GB Pixel 1, originally retailed for $649, I thought this was a good deal. Plus, I had one more replacement remaining on my contract before my two years were up. It was nice to have that peace of mind.\n\nGoogle made it easy to transfer all of my apps and data from my old Pixel to my new Pixel. I just connected the two phones with a USB-C cable and followed the prompts. The entire transfer took about an hour (my new Pixel had to download and install almost 100 apps). I was really pleased with how simple and seamless the transition was. My old phone was essentially mirrored to my new one which was exactly what I wanted. I did have to set up new fingerprint recognition and log in to all of my apps again, but that was it. I was back up and running with a \"new\" phone with hardly any interruption.\n\nI returned my old Pixel in the same packaging that my new Pixel came in. Assurant emailed me a shipping label to print and tape to the outside of the box. I had to return my old Pixel within 14 days from the date my new Pixel was shipped. Otherwise, I could've been charged an \"unrecovered equipment fee\" of up to $2,000.\n\nIn the end, I am very happy with the Device Protection I purchased from Assurant. I already bought it again for my latest phone, the Pixel 3, for $129 (unsurprisingly, the insurance price went up).", "date": "2019-02-03 16:24:22"}, {"_key": "679931", "_id": "reviews/679931", "_rev": "_fNysUCq--h", "review_id": "xNTO7hUoAIx9I2uL0s8K-g", "user_id": "j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "business_id": "pCmaISSyKum22MOtPOxL-w", "stars": 3, "useful": 10, "funny": 3, "cool": 8, "text": "The Philadelphia Phillies are one of the oldest American professional sports franchises, established in 1883. Unlike other storied teams, the Fightin' Phils have never left their original city.\n\nIt took nearly 100 years, but the Phillies were able to win their first World Series championship in 1980 and then again, 28 years later, in 2008. In 1980, future Hall-of-Famer and perhaps the greatest third baseman of all time, Mike Schmidt, led Philadelphia to a 4-2 series win over the Kansas City Royals. In 2008, four-time All-Star pitcher Cole Hamels led Philly in a dominating series performance over the Tampa Bay Rays, 4-1. (Since 2020, Hamels has played for my favorite team, the Atlanta Braves.)\n\nThe Phillies play at Citizens Bank Park, located in South Philly. The ballpark opened in 2004 and is part of the South Philadelphia Sports Complex which includes the adjacent Lincoln Financial Field (home of the NFL's Philadelphia Eagles) and Wells Fargo Center (home of the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers). You can see the complex from the interstate (I-95) as you drive into the city from the airport. It's just across the Delaware River from New Jersey.\n\nThe Phillies haven't done well since 2011, the last year they made the playoffs. From 2012 to present, they've yet to finish a single season above .500 (they finished at exactly .500 twice, in 2012 and 2019), a far cry from their 2008 championship. However, the Charlie Manuel (manager) years (2005-2013), immediately preceding the current playoff drought, comprise a great era in Philadelphia's baseball history. Under Manuel, the Phillies made the playoffs five straight seasons (including that '08 World Series title), had first baseman Ryan Howard named NL Rookie of the Year in 2005 and then NL MVP the following year in 2006, shortstop Jimmy Rollins named NL MVP in 2007, and pitcher Roy Halladay named NL Cy Young Award winner in 2010. Unfortunately, the team hasn't been the same since Manuel's firing during the 2013 season.\n\nAt the time of writing this review, the Phillies have an all-time win percentage of .472 (9,853 wins against 11,032 losses).", "date": "2021-02-12 20:10:07"}, {"_key": "747073", "_id": "reviews/747073", "_rev": "_fNysV9W--V", "review_id": "Ez_VZ6uSsna2r9tGKbWbKA", "user_id": "j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "business_id": "TgbI5_wXWa82NBVwkvC0yQ", "stars": 4, "useful": 5, "funny": 1, "cool": 3, "text": "We stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott Philadelphia Plymouth Meeting and really enjoyed our stay. Everyone at the hotel seemed nice, especially Kim, the lady who checked us in. Kim set the tone and was really welcoming and affable. The hotel and amenities were nice considering the tier of hotel and price paid. We were part of a wedding block and were charged $119.90 per night after taxes. Not bad.\n\nIf you're not familiar with Philadelphia, this hotel is located in the suburbs northwest of town. There's plenty of free parking and the hotel is located within walking distance of a big shopping mall, Plymouth Meeting Mall, that is anchored in part by a Whole Foods. Aside from the mall, if you don't have a car, you're going to have to Lyft/Uber to get anywhere.\n\nThis Courtyard by Marriott is four stories. Our room was 335 on the 3rd floor. It was a \"KSOF\" (king with sofa bed) room with a view of the parking lot and office building to the north. The hotel is surrounded by several office buildings so I suspect a lot of business travelers stay here to work at those buildings.\n\nFrom the outside, the hotel looks like your standard Courtyard by Marriott. Inside, it looks like some renovation work has been done. The place was clean and looked fairly modern. While there's no full-service restaurant or shop, there is a fast-casual counter where you can order made-to-order food and drinks, a small retail corner with grab-and-go items, some dining and lounge-like areas, and a business center of sorts. There's also an indoor pool, hot tub, and gym. The gym is tiny. Outside in the back is a little courtyard with nice landscaping and additional seating. It's worth exploring and checking out.\n\nWhen we checked in, Kim handed us two bottles of water and two Peanut Chews, delicious candy bars that are manufactured in Pennsylvania.\n\nOur room was clean and comfy, and contemporary in design. The toiletries, such as the shampoo, conditioner, and body wash, were Paul Mitchell Tea Tree brand. The bathroom had a standard tub and shower with a floor that was tastefully tiled. The bed was very comfortable, from the soft-yet-firm mattress to the silky-smooth and smell-good sheets. There was an artsy-looking couch (sofa bed) with a conveniently-angled end table. The office desk was extendable which was great for more surface space. The TV was a smart TV with apps like Netflix and YouTube installed. There was a coffee maker, iron and ironing board, luggage rack, and hair dryer. The Wi-Fi was free and fast enough. And there was free, self-serve, tasty coffee and fruit-flavored ice water in the lobby.\n\nStandard check-in time is 3pm and check-out is 12pm. I used the Marriott Bonvoy app to keep track of my reservation and make an early check-in (12pm) request. The hotel (Kim) was quick to respond to my chat messages in the app and she remembered me from our chat conversation when I showed up in person to check-in. I like how they stay on top of that. Saturday night, when the lobby was used for the wedding after-party, I called in a request for additional toiletries and housekeeping was reasonably quick to respond despite the craziness going on downstairs. I appreciated that.\n\nOverall, I think this is a very good mid-tier hotel.

The Flyers won back-to-back Stanley Cups in 1974 and 1975. The team's number of championships (2) is tied for 11th best in the league. Historically, the Flyers have been a perennial playoff team. All time, the team ranks in the top 10 in total playoff seasons. However, over the last decade, the Flyers have only made the playoffs on average about every other year. All things considered, Philadelphia has been home to one of the NHL's better-performing franchises.\n\nThe Flyers are among the NHL's second-oldest members. They were part of the second wave of franchises that joined during the league's 1967 expansion. That expansion saw the league size double from six teams (the Original Six) to 12 teams. Of the 1967 expansion teams, Philadelphia was the first to win the Stanley Cup. Another 1967 expansion team, the in-state rival Pittsburgh Penguins, have won the Stanley Cup five times (the most of any of the expansion teams from that year). After winning back-to-back titles in 1974 and 1975, the Flyers went on to appear in six more Stanley Cup Finals, the latest in 2010.\n\nFour of the Flyers' six retired jersey numbers belong to players who won the Stanley Cup. They include goaltender Bernie Parent, defenseman Barry Ashbee, left-winger Bill Barber, and center Bobby Clarke. Parent is a legend among goalies and a Philadelphia sports icon. Clarke was the captain of both teams that won the Stanley Cup. Parent, Barber, and Clarke were all inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. Ashbee was a member of the 1974 championship team, but his career was unfortunately cut short from an eye injury he suffered in the Flyers' series preceding the Stanley Cup Finals. Tragically, only about three years later, Ashbee passed away from leukemia at age 37.\n\nThe Flyers' home arena is the Wells Fargo Center. With a present seating capacity of 19,600 (the number can vary depending on where you look; 19,600 is from the Wells Fargo Center website), the Wells Fargo Center is the fourth-biggest arena in the NHL. The Flyers and the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers have been the building's only two full-time occupants since the building opened in 1996. The seating capacity for Sixers games is slightly larger at 21,000. Wells Fargo Center is part of the South Philadelphia Sports Complex which includes Lincoln Financial Field (Philadelphia Eagles; NFL) and Citizens Bank Park (Philadelphia Phillies; MLB).\n\n#AnytimeAnywhere", "date": "2021-07-28 13:55:17"}, {"_key": "824251", "_id": "reviews/824251", "_rev": "_fNysYgy--H", "review_id": "YOp7ftuc3Biiuj4I9n9Mgg", "user_id": "j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "business_id": "Jio1vxVDY7qzNR5tVQj2lQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 6, "funny": 1, "cool": 5, "text": "I'm rating the Edmonton Oilers five stars based on their dominance from 1983 to 1990. Sadly, Edmonton has only made the playoffs twice since losing to the Carolina Hurricanes in a heartbreaking Game 7 in the 2006 Stanley Cup Finals. However, their history in the 80s cannot be denied. The Oilers won the Cup five times in seven years: 1984, 1985, 1987, 1988, and 1990. To date, the Oilers are tied with the Pittsburgh Penguins for the sixth-most number of Stanley Cup championships. The Oilers and the Penguins have the most NHL titles outside of the Original Six. A finer point, the Oilers franchise did not join the NHL until 1979 while the Penguins were part of the league's 1967 expansion. It's impressive how many championships Edmonton racked up after being a member of the NHL for only about a decade.\n\n\"The Great One\" Wayne Gretzky, started his NHL career with Edmonton. He is the franchise's all-time scoring leader in both goals (583) and points (1,669). Unlike many of the great hockey players today, Gretzky was not drafted. He played in the now-defunct World Hockey Association (WHA) for Edmonton for one season before the WHA folded. After that, the Oilers joined the NHL and the rest is history. Gretzky won all four of his Stanley Cups with Edmonton. He left the team in 1988 when he was traded by the Oilers to the Los Angeles Kings. The Oilers would go on to win the following Stanley Cup without him and Gretzky would never win another Cup again.\n\nToday, Connor McDavid is the Oilers' best player. He's currently considered one of the best players in hockey. Edmonton drafted him with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft. Already, McDavid has won the Hart Memorial Trophy (NHL regular season MVP in 2017; Gretzky won the Hart Trophy nine times), the Ted Lindsay Award twice (NHL regular season most outstanding player in 2017 and 2018), and the Art Ross Trophy twice (NHL regular season most points in 2017 and 2018). He was also on the cover of EA Sports NHL 18. He's quickly climbing up in the franchise record books.\n\nThe Oilers' current home is Rogers Place, located in downtown Edmonton. Opened in 2016, Rogers Place is one of the NHL's newest arenas. It has over 1,250 TV screens and the largest HD center ice scoreboard in the league. For hockey, Rogers Place has a seating capacity of 18,347. The Edmonton Oil Kings of the Western Hockey League (WHL) have also called Rogers Place home since 2016.

It's located just one block away from Philadelphia City Hall and is adjacent to the very popular Reading Terminal Market, so it's convenient to other must-see spots in the city.\n\nBy my count, Chinatown takes up about 21 city blocks. The Pennsylvania Convention Center takes up roughly a quarter of the neighborhood. Like other Chinatowns in big American cities, Philly's Chinatown is relatively old and densely-packed. Food is a big draw, of course, with restaurants serving not only Chinese food like dim sum and Peking duck, but also Japanese ramen and yakitori, Korean fried chicken, Malaysian, Thai, and Vietnamese cuisine, and vegetarian food. There are also Asian bakeries and bubble tea galore.\n\nThe official entrance to Chinatown is located on the south side of the neighborhood on N 10th St at Arch St. The gate is known as the Friendship Gate or Friendship Arch (https://www.yelp.com/biz/chinatown-friendship-gate-philadelphia). It's a vehicular gate and, ironically, traffic flows only one-way: out of Chinatown. N 10th St is also home to the Chinese Cultural & Community Center as well as the Mandarin-language campus of the Chinese Christian Church & Center (https://www.yelp.com/biz/chinese-christian-church-and-center-philadelphia-2).\n\nI attended a wedding at the church's Vine Campus which is less than a five-minute walk away. Vine St forms Chinatown's north border with N Broad St to the west, N 7th St to the east, and Arch St to the south. The neighborhood immediately north of Chinatown, Callowhill, is referred to by many as Chinatown North. The Asian Arts Initiative, a non-profit community and arts center, is located there (https://www.yelp.com/biz/asian-arts-initiative-philadelphia).\n\nIf you want to sight-see and explore Chinatown, N 10th St at Race St is a good place to start.

This is my first review of a gate.\n\nThe Chinatown Friendship Gate, also known as the Chinatown Friendship Arch and the China Gate, is the \"official\" entrance to Philadelphia's Chinatown. The gate is located on N 10th St at Arch St. It's 40 feet tall and weighs 88 tons. It's called the Friendship Gate because it symbolizes the friendship between Philly and its sister city in China, Tianjin. The gate officially \"opened\" (was dedicated) in January 1984 with a rededication in 2008.\n\nThis is a neat landmark and worth checking out if you've never been to Philly Chinatown before.

I think Philly's Chinatown gate trumps San Francisco's Chinatown gate, Dragon Gate (http://bit.ly/2Yy21uu), in terms of size and decor, but SF's gate is actually three gates in one (two gates for pedestrians and one for vehicles). This gate is built over vehicular traffic only: two one-way car lanes and one one-way bike lane, all heading south out of Chinatown and into Center City.\n\nIf you're visiting Philly from out of town, I recommend going to Tea Do (http://bit.ly/2M9XSWV) one block north of the gate and Reading Terminal Market (http://bit.ly/2OOoUFG) two blocks east.\n\nAfter leaving a review for this gate, I realized I never left one for the SF version (http://bit.ly/2Yy21uu).

At $16.95 for one dozen, it may not have been worth it.\n\nWe also tried to order raw oysters of which they had none.  Our server tried to explain to us why they did not have raw oysters and all we could surmise from his explanation was that there were not a sufficient number of oyster boats due to the BP oil spill, but he also mentioned something about a one-hour refrigeration time, so it left us a bit confused.  Oh well.  No raw oysters = bad.\n\nDrago's serves higher-end Creole cuisine and also specializes in a variety of lobster dishes.  The restaurant is located at the ground level of the Hilton.

Without really explaining why, she walks away, but only to come back with both of our selections in a boot! Super! Except that my beer was warm...and later cost me $19.50!!!!! She explained that they didn't have a way to charge me for the boot (um, hello, why do you even have them then?) so she just charged me for 3 beers. Based on a general rule of thumb, whenever there are, let's say, 3 different sizes of things, each one costs more, yes, BUT you've got to save a little for going with the larger size. Think of it as if you were ordering a large drink over a medium one at a movie theater (\"for only a quarter more...\"). My friend's beer, $11...exactly what that boot should cost.\n\nFood: My friend ordered the Wurst plate ($16) and I went with the Rouladen ($20). The wurst came out cold. Cold! As for the Rouladen, I should've ordered the Wiener Schnitzel.\n\nThe most redeeming part of last night's dinner were the potato pancakes ($6)...not because they were amazing (they're just potato pancakes), but because they were still warm when they hit our table. \n\nOur grand total came to $78.49.

At first, I thought someone had died, then, the moment she and I made eye contact, I knew this had everything to do with me. \n\nI freaked out because I had 3 final papers on the computer - they were due the following day. Thankfully, I receive an email from a distant friend who said he got a call from a cab driver who found his number in my laptop bag and wanted to get in touch with me. My friend got the cabbie's info and with that, I called.\n\nThe cabbie informed me that yes, he had my laptop, but no, he wasn't going to give it up that easily. What was I willing to pay for it? I was outraged! I headed directly to my campus police office and told them what was going to happen. \n\nI set up a sting operation. \n\nI called the cabbie back and agreed to meet up with him at The Fresh Grocer to exchange $900 for the laptop. The campus detectives geared up in their street clothes and we all walked over. My friend and I sat upstairs in the dining area overlooking Walnut Street. The cab pulled up. The driver got out of the car and hesitatingly made his way across the street towards Fresh Grocer. As he climbed the stairs to meet us, I saw the look of doubt and suspicion in his eyes. With every step I took towards him, he took another step back. Until suddenly, he was quickly backing down the stairs. The policeman (who was nonchalantly examining fruit minutes prior) raced up the stairs and tackled him to the ground. \n\nThe Fresh Grocer didn't know what had hit it. The employees were hooting and hollering. It was the best thing they'd ever seen at work. \n\nSo, disaster averted. The dishonest cabbie worked for Victory. I've sworn them off ever since. Until now, that is. \n\nMy brother left his cell phone in a cab yesterday and flew home to Miami for the summer. My mom called freaking out and asked that I meet up with the cabbie to get his phone back. Based on my previous experience, I expected another fiasco.

It is quite the labyrinth and is easy to get lost despite the signposts peppered throughout, although this often makes for the best exploration. While the hotel isn't located in the heart of downtown Nashville, it isn't a terribly far drive either.\n\nTaking a stroll through the atriums is like being in a tropical oasis. There are multiple waterfalls, streams, and lush foliage. While I have no idea what any of it has to do with Nashville itself or its history, it is quite lovely. The strategically placed oversized guitars feel a bit out of place, and yet seem more authentic to the local flavor. Compared to Gaylord Palms in Orlando which actually has decor centered around Florida (Evergaldes, Key West, and Saint Augustine), I felt less of the connection to the city here. However, I can't deny that the hotel is still quite picturesque. Visit around Christmas, and the entire hotel is bedecked in holly and strings of twinkling lights as well.\n\nLike any major hotel,\u00a0Gaylord Opryland\u00a0\u00a0comes with its pros and cons.

They do have Starbucks on premises if you are short on time, but walk or drive across the street to\u00a0Nashville Coffees\u00a0for a better selection and more interesting options.\n\nIf you are staying on business or at the hotel for a conference, the conference center is massive and quite convenient. There is more than enough space for an exhibition hall and smaller rooms for more intimate talks. WiFi is available throughout the area if you need to sneak away to get work done on your laptop. Speaking of the WiFi, you can also connect throughout the grounds or in the hotel rooms, and they have a direct wired connection if you need something faster, which makes a better choice if you need to connect to a VPN or are on a call.\n\nThe rooms themselves are comfortable, although certainly some sections are better than others.

If that weren't enough to entice, then they add barrel aged versions that add additional complexity from Madeira to Cognac.\n\nMany of the meads take on almost a wine like quality, balancing honey laced sweetness with a biting acidity. For those unfamiliar with meads, or those just wanting to try more of their masterful libations, I highly suggest grabbing a flight. The menu is ever changing, and often includes limited offerings that may not be available otherwise. Each mead is quite distinctive and may range from fairly dry to on par with a Sauternes. They do offer some snacks as well, which can provide balance to an otherwise saccharine tasting.\n\nTruly one of the best meaderies to be found, Garagiste is undoubtedly worth a visit when in Tampa.

Kellie even went out of her way to replace the feta cheese with some additional vegetables like tomatoes and cucumbers. Both were excellent, reasonably priced at $6.00-$7.00 and you could taste the love embedded in each.

I knew that.  Neither was Rotier's.  But my handy Yelp app had assured me that Fido's was open.

Would I really have to wait two more weeks when I would find solace in East Texas?   \n\n\"We can try Burger up,\" I mentioned.  \n\n\"Why don't you just call them?\" hissed the appropriately nicknamed Viper.  \n\nTrue.  We didn't have to keep driving around aimlessly.  So I call Burger Up, and a very pleasant, sweet voice assures me they are indeed open.  \n\nViper: \"What was her name?  She sounded hot.\"\n  \nMe: \"Paige.\"\n\nViper: \"Yeah, she's definitely hot.  Have you ever met an unattractive Paige?\"\n\nMe: \"Good point.  At least we have that going for us.\"\n\nPaige was indeed attractive, but this review isn't about a photogenic individual who happens to work at Burger Up.  It's about what ended up being a visit to our fourth choice for burgers in Nashville.  \n\nBurger Up follows a national trend towards upscale burgers.  My particular order consisted of a medium rare patty served with aged cheddar, Benton's bacon (very good), and ketchup served on an artisan bun.  Basically, it was a gussied up bacon cheeseburger, but it was a rather tasty one.  My major complaint is that I wish the actual meat itself exhibited more flavor.  Having said that, the burger was cooked properly and the flavors worked well together.  I ordered some wilted spinach on the side (mediocre) and truffle fries.  Let's talk about those truffle fries for a bit.  I know more people are apparently into the sweet potato fries here, but I think they are missing the boat.  Burger Up's truffle tries have pleasant aroma, taste great, and are the perfect texture for soaking up oil.  If you are on a diet, it is true you should skip these delightful fries.  But if that were the case, why are you at a burger joint in the first place?  Seriously, if you get nothing else out of my review, please do yourself a favor and order the truffle fries.  \n\nBurger Up also boast an interesting beer menu with semi-obscure breweries from the Deep South included in the list.  I tried a pecan-infused amber from Mississippi - not bad.  I could imagine Burger Up could be a decent place to drink for a bit after eating.  \n\nIf I attended Vanderbilt, I would probably go here on a moderately frequent basis.

Here, you can order any kind of frozen concoction you want because they have a wall of frozen drink machines glorious churning up the colorful sweet stuff. You might feel like a kid at buffet where you can mix & match Pepsi and Mt. Dew and even Dr. Pepper (I was that child once). They have all these varieties and then will do something outrageous like a Pi\u00f1a Colada/Hypnotiq parfait. I stuck to the classic pi\u00f1a and wow, it even tasted like it wasn't filled with that obvious artificial flavor that some daiquiri places typically use (Gene's version is not drinkable, I'm sorry). It's true that I normally shun the sweet boozy stuff but there's something about a hot New Orleans day and the way these days practically beg for frozen cocktails. I'm a believer now.

When asked by chef/owner Tanzanika what they could do to make the menu more veg-friendly, I suggested having some tofu options, maybe (I just love tofu. I know it's crazy). She laughed but seems like she's open to the idea. It's not even really necessary and if you're open to dairy, they have pizzas that look really great, too. Their emphasis is on FRESH food and yes, they shop daily. My guy had a burger that he said tastes just like \"Mom's burger,\" which for him is a big compliment (for me, not so much. My mom's burgers possibly turned me off meat forever. Please don't tell her I mentioned it, K?)\n\nService is fantastic from the moment you open the door and are warmly welcomed.

I wore these to MOMS one year and I may have been sobbing in pain by the end of the night, but damn, I looked good). \n\nThe other day an email arrived from John Fluevog. Angels sang. Cartoon birds landed on my shoulders. The bright purple stretchy velvet over the knee boots, aka \"The Munchies\" are in fact vegan! I called the local store and was informed that they have them in stock. Ten minutes later, I arrived, tried on my usual size 6, though because they are pointy toed, I expected I'd need to go up a size. The 6 fit perfectly and because they are stretchy, they can accommodate a variety of calves; skinny to muscled to those with some heft. These boots are perfect for Mardi Gras... and for Prince tributes. \n\nJF, thank you for making my dreams come true. Please continue making vegan vogs for those of us who live your motto, \"Life is too short to wear boring shoes.\"", "date": "2017-01-31 16:20:22"}, {"_key": "1025800", "_id": "reviews/1025800", "_rev": "_fNyrz-i--e", "review_id": "eAmget6UXG9WIVEX_6KFyg", "user_id": "0G-QF457q_0Z_jKqh6xWiA", "business_id": "54vEFcAri3Wj6cdM4ljDBA", "stars": 4, "useful": 9, "funny": 8, "cool": 5, "text": "Let it be known that I'm notoriously more stingy with my stars when it comes to hotels. I mean, I gave the W three stars and I'm sticking to it! It's just that I've stayed in all kinds of hotels pretty much my entire life, and I do mean those ranging from budget family joints like Days Inn to luxury hotels like the Hyatt, to smaller, cooler boutique hotels like Hotel on Rivington and now the Moonrise.\n\nI'll be honest with you, the amenities aren't quite as great as those at the W, and so normally I'd give the Moonrise a solid 3 stars (A-OK doesn't mean average in hotel stars, believe me). The Moonrise gets an extra star for the vintage moon photos that are just about everywhere in the hotel. I think decor-wise, Moonrise is my favorite, beating out even the Hotel On Rivingon's sleek rock and roll blood red/black decor! I just love the theme to death!!  There are the cute touches like the voice in the elevator making it seem like you're taking off/landing, the way that it always feels like nighttime is falling in the public parts of the hotel, the stationary, pens, all of it. LOVE.\n\nThat said, they don't replenish your products (H20, which I may like even more than Bliss' shower gel, shampoo and conditioner...Bliss wins for that facial wash, however), the way the W does. Oh well, not really a huge deal, and I guess I don't blame them. My room was spotless, extremely cozy and the bed was really luxe with loads of pillows. Temperature in the room was also perfect. \n\nThe gym was sufficient for a traveling morning workout. Three elliptical machines, three treadmills and three stationery bikes. The strengthening equipment left a bit more to be desired (no free weights and just one weight machine in the place that shares two sets of the same weights, so essentially only two people can work out on half the equipment at the same time). Again, not a big deal. I was thrilled by the lounge outside of it that allowed for working stations overlooking the main lobby. All so very well-appointed.\n\nCourtesy of the staff was adequate. I had an annoying check-in experience that I'm too weary to even talk about. Nothing major. Front desk staff was courteous (especially the gal working there in the evening). \n\nNot sure what was up with the cleaning staff. I had this one very eager dude wanting a greeting early in the morning and did not *get* that all I was able to utter was \"good morning.\" I hate being rude, but uh, it was early, I hadn't had much sleep and I just wanted to get to the effing gym. I stepped onto the elevator feeling guilty about not being more pleasant.  I really hope that guy wasn't cleaning my room. I do have issues with male housekeeping staff. The very idea of it just creeps me out, especially when traveling alone.\n\nNoise, well, I'll be honest, there was a morning when people were talking way too much in the hall (step to the elevator, please!) and there was a night that I just couldn't sleep due to the crowd spilling out into the street (apparently the lobby has that disco after hours thing going on that the W has) and what was more annoying was the asshole in the room next to me who banged on the wall to indicate that I was talking too loudly on Skype. F-You. It wasn't even 11pm. I'm hoping that the revelers kept his ass awake at 2am like they did me. Misery loves company.

It's a good thing that they have a recycling program because I'm getting all three of these candles refilled as soon as they run out. I think gardenia is my favorite, with All That Jazz a very close second. I've never been all that happy with floral candles because they seem almost artificial. Not sure what magic they have going on up in here, but the candles smell like the most intense varieties of blooms and it makes me happy just walking into a room where I have one burning.

Their employees are nice without making you feel like you've committed a sin by asking for plastic (to be fair, the cashiers at WF aren't nearly as self-righteous as the floor staff who seem like they'd spit on you if you ask for something that is against WF puredom, like artificial sweetener. Not that I'd ever ask for it, but a friend once had the audacity to do so and was met with a lecture).\n6. Kick ass olive bar\n7. They just have a lot more grocery items, and more affordable options at that\n8. Not everything has to be gourmet specialty foods and products. They have those, but sometimes you want a bag of Zapps chips or a harsh cleaning product for eff's sake!\n9. Nowhere nearly as pretentious (for example, you probably don't notice, but WF has plenty of produce that's from Mexico, California and other places).  \n10. Aeroponic rooftop garden! How cool is that?\n11. Phenomenal booze/wine/beer selection\n\nIssues with this particular Rouses that would have me head to WF instead:\n\n1. The oils area is confusing not only to shoppers but to employees as well. I had three different employees attempt to find me a vessel in which to pour truffle oil from the jug thingamajig and no one could help me. Not their fault as apparently they had just changed all that around, but no one clued the staff in. \n2. There's just not enough organic produce. It would be ideal as well, if the organic stuff wasn't all mixed in with the other stuff.\n3. Not enough produce in general (uh, dino kale shouldn't be that rare).\n4. Lack of gourmet whole bean coffee\n\n\nNumbers 2-4 have double weight, as I'm all about the organic produce selection. A fine whole bean coffee i(extremely dark roast that I grind myself) is what gets me through a morning. I realize not everyone is as particular as me, but there you have it. Supermarket shopping is painful enough, I'd rather not have to go to more than one store per week.\n\nOther things to note:\n\n-gourmet and deli sections in this Rouses is really outstanding and similar to WF.

If the Bloody Mary is the most complex cocktail, then the bartenders at Maurepas are surely at Mensa level. \n\nThe menu is divided into 2 sections grains, vegetables, and starch and then meat and fish.

The staff here are all extremely nice and helpful. You don't get any training pressure, either, which is nice. It's also not ever crowded. They get points, rather stars, for all of that.

Walking to yoga is of course ideal, and Wild Lotus is also a phenomenal experience, so I moved my practice over entirely to there. A couple years, a lapse in practice - I'm living a half hour from civilization- and I started up again at Swan River back in May. It's just been idyllic! I love this studio, with its enormous room upstairs with tons of natural light and air. I love that they burn incense, making for the good smells! I love the morning/afternoon vegan cafe downstairs that makes some of the best cold brew in the city, along with delicious plant-based options (and sinful baked goods that everyone needs once in a while). I love the teachers, especially Michelle and Keith. They both make yoga so approachable that I'd happily bring anyone new to yoga to one of their classes. Love love love. \n\nOne thing that makes this studio unique is the \"Assist\" cards (at least I've never seen those at any other studio I've practiced at). If you're not feeling like having the teacher do hands-on assists any given day (or time during the class), you turn the card over. There's also the option for no touching during Savasana. \n\nTheir schedule is especially appealing to me, as I live a half hour to 40 min in traffic from Downtown. Those mid and late afternoon classes work for me, but there's also morning and evening classes if that works better for people with more conventional schedules. \n\nHaving two yoga studios that you love in town is priceless!

Read: not stifling hot. I've never liked hot yoga or Bikrim, but at least when studios advertise that the class is such, I know to avoid it. There are a few studios and teachers in town who don't advertise their class as hot yoga, yet shut off a/c and fans on mid summer days.

I've spend many an idyllic afternoon/evening here. I've also booked several of my colleagues at the Mazarin when they've come to New Orleans and heard good things from them (as recently as January 2015).\n\nSo when looking to book a hotel for a work conference 10 people I was leading, Hotel Mazarin was at the top of my list. And when you realize that in other local hotels you're probably going to get that New Orleans jenk known as \"charm\"  for a similar price, I will absolutely recommend Hotel Mazarin for being immaculate (with one tiny exception in my bathroom, but I'm insane), amenities (almost Westin-quality beds, flatscreen TVs), and the restrained modern baroque decor (gold fixtures, marble floors). If you're a breakfast-lover, you cannot beat that deluxe complimentary breakfast (eggs & bacon, pastry, toast, cereal, juices). Seriously, I've stayed in New Orleans hotels with TVs straight out of the 90s, ancient (as in, not antique) beds, dated decor and questionable levels of cleanliness. I won't name names (search my reviews if you must). But Hotel Mazarin boasts higher standards. \n\nThat said, my colleagues and I had some issues during our stay last month that should be noted. \n\n-multiple reports of the front desk/reception staff being aloof and often downright surly (unacceptable and so not typical of the superb hospitality that is the custom of New Orleans. I'm honestly scratching my head over this one). One of my people was reprimanded for putting a room card/key in her wallet when she came down to report that her keys weren't working (she never put it in her wallet but even if she had?!) When she explained that she had done no such thing, the response from the desk was an eye roll. Another colleague called the desk to report that his room was noisy. With a week of late nights and early mornings ahead of him, he thought he could request a quieter room. He was informed that he was in a quiet room. That's it. No apologies or explanations. I can write more, but in the interest of space, I leave it at these two instances. \n\nHowever, all of the other hotel staff were great, from management to catering (special props to the lovely Mary who took care of our conference room. She is a gem!) Everyone in the breakfast room and in catering were ALL so lovely and friendly (everyone says good morning and the catering manager walked around talking to everyone, making sure they were having a great stay). \n\n-the showers are extremely tricky to work and some of us didn't have anything hotter than lukewarm water. This is horrible to deal with first thing in the morning on one of the coldest weeks in New Orleans. I live here and I know the city's water pressure leaves a lot to be desired, especially in old French Quarter buildings, but this isn't OK in a hotel. Apparently there was some trick to get it to work and I can't even tell you what that is, because it's really *that* tricky. There should be instructions posted, unless this was a fluke with half of my colleagues' rooms. \n\n-catering: although the food is good, it's extremely overpriced for what you get. You are not allowed to bring in outside food, so if you're using their conference room you're going to have to use these services. I know this is common practice in hotel conference rooms, so although I won't fault them for this, next year I'll try and find an alternative.\n\nRelated to this: when setting up my catering order, I specified that three of my group had dietary restrictions/extreme food allergies. For the very expensive muffaletta sandwiches, I thought they'd at least offer a GF bread option for one or two of them for my G/F colleague, but no. Second, I was told the king cake would be nut free and it was not. Suddenly I saw one of my colleagues leaving the room in the middle of a session and I later learned that he had to go up to his room and take an emergency Benadryl. If he hadn't, he likely would have needed to go to the hospital, for his nut allergy is that extreme. If I put on my request that at least one dessert should be nut free and the only other dessert item is pralines, the cooks should pay attention and not put nuts on the king cake. Pretty simple. Attention to detail is crucial. Again, when you're paying extremely high prices for catering, high expectations should be met.\n\nI would still recommend Hotel Mazarin thanks to its amazing location for visitors to our city, as well as the nice perks, including two comped drinks at the fabulous 21st Amendment Bar.

It's discouraging to note that even though I don't really even wear them anymore, they are slowly but surely disintegrating (especially my 1920s and 30s numbers).

I'm a lover all things Tiki, though I have to admit, I hate loathe and despise sweet drinks for obvious reasons, but hell, it's a Yelp review so I'll just come out and say it: usually sweet drinks mask cheap liquor. Usually sweet drinks are meant for people who aren't drinkers and can't stand the taste of alcohol. And last but certainly not least, sweet drinks mean for inevitable hangover. I pride myself on being a veteran drinker and at most, get one hangover a year. In fact, my year anniversary of my last hangover is coming up.

I settled on a Hemingway Daiquiri, which is frozen and perfect because it's not a fruit daiquiri, so not filled with artificial nonsense, just lime, rum, & maraschino liqueur. And potent, seeing as I was feeling a nice buzz after two.\n\nThey also have a menu feature small plates with a tropical flavor. DO NOT PASS UP THAT CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE DESSERT. The Tiki gods command it, too. Seriously. It really is the stuff of the gods. Chocolate, coconut, banana sauce... 'scuse me while I talk in tongues.

Yes, I had been living under a NYC rock. I mean, stone. A pizza stone.\n\nI had been told St. Louis style pizza featured some kind of cheese known as Provel. Actually, I had been told by someone who is not from the area that it was Provolone, but I was quickly corrected by Abby S, that Provel and Provolone are two different things. Intrigued, but not without some trepidation, I figured, sure, I'll try St. Louis style pizza! Across the street from the hotel to Pi, we went.\n\nOnly, Pi is *anti* Provel, as it turns out (their t-shirts proudly indicate this). Instead, Pi is known for its cornmeal crust and although it is \"deep dish,\" it's heavy on the sauce (*not* heavy on the cheese). Now *that* is my kind of pie. FYI they also have thin crust if that is your thing. Typically, that is my thing, but when in St. Louis, one should do as the St. Louans (is that what they're called?) do. Although, I think St. Louis pizzas are traditionally cracker crust. Ah, there I go again. ANYWAY...\n\nIt was a beautiful spring day on Wednesday, so we sat outside and were immediately taken care of by our friendly waiter who brought us water and drinks (really good house iced tea that is infused with some kind of blossom). We were warned that the deep dish pizzas take 35 minutes to prepare, which was fine with us.\n\nIt was worth the wait. Holy delish, batgirl! I ordered kalamata olives and mushrooms on mine and the sauce to cheese ratio was just perfect. I love the sauce! Chunky tomato, not sweet. Mmmmmm mmmm good. And that crust was just awesome. If polenta were a crust, well, there ya go! I just love the combination of cornmeal and tomato sauce. It wasn't tough, like i expected. Oh yes, I'm a fan!\n\nWe were there for a pretty long time and our waiter kept checking back on us, refilled our drinks without interrupting our meeting and finally, it was time for a limoncello cocktail.

If people into the intricacies of flavor, texture and ingredients of food are \"foodies,\" what would you call the same types of people who are into cocktails and booze?

I'm just going to give you my take on it.\n\nI'll give my only criticism here and as you can see from my 5 stars, it certainly didn't ruin my experience. It does bear mentioning. Check-ins on the first day closed at 6pm. I arrived at 6:10 due to crazy traffic due to Obama being in town thus causing a regular 30 minute trip to take over an hour. Although the staff was still in the reception room, they refused to check me in. I think check-in should close a lot later than 6pm, after all, the opening bashes were all going on that night and without your tickets, you can't get in to them (or so I thought. Luckily I was able to get into both Better with Age and the Absolut opening party with my assistant's tickets since she had her media badge). Besides, with people coming in from all over at all times *and* it being that it's in a hotel, next year it would be nice to see extended check-in times.\n\nThat aside, I thoroughly enjoyed my lost week, I mean, incredibly fun-filled week at TOTC. From the volunteer staff who checked you in at each event and seminar (all of them incredibly nice) to the tasting rooms to the hotels and other types of event venues, all I can say is that I was left thoroughly impressed. There was just so much going on, it's impossible to catch everything. I paced myself rather well (time for a pat on the back). \n\nAnd that L'agniappe Lounge. WOW!!! This room, I believe, is only for media and other sponsors, but holy crap. All of the brands and sponsors left swag, product and other fun materials (favorite had to be the moleskine notebooks thanks to Tanqueray or Hennessey-- it's tastefully embossed into the cover). OH!! And the bottles of shrubs and bitters!!!! I also now have an entire bar of tiny bottles (there were regular bottles, too, but I didn't take any due to not wanting to carry them around). Boozers, you will feel like a kid in a candy shop in that room! Incredible. \n\nMy favorite events were Better with Age and the Absolut bash (I mean... they had SNOW pumped into the room!). The Diageo Happy Hour was fun because of the people I was with, however the food left a lot to be desired (do not bring a bread bowl around to hundreds of people to dip their hands into. Whose idea was that??)\n... not to mention that although there were master mixologists at the bars, they had to make due with the ingredients that were given to them (kind of like the \"Chopped\" for bartenders). I definitely preferred the vodka cocktails to any others.\n\nWhile the booze flowed freely, my tip to attendees is to make sure and pack some energy bars because this event is not about food, so don't expect any. Plan accordingly! Also next year, I plan to stay in a hotel so I can stumble to/from events (and leave all the goodies I pick up along the way in my room). \n\nNote: I did not attend any of the Spirited Dinners this year.", "date": "2012-08-23 16:25:08"}, {"_key": "389931", "_id": "reviews/389931", "_rev": "_fNysAse--O", "review_id": "muAQEDT0CYAs3DCrIlUYIA", "user_id": "0G-QF457q_0Z_jKqh6xWiA", "business_id": "bMpKXcKFetJQsa42UR25cQ", "stars": 4, "useful": 5, "funny": 3, "cool": 5, "text": "Ever get overwhelmed by ostalgie? \"Of course you can't, Joi, you grew up in the ol' US of A, safely thousands of miles away from the Eastern block, while your relatives were surviving the aftermath of a cold Prague Spring.\n\nBut, but...

I had been drinking coffee all morning at the fabulous Park Avenue Coffee next door, but alas, a low fat blueberry muffin did not keep me sated for more than 3 hours, so come lunchtime, I checked Yelp and was overjoyed to see an Italian restaurant is located right next door.

It's offered both as a small plate and as an entree (don't quote me on this, but I believe the full size portion is offered on a lunch special).\n\nMolto sadness: apparently due to the freeze in Mexico, there are no eggplants to be had, as I was told by the waitress.

I hate to say this, when I wanted to like a place so much (yes, that warm greeting really does go a long way), but it is possibly the worst I've ever had.

Inexcusable in an Italian restaurant.\n\nOn to the main course: let's say it made up for the soup in droves. I quite possible inhaled this dish! Delicious pasta, crisp broccoli, fresh mushrooms with just the right amount of olive oil and garlic.

I have mixed feelings. I truly appreciate the operation behind the new Perestroika at Pravda, those geniuses behind some of my favorite mixology meccas in town, Cure and Bellocq, but I so badly miss the vibe of the original. \n\nLet me explain. The original was dark and red, where the new is drenched in lighter hues, but it's colorless as far as I can tell. The original was cozy and inviting (at least to the likes of me) with Victorian lamps and Soviet memorabilia everywhere. The new is rather devoid of any kind of signature style. Simply put: it's rather bare. And too brightly lit. This brightness makes whomever I bring here want to go elsewhere. I get that they have food now and you can't exactly be eating in the dark (well, I do, but I suppose it's not ideal), but... but... I prefer it a dark and stormy cocktail bar. Both Bellocq and Cure have the perfect ambiance, so I guess I don't understand what's up here. \n\nWhere they will shine: cocktails. This is what this group does best. The original Pravda didn't have a cocktail menu and just stuck to mixed drinks and absinthe. Perestroika has signature drinks and I guess it's heading in the direction of an upscale Tiki bar, though the only evidence of that right now is a Mai Tai on the menu. I was here on repeal of Prohibition Day and they had a special menu which was awesome. \n\nI appreciate the slow change, it's just that right now it seems stuck in this kind of uncertain purgatory.

My first compelling review of a Rouses can be seen here http://www.yelp.com/biz/rouses-market-new-orleans-4#hrid:TNxLSyhrXPZCzTgmpqjeHg\n\nAnd in the spirit of that review, I'm going to go with a similar formula and also show what makes Mid-City's Rouses a different shopping experience than the one in the CBD.\n\nWhy I'd opt to go to Rouses over Whole Foods:\n(these are the same points as my first review, I took out a few for the sake of brevity)\n\n1. It's Louisiana-owned\n2. They have Cajun hot nuts\n3. Related to the above, they have an array of other NOLA specialty items (tourists, buy your foodie souvenirs here rather than the FQ)\n4. Kick ass olive bar (but just about as pricey as WF's)\n5. They just have a lot more grocery items, and more affordable options at that\n6. Not everything has to be gourmet specialty foods and products. They have those, but sometimes you want a bag of Zapps chips or a harsh cleaning product for eff's sake!\n7. Phenomenal wine/beer selection (see my note about hard liquor below).\n\nThere is no hydrophonic rooftop garden at this one, but that's OK. What they do have that the CBD Rouses doesn't have is a larger and easier to navigate produce section. That said, the organics are still seriously lacking. And what's with the tomatoes imported from Mexico? The store is bigger and there is less of that clusterfuck feeling that you'd expect in any supermarket smack dab in the middle of downtown. \n\nThe popcorn selection is bliss, by the way. An entire section of the snack aisle and I found those black and red popcorn types that promise all kinds of antioxidant benefits. I don't really care, though. I just wanted to buy black popcorn.\n\nOn a distressing note, I cannot believe there is an entire subcategory of Hot Pockets, as noted on the aisle sign (Ie the head category is Frozen and then below it, they have subcategories of normal stuff like pizza, vegetables, fruit etc.) I mean, Hot Pockets are a brand, not a type of food. Actually calling Hot Pockets \"food\" is also a stretch. Sorry, that's just my hatred of convenience foods shining through and has nothing to do with my star rating. But please, for the love of your body: Stop your Hot Pocket habit.\n\nOne thing that is really hella lame: what's with the separate counter for hard liquor? It's just terribly inconvenient and we actually skipped buying the bottle of vodka we had planned on buying because who wants to check out twice at the grocery store?\n\nI think of all the Rouses, my favorite is the one on Tchoupitoulas, followed by Mid-City and CBD at a tie.

It was a dark and stormy day...\n\n(yikes, that doesn't bode well. Neruda would never be prone to such clich\u00e9!)\n\nSo, let's just say that the overwhelming vibe of Il Posto is that of a rustic Italian cafe. Not unlike the cafe in the movie Il Postino. You may be overcome by the desire to just order shot after shot of espresso, but the sight and smells of the cafe's offerings will convince you to do otherwise.\n\nI admit I'm not at all a fan of half service. I prefer to sit down and order from a server, receive food from my server, ask them for whatever else I may need, and then tip them.

The cheese plate is divine and has just the right amount of each variety, my favorites being the goat and Brie. The bread that comes with is irresistible and fresh, rather than the typical crostini.

I realize that sounds ridiculous, but it's true. Take the salted caramel, for example (I know you will). I tried my friend's and was quite taken with it. I love the idea of salted caramel but I've had that flavor before at other places and found it sickeningly sweet- not at all salty. Creole Creamery has somehow managed to achieve just the right balance of flavor.\n\nAnd so, I bid Creole Creamery farewell... meaning in this review.

Ruined, I tell you.\n\nA stuffy corporate cookie cutter room just isn't going to ever cut it again when the promise of dark walls, vintage fridges and turntables with charmingly worn records are waiting for me! I believe the room I stayed in was a medium size (ie, not the smallest, not the biggest, not a suite). I absolutely adored it and wished I was staying longer than merely one night. Comfy bed, delicious bath products, space for dancing... What a unique space! I didn't indulge, but appreciated the variety at the mini bar (nice prices too. What?!) December weekday rates are so so incredibly fair, I don't see how anyone could opt to AirBnB it. Naturally when it's high season, rates will comparable with other hotels, however their group rates always seem the fairest in town and I book groups on the regular.\n\nThere's a dark and slightly mysterious theme going on throughout the hotel. Rather than old timey Southern style, which is kind of the NOLA hotel thing traditionally, the Ace is designed in the style of a wealthy artist, movie mogul or musician's mansion in the late 1930s... perhaps in Manhattan or Havana. I know, I know. I may not be making sense. I wasn't around in the 1930s (but I kind of wish I was). It's a little too much verging on, but not quite, Mid Century, and definitely post Art Deco (just not TOO post...) I suck at describing the things I love.\n \nThe bar area... I just never ever want to leave it! Between some of the best bartenders in town (not to mention super friendly, no matter how packed it is), the comfortable sofas, and lighting so perfect, you feel like a movie star... oh and the cocktails don't hurt either. I stuck to bubbly but tasted some of the other concoctions and was truly impressed. Then there's the sitting area just beyond Stumptown Coffee. They recently redecorated it and it's one of most hauntingly beautiful spots in town. Go see for yourself.\n\nDo I need to touch upon the rooftop pool area? It's a popular spot in town. I've spent many an early evening here sipping on frozen goodness in the summer.

The plates are small, but contain mucho deliciousness. You know what they say about too much of a good thing, right? That said, this is the kind of place you don't come starving after not eating all day (like last night). Besides the flavorful and light bulgogi, I also dig the edamame which comes in sesame oil. Falafel balls are amongst the best I've had, however I think they could use a lot more tahini (unless it was left off by accident. I couldn't taste any).\n\nCocktails. Last night's drinks were both a hit and a miss for me. The absinthe drink is described beautifully on the menu but the flavors described just did not come through. It really just tasted like absinthe. The lavender lace, OTOH, I could have drank all night. Champagne plus lavender? Oh hells yeah.\n\nMusic. What can I say? They book great stuff here.

Yes, please!\n\nIt's so hard to settle on just one place for your big night, so my guy made the decision for me. That's nice for a change as you can imagine I'm always being asked to make the choices by friends and family.\n\nMy experience was again good, but not 5-star excellent, given the caliber of the restaurant. It was a Saturday night and the restaurant was reasonably filled, as it was Carnival season and getting close to the big day. My issue was with the lighting. I'm of the mind that at nighttime, unless you're at a diner or fast food joint (and that would be *never* for me), lights should be dimmed and the candles brought out. Not so at Muriel's. Some people hate dimly lit restaurants, so have at it if this is you! \n\nAnother thing, and this is more of a criticism of my fellow Americans than anything: Muriel's doesn't have dress requirements like some of our fancier joints in town, but really, when you go out to a *nice* restaurants with table cloths and a typical bill for 2 is over $100 can you please make an effort?! Or how's this, please don't wear shorts and T-shirts. Or worn out jeans. At least the hostess made the guy take off his baseball cap. On that note, this \"no hats\" rule seems at odds with the fact that they let the table of 4 slobs in anyway. A brightly lit restaurant filled with tables of bachelorette parties (I saw no less than 4 tables of ladies on the prowl) wearing silly wigs and hats do not for a romantic dinner out make. If they are going to ask that gentlemen remove hats (and I get that, even if the hat is a really nice one), it seems they should stay consistent with a more refined vibe. No?\n\nNow that *that* is out of the way...\n\nI started with the wood-grilled Eggplant Reloude. *Incroyable!!!!! So good that I needed to exclaim in French. The eggplant is perfectly grilled and is sweet/smoky with delicioso (see? I did it again) ricotta/marscapone inside and topped with a bit of tomato sauce. Perfetto. (stop, Joi, just stop).\n\nAs I mentioned in my previous review, Muriel's main nod to vegetarians is with a seasonal \"Vegetarian Soiree\" entree. I appreciate the seasonality but last year's vegetable plate was much much better than this year's - I visited during the same season, winter. This time there was a so-so mushroom crepe rather than polenta. There was no kale. There was inedible eggplant that was tough/bitter/chewy. Pickled cucumbers. Pedestrian spaghetti squash. In fact, it was altogether unmemorable to the point that I had to just look at the menu to remember what was on it so I could write this review. Not bad, just nowhere nearly as impressive as last year. Give us vegetarians at least one other exciting option, perhaps? A vegetarian tasting menu? Dare to dream...\n\nOn the other hand, that butterscotch pudding dessert was birthday bliss-worthy.\n\nSo, there you have it.

They are uber important!\n\nI was referred to Dr. Loyola by my regular dentist at Mid-City Smiles. I'll be honest and say I had misgivings when I walked into what could only be called a dreary waiting room (it's tiny, without windows). I was called into yet another dark, slightly sinister room (I was scared like a baby and I have a terrific imagination. C'mon, laugh with me here) and then realized it had to be this way because, X-rays. But come on, at least make the waiting room inviting?\n\nOK, so I realize how ridiculous this all sounds. The *good* news? Getting my tooth pulled here was 10X more seamless than it was when I got my last one pulled elsewhere three years ago (I'll spare you the horror story). Dr. Loyola had me in and out in about 30 minutes. Can you believe that? I was terrified about going under with anesthesia as last time, I just received novocaine. And that, was horrible, so it didn't take much convincing. My last dentist couldn't get my bottom tooth out (after 20 minutes of yanking. I guess I can't totally spare you from that horror story), and so recommended that I go to a surgeon. Dr. Loyola told me that it's pretty common for the bottom teeth to be more difficult. He was also honest and said that I should just spare myself enduring the procedure while conscious. \n\nOne other thing: he was also honest that the source of my pain could be due to something else (namely, clenching and grinding my teeth) and said that I didn't necessarily have to get the tooth out. I appreciate being conservative rather than \"just get it yanked, you don't need it\" philosophy that's all the rage these days, but I knew it had to go and I was right. \n\nGetting put under was not quite fun (I have these veins that are difficult to tap into) but what I did like was that it was almost twilight-y (not of the glitter and teenaged vampire variety) and I wasn't entirely unconscious. I didn't feel any pain, though I guess I was moving a lot b/c I recall being reprimanded a bit by the doctor. He's more stern than jokey, but whatever. The tooth. Is. Gone.\n\nThe reason for three stars? Their billing policy is utterly absurd and unheard of (to me, at least). Get this: even though my insurance covers anesthesia, I had to lay out the 300+ dollars *just in case they didn't.* What kind of BS is that? Oh and the clincher? The ridiculous % surcharge for using your CC. Because surely it makes sense to carry almost 400 dollars in cash around with you for dental services. It's unacceptable and I won't return here for that reason alone (it cost me well over 30 dollars for the \"convenience\"). I realize you've been burned by patients before but that doesn't exactly instill confidence in your professionalism. I've been to two other dentists in NOLA and they always bill you later if your insurance doesn't cover a procedure.\n\nSo, that's that. I'd give only two stars for the ridiculous payment policy but I was rather impressed by my practically pain and discomfort-free extraction (and that's probably what you really need to care about). Plus the ladies who assist and work the reception are really nice. And yes, I did receive a check from them right away after they were paid by my insurance.

There's one of a lady that is positively bone-chilling (and I don't mean one of those silly fake hologram deals where the 'normal' portrait turns into a grinning wraith). \n\nThis is also a place where you can find a decent amount of vintage Mardi Gras throws (Czech glass beads) and other memorabilia (like a framed poster from 1986... which is *not* an antique, OK? Just sayin'). \n\nI like this place and if I ever had an extra 125.00, I'd buy one of those aforementioned portraits. Thing is, the prices here are fairly higher than I am used to spending.

I'm a regular at Lilly's Cafe in the LGD because they have such an incredible variety of vegan dishes and it's insanely cheap. That said, the ambiance lends itself better to lunch (not to mention they close at 9pm and sometimes that's dinner time for me). To add to that, they don't have a bar. This year for my birthday dinner, I wanted Vietnamese food and I wanted a cocktail or two... enter Mint.\n\nFirst of all there's the name conjuring up both minty goodness served alongside a giant bowl of bun or pho and the impression that this place is *mint*. I've wanted to try it since it opened last year, although it's on the other side of town from where I live and I know it gets really packed on weekends.\n\nAmbiance: more spiffy, more... mint than Lilly's, with their mirrors, modern furniture and chandeliers, not to mention a large bar. I'm not too crazy about how bright it is in there and definitely not a fan of the huge TVs, but that didn't detract from all the other greatness going on... like the food and the cocktail I soon had in my hands (I can ignore TVs, but it's funny how the child next to me was transfixed on the Simpsons as soon as he sat down. We need less TVs in restaurants, world!). \n\nGetting back to the cocktail: Mint Iced Tea. GET. IT. On this warm Sunday in February (75 degrees in the evening!), I couldn't resist a taste of summer and even though I typically detest sweetened tea, this drink is on point! I can easily see myself throwing back three of these on a porch somewhere. It goes just as well with the avocado spring rolls I ordered, however. These spring rolls are now my favorite in town, because they are just bursting with fresh ingredients, like mint, avo, carrots, sprouts and vermicelli. Dip these babies into that perfect peanut sauce that comes with. So so so good! \n\nVeg heads get happy for there are options a-plenty. I can't refuse a bowl of bun, and there is a lemongrass tofu option that is brimming over with tofu and vermicelli noodles. Lilly's has an option to add veggies to that, so next time I'll ask if that's possible here because it could only make this better! The lemongrass tofu is spectacularly tasty, with a texture that is crunchy on the outside and slightly firm on the in. Herbs and hot sauce only serve to heighten the fresh flavor that's going on up in here! (side note: please keep those Sri Racha bottles clean... the nozzle had that unsightly crust going on that makes me kind of ill to consider).\n\nDessert? Not for me, as I was far too full. I couldn't even manage a second cocktail (my typical dessert, truth be told). Portions are enormous, but the food quality and freshness do not suffer.

I first attended a wedding here on Halloween 2010. My two fabulous friends pulled out all the stops and had an amazing horror movie-themed wedding where Jason and Leatherface got things started with a bang (er, a chainsaw). Sure seems like the folks behind Muriels worked well with my friends and the wedding was an occasion to remember. We were upstairs, where private events are held, and took breaks from the main room in the bordello-like seance room. One of my favorite things about this night included hanging out with cocktails on huge balcony overlooking Jackson Square. \n\nBy the way, if you're dining here and there isn't an event going on, you're free to go upstairs and check all that out. You can even have a drink and bring it up to the Seance Room (and I strongly recommend that you do, if you like rooms dripping in red, chandeliers, velvet and brocade. It makes me want to decorate my entire apartment in a similar fashion). \n\nRecently I came to realize that besides the gorgeous environs, the restaurant serves up some really great food and drink. My friends and I had lunch here recently. We were seated in the room where they open the huge glass doors to the sidewalk so you can watch passersby and listen to music being played out in Jackson Square. \n\nAt lunchtime, they offer $4 Bloody Marys, wines and martinis. I indulged in a Bloody Mary, as I am often wont to do, and found it to be quite satisfactory (garnished with olives, pickled green beans and citrus and served in a pint glass. No skimping here just cuz it's a mere 4 bucks). \n\nI ordered the modestly-named Vegetable Plate. I'll be honest and say I wasn't expecting much because I've had many a pedestrian veg plate where they barely even marinate the vegetables before skewering them and grilling. Booooring. \n\nI'm thrilled to report that Muriel's Vegetable Plate belongs in the Vegetable Plate Hall of Fame. First of all, it contains braised kale. Almost 'nuff said there, but I'll go on to say its flavor is just so so so very good. The other star of the plate is that compact square of polenta flavored with herbs and Parm cheese. Everything is so delicately placed, which I love, and nothing overwhelmed with oils or heavy sauces to \"make up for\" the fact that you're eating a plate of vegetables. There's a delightful little bit of everything from beets to parsnips to tender shittake mushrooms. A healthy, hearty plate. Thank you, Muriels! I seriously could not stop thinking about it all day.\n\nThey also have a gluten-free menu.\n\nI think I'll be dining here on the regular when I have visitors in town.

While that didn't actually happen, what I did order made me extremely happy, not to mention the attentive and friendly service, and the environment within this boisterous old jernt. \n\nMy friends and I got in on one of those fabulous curtained booths. I love private booths, what can I say? So, they had me there. I was dubious about what I'd be served here, I can't lie.

Forgive my saying so, but if you don't add on at least some burnt ends, you're a goddamned fool. \n\nThe burnt ends are the most delicious meat candy you've ever been lucky enough to put in your mouth, and walking out of here without any is the worst mistake you've made since the 90s.*\n\nI'm of the opinion that neither the burnt ends nor the ribs need anything else, but Bogart's offers up several sauces for your use. Of the four, the Sweet Maegan Ann is my favorite, with its sweet molassesy goodness mixing in very well with pulled pork (which does need something else). My wife is a very saucy lass, and she threw the Voodoo and the Vinegar in there as well. \n\nAs always, sides are an afterthought to meat, and Bogart's could honestly serve slaps to my face along with those ribs and I'd still come back for more. Thankfully for my already misshapen face, they've got a delicious deviled egg potato salad, some nice pickles, beans, and slaw instead. \n\nTo sum up: \n\nCome here. Get ribs, burnt ends and some sides (more than you think you need of everything). Eat all of this food on the picnic tables outside. Listen to the blues covers coming out of the speakers.

The sauteed crab was pretty good imitation of the ginger and scallion style crab you would get in Chinatown, except with less starch, which is a good thing.  Still missing the crayfish, though.  The sushi is still pretty much the same as before, but the seafood is definitely better.  Thus, I'm upgrading to 3.5 stars.

I would do so on a weekend night, because that seems to be when they bring out the best dishes. \n\nOriginal:\n \nThis used to be Star East Buffet, but reopened about 2 weeks ago.  What can I say?  It's your typical Chinese buffet, but without snow crab legs, at least on the night that I went.  They do offer steamed sea bass, which was quite deliciously flavored with ginger, scallion, soy, and sesame oil.   The sushi wasn't too good, and they had a very limited offering of nigiri, sadly.  I was able to request a spicy tuna roll, though.  The salmon wasn't the freshest, either.  There is a small hibachi station next to the sushi arena, and you can get a custom-made stir fry, but honestly, if you want a REAL stir-fry go to International Buffet in Bustleton, not here.  The salad buffet was very clean, and they do offer a generous variety of cold salads, including pasta and chicken based ones.  Probably my favorite item was shrimp dumplings, although only a few are brought out every 15-20 min.  In terms of the hot entrees, they are your typical take-out dishes, and none truly stood out in either direction.  The crystal dumplings filled with mung bean custard were amazing - you have to try them!  I'll probably head back and get a box of those to go.  \n\nOverall, not somewhere I would go to, save in forced situations.   The prices are a bit cheaper than King Buffet, but it is not its competition, by any stretch.  They were offering a 20% discount, and have ads in Clipper.

The bisque was delicious: creamy and savory with a hint of fennel and perhaps truffle (I think?).  Anyhow, whatever the exact flavors were, they meshed well and made for a very good soup.  The croissant was buttery and flaky, although it wasn't amazing; The Little Chef in Princeton still holds the crown for best croissants.  They do bake them on the premises here every day and you can definitely taste the difference, though (not a fan of mass-produced supermarket croissants).  It also comes with a side of pecan butter, which was quite possibly the most delectable spread ever.  It was a nice change from the typical cinnamon butter and just so creamy with a perfect balance of pecan and the butter's inherent flavor.  It almost made me want to get another croissant just so I could finish it.  But then I would have been brought more butter and gluttony would have taken over.  So I desisted...with much restraint on my part.

The staff are fiendly but they seem very rushed as it was quite busy and there were only 2-3 waiters in the entire restaurant serving all the tables and taking takeout orders as well. \n\nCash and Venmo only!\n\nA recap of the dishes:\n1. Sweet osmanthus and sesame mochi dumpling soup: This was perfectly light, sweet, and refreshing with thin shreds of osmanthus and egg whites.  The dumplings were fluffy and filled with sesame.  They are smaller than normal but each was  perfectly balanced bite of filling to shell.\n2. Crabmeat and pork soup dumplings: These were kind of meh with a thick shell and barely any soup and filling.  Maybe it was an off-day but I would suggest the other pan-fried options instead.\n3. Pan Fried buns: These were better than the soup dumplings but the filling was pretty sparse and definitely could have been more generous in portion.  4. Pan fried dumplings: These were solid with a plump, juicy filling and nicely crispy pan fried shell.\n5. Chive buns: Nice nd crispy with a flavorful egg and chive filling.  The only thing that would have made them better would have been some vemicelli inside but pretty solid overall.\n6. Stir-fried clams: Pretty flavorful clams albeit small ones.  It's a bit on the salty side but still pretty solid.\n7. Plum spare ribs: Fried sweet spareribs with sweet plums.  Overall, a nice appetizer-sized option (the ribs are small).  The meat is flavorful and pretty tender but the dish itself is not very filling so this is more of a starter vs an actual main entree.\n8. Seafood tofu casserole: Mostly light silkn tofu with 3 prawns, some fishballs, and 3 pieces of surimi.  This is very light but the seafood portion was tiny.  The nice part is that it isn't oily at all but it's definitely not your traditional seafood hot pot.\n9. Seafood udon: Stir fried udon with seafood in a traditional brown oyster-soy.  This was pretty standard but it was branded as a Shanghai stir fried thick noodle and it resembled more of a Japanese stir-fried udon.  It was just okay but a bit salty.\n10. Marinated sliced roast beef: This was just okay.  The beef was tender but slightly dry and didn't have that sweet and savaory marinade that is the hallmark of the 5-spice Shanghainese beef.\n11. Seasonal stir-fried vegetables: This was light and refeshing and surprisngly one of the best dishes with sliced lotus, cauliflower, broccoli, snow peas, mushrooms, woodear, carrots, and asparagus.  There was just a very slight coagulation of the corn starch thickener on some pieces but they were very busy tonight and likely understaffed in the kitchen so they were likely making this in a rush.", "date": "2021-05-31 03:45:43"}, {"_key": "819065", "_id": "reviews/819065", "_rev": "_fNysYWm--X", "review_id": "xrotHXt19_3T3yFqbPabzg", "user_id": "ouODopBKF3AqfCkuQEnrDg", "business_id": "bFO_XYnYMDF1GMY9LK3oxQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "The king salmon here is just simply delectable: the meat is moist, flaky, and flavorful.

I highly recommend ordering a few pounds so that you always have a good, healthy meal option on hand.

The duck was just okay and the portion was a bit on the small side, but that may be a good thing considering that duck isn't exactly the most cholesterol-friendly poultry meat.  I liked the slow cooked leg more than the breast since the flavor was icily imbued throughout, whereas the breast was a bit bland in the innermost section.  It wasn't bad for a chain but I would definitely get my duck fix at Margaret Kuo, Sangkee, or New East.  The Shanghai shrimp dish was very solid, with tender shrimp, plenty of veggies, and a light yet flavorful garlic sauce.

The Fox was one of the first theaters that showed \"talkies\" and is so magnificent that if it were to be built today, estimates range in the hundreds of millions for construction.\n\nTours are given on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays at 10:30am, and believe it or not, the tour will last for 90 minutes!  I recommend the Saturday one as that is when you will likely here the grand Wurlitzer organ under the stage rock the house.

(http://www.fabulousfox.com/StanKann.aspx)\n\nI took the tour on a Thursday, learned a lot about a St. Louis landmark, went backstage where many St. Louis natives have never even gone, and got to experience the beauty of this theater, which is designed, in its reaching towards a lovely ball chandelier, to look like a giant tent (continuing the Siamese theme).

Thankfully, I am not alone in my willingness to drive long distances for the prospect of amazing ice cream. With a three car caravan in place we decided to make a day of it, stopping first outside Baltimore at G&M for crab cakes and then heading on to Woodside for ice cream. As soon as we pulled onto the road that Woodside Farm sits on I was sure the drive had been worth it. The trees, the cooler-than-DC weather, the pastoral scene with the grazing cows - this was definitely what I'd envisioned.\n\nWe were welcomed warmly by friendly ice cream scoopers Karla, Bridget, Meghann and Sandra who upon finding out we had driven all the way from DC for their ice cream agreed to allow us unlimited tastings. If you know yelpers, you know we took advantage of their generosity tasting cake batter, motor oil, orange honey blossom, butter brickle, chocolate thunder and more! Let's just say I feel very qualified to write this review with so many samples!\n\nIn the end I got two cones. I took things slow starting with a scoop of chocolate peanut butter on a sugar cone. It was the perfect balance of chocolate and peanut butter and in my opinion a must try for anyone who loves this combination. I then went back for mango sorbet, coconut and banana on a waffle cone. That might've been a bit overkill in retrospect but hey - we'd driven over 100 miles to get there!\n\nWoodside Farm is an ideal en route stop on your way from Washington, DC to New York as it's right on the way.

Look no further then Cold Spring Tavern. CST is hidden in the mountains about twenty minutes from Santa Barbara. To get there you have to take old highway 154 and then a little windy road called Stage Coach Road. The restaurant is nestled in the mountain side and is shaded by huge trees. You can't even see the place from the highway. CST actually consists of two buildings. One is a restaurant and the other is a small bar. CST looks like an old log cabin inside and out. The inside has lots of little tables that are lit by candle light, two fireplaces, and lots of old pictures on the walls. \n\nThe food here is great. They serve quite a few different types of meat. Anything from steak to pork ribs to venison and even buffalo. They also have an amazing chili. I always get the sampler which will let you try three small bowls of their great tasting chilis. My favorite thing on the menu though is an appetizer. It is the mushroom caps filled with venison. The way the venison and the mushroom taste when combined is fantastic. \n\nThe best day of the week to go though is on Sundays. On Sunday they have a guy come down and set up a BBQ outside the restaurant and serve up the world best tri-tip sandwiches. The chef is a big friendly guy who has been doing this BBQ every Sunday for as far back as I can remember. His sandwiches are too die for. The best thing is that he is not stingy when it comes to the meat. He packs those rolls full of the juiciest tri-tip you will ever taste. To put on the sandwich he has three different types of condiments. The first is salsa, the second is a great tasting sweet BBQ sauce and the third is an amazing apple horseradish. \n\nThe service here is stellar. The people who work in the restaurant are all really nice. On Sundays when the BBQ is going on the place will get really crowded. Mostly by bikers and tourist. If you're a fan of motorcycles then I would recommend going down one Sunday. You will see all makes and models of different bikes. Also on Sundays they have bands play outside of the bar for you to enjoy will you eat your tri-tip sandwiches. \n\nThe restaurant itself is a little pricy but well worth the money for the experience you are sure to have.

I really loved the location of this hotel. It was walking distance to nearly everything Philly had to offer. We're pretty much in between the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Reading Terminal. So you can walk one direction towards the Museum  and go through Ben Franklin Parkway and through the Rodin Museum and near towards Eastern State Penitentiary or towards Reading Terminal which will lead you close to the Liberty Bell and other touristy sites.\n\nUpon arrival, we had the valet take our car. They offer a in and out service which was very convenient for us. It allowed us to take the car out at night and see some the sites and hit up Pat's Steaks. The checking in process here is a breeze. The concierge was really friendly and helpful. There were a few things I disliked about the hotel. One would have to be their elevators. They have 3 elevators but they were all so slow! My second was their bathroom. The toilet seat was loose and the sink counter and cabinet below was dirty. I had to wipe everything down with disinfectant wipes. Everything else was pretty spot on. The beds were a bit small but it was bearable. The rooftop pool was nothing luxurious but for what it is, it worked. It wasn't crowded, they had fresh towels on hand and plenty of seating. Beverages weren't allowed at the pool site. The views were pretty nice.\n\nVerdict - I would definitely come back to Windsor Suites if I were to visit Philly again in the future. I would just suggest to the management and housekeeping to make sure the toilet seats are on tight so that they don't wobble or break loose every time you sit down. And I hope in the future, the dust and dirt that was all over the sink cabinet would be gone. The value and price you pay is definitely worth it since you're getting a suite. Kitchen is kinda small, water and coffee are complimentary but I wouldn't recommend using their coffee machine. It is filthy! We ran water through it, and the hot water it produced was utterly disgusting! The closets were plentiful spacious. Our view was okay, 10th floor view of other high rise buildings.

Just to make a clear note, I did not research on what's good and what to avoid at Reading Terminal before my trip. The only spot I was aware of was Bassetts. \n\nAs I wandered around the terminal aisles, I saw a sign that said \"Cajun\". I immediately speed walked my way over and peaked through their menu and saw some gator. I never had any kind of gumbo in my life, nor have I had gator. I figured, this would be the right place and time to try. 1 order of gator gumbo over rice and it was by far one of the tastiest things I've ever tasted in my life.\n\nThe gator meat. I'm not 100% sure if it's actually gator but it tasted darn good. It seemed like they made gator sausages out of them and chopped them into pieces and cooked them in the gumbo. The cajun spices in the gumbo was magnificent. It was not flamethrower spicy, it had a nice kick and it went down just fine with the white rice. It was absolutely delicious and I regret not ordering a second bowl.\n\nVerdict - Something this good is worth trying. Some may be discouraged because of the gator meat but trust me, just pretend you didn't hear the word \"gator\" and you'll love it. After trying other vendors in Reading Terminal, when it comes to hot food, I choose Beck's Cajun Cafe over everything else I've tried.

They have a few select IPA's on special and their mango mojitos were amazing. We ordered a sizzling grilled chicken fajita and Pan de Lechon which consist of roast pork, mojo cilantro mayonnaise and grilled onions on pressed Cuban bread. The roast pork sandwich was very juicy and tender. The cilantro mayonnaise along with the onions went really well on that toasty Cuban bread. As for the fajitas, they sure came out sizzling. Many other patrons ordered it because it smelled so good whenever the waiter passed by with it. It was really worth it. Served with grilled onions, bell peppers, rice and beans, guacamole, sour cream and warm tortillas. It was very filling and one of these best things to eat in all of Main Street in New Hope.\n\nVerdict - Mojito Cuba Caribe is a nice cozy fancy little joint.

Don't get me wrong DiNic's is still on my favorite list, just Beck's has been my top goto spot whenever I'm in Philly.\n\nThe gator gumbo in my opinion is always a must. Don't think too much about the gator. It's more like a pork sausage if anything since it does contain pork. But the gumbo itself is savory and full of robust flavors mixed with plain rice or jambalaya, it's a delicious combination.\n\nI ordered just a gator sausage on a stick. It seemed pretty good because my dad hogged it! Guy didn't even share one piece. He kept dunking the sausage into their mustard and finished it within seconds so it must be good.\n\nThe train wreck po'boy was a first for me. Prior to this visit, we've only come to Beck's for their gator gumbo and fried Mac and cheese. I wanted something different this time so I gave the po'boy a shot and it did not disappoint. The hoagie for one was probably a better hoagie than most sandwiches spots I've been to in Philly. The taste and juiciness of the meat and ingredients inside was like an explosive orgasm in your mouth. It's not a sandwich that you need to rush and eat before it gets cold. Take your time with this one because it likes it slow. Comparing this sandwich to DiNic's, you have to rush to eat the roast pork sandwich at DiNic's because that sandwich taste like crap when it gets cold and dried up.\n\nVerdict - It's probably no secret to folks who goto Reading Terminal regularly.

I didn't see the arugula, but the gorgonzola and onions were in perfect proportion with the beef.\n\nThe challenge with this rare of a burger is the bun gets soaked with juices when you put any pressure on the sandwich.

That's when the bun gets in the way and becomes superfluous.\n\nThe menu didn't say how big THE BURGER is, but I'd suggest it was into hefty ouncedom.\n\nThe salad.

The alfredo was a rich cream sauce tossed with wide noodles. It was spectacularly delicious.

I believe I saw (and ate) one little caper.\n\nMy dish came with garlic mashed potatoes or spaghetti (olive oil, red or white sauce -- I chose white) and a zucchini-squash-red onion medley. It's really an entire meal for $19. And it's nice that sides are included (two, to boot) with the entree.\n\nThe spaghetti white sauce was flavorful, and the vegetable medley was well-seasoned and not over-cooked.\n\nWe did get the lovely bread basket of yeasty, doughy pretzel rolls, which were fabulous. I took two home.\n\nWe both left with wonderful to-go vessels. Mine's probably a hefty dinner for tomorrow. Hers is probably a nice-portioned lunch, with a nap apr\u00e8s.\n\nWhat I don't get is how the Groupon is apportioned. We were allowed $13 for an appetizer (ours was $12), $7 apiece for two beverages (which we got) and $23 apiece for entrees.\n\nHer entree cost $18. Mine cost $19. That's $37 for an allowance of $46. So we should have had an extra $10 (add $1 for the appetizer differential).\n\nBut when we got an extra glass of wine (not both of us) for $7, it didn't balance against the leftover money from the appetizer and entrees.\n\nIt did last time.

I recently stayed at the hotel next door and the check in clerk said he would recommend the Philly Diner over the Denny's a few steps further. Since it was late and dark and this being not the best of areas , I opted for the Philly Diner. Upon entering I questioned my decision. There must have been no more than 4 people dining, in the weirdly lit , almost gray? quiet diner. There were more young wait staff than patrons, and they were sitting in various booths behind the cash register on their phones seemingly uninterested in my being there , standing waiting to place a to-go order. Yeah. I should have left after a good 5 minute stand where one guy told a waitress in the kitchen to come do my order. I waited another 3-5 minutes . WHY do I do that ?! This lady comes out, NO hello, she just stood and looked at me .. so I placed my order. Then she moves 20 feet with her back to me ... I don't know whether to follow her or stay put! She then says in a unfriendly, almost barking manner over her shoulder, 'I'll ring you up over here' .. and shakes her head at me. Yeah , because I read minds? Off she disappears to the kitchen again. A few minutes later what appears to be the owner or manager comes out and he greets me and asks if I am okay. Well, that is better! BUT then proceeds to argue with the young staff about who is off and who is staying to work. They argue back. This is actually getting humorous. The grumpy older lady appears with my food , and I ask about utinsels since I am in a hotel room. She snaps , ' I always put those in first!' Simmer down , sister. It's a basic question. \nThe food: It was actually very good. I had a Turkey Melt and switched the cheese up. It was hot, seemingly fresh, and an ample serving that I could not finish.\nIt gets a 2 star because customer service is important. This place has so much potential and just fails in professionalism. That alone makes my return factor, meh. \nKnow going in, that you will wait; possibly not be waited on , because what is on those waiters smart phones is clearly more important than doing the job you were hired to do; and when waited on, it may be nice or it may be the ' YOU are disturbing me!' factor. \nNo. Thanks.", "date": "2015-05-24 04:25:57"}, {"_key": "544862", "_id": "reviews/544862", "_rev": "_fNysQHy--M", "review_id": "yrqA1ztUY0BnQGWpJp_fIQ", "user_id": "1sGYXSkJHPhJ6wQtc-RbZw", "business_id": "cB_9eHHfo9me96cZup-lZQ", "stars": 3, "useful": 17, "funny": 7, "cool": 5, "text": "The Saint has a great few things going for it.

Wanting to go off of our resort for one night and enjoy one of our favorite foods/meals , we were lead to Le Rendezvous. Because we were staying at our wedding venue on Starr Pass, and were likely to have wine, we took an Uber. For a few minutes, I wondered where we were headed, but the lengthy trip was worth it! We were warmly greeted and seated in the dining room upon our arrival. The dining room is small and quaint and the Rat Pack crooned over the sound system adding a nice ambience. It was, our wedding reception music, after all!! Did they know?! There is a Yelp check in offer for a gratis glass of wine , but we opted for a French 75. This classic lemony martini topped with champagne was handshaken at our table.. the extra left in the martini shaker for us. Nice! I would not come close to finishing this drink and I knew pretty quickly that if I tried, I would be done. It was good, but it packed a punch!! The wine list, primarily French wines from all the various regions in France, was impressive! I spent several minutes trying to decide what would be my wine for dinner! Our server, was so gracious and friendly .. he knew the menu backwards and forwards and recommended dishes and wine to me when I was hung up on what to order. The menu is classic French but was missing Foie Gras, which I love ! He excused himself for a second and asked the chef if they could grant my wish: Voila! Wish granted! I ended up not going with the foie gras, after all of that, as my main was a Beef Wellington, which is rich and wrapped in foie gras. Can I ever just make my mind up ?! I started with the Salade de Epinard: a spinach Salad with carmelized sweet onions, ch\u00e8vre , perfect crisps of lardons amongst the perfect Dijon vinagrette.. THIS could have been my main! I was quickly taken back to Cafe du Trocadero in Paris where I had this salad all the time ! My husband ordered the pate to start. This starter was a tremendous amount of pate! So rich and filling ! He also had the Gratin du Oignon, a steaming rich , bubbling gratin of French onion soup that was bubbling with delightful Guyere cheese on top. Next we both opted for the Beef Wellington. This isn't a dish that is often offered on menus and I've only seen it once , maybe?, in Phoenix .. so it's a treat, when prepared correctly. This Beef Wellington was an ample serving of filet , tucked amidst foie gras and baked rare within a perfect , flaky warm crust that was melt in your mouth heaven! Our dishes were served with crisp yet tender pomme des Annas, potatoes that were just perfectly crisp and seasoned and also vegetables to balance the meal. This Beef Wellington was outstanding and perfectly prepared! There was so much of it, and it's so rich , there was no way either of us could complete our meals. This wasn't your typical upscale meal, where the food is all about looking decorative and not a lot to eat; NO! These portions were a lot for a French , upscale restaurant! Next came out dessert, the waiter brought us a Grand Marnier Souffl\u00e9 to share for our anniversary celebration ! The concierge at our wedding resort must have set that up! Literally, I've never seen a souffl\u00e9 so puffy and perfect! It came with Chantilly Creme and again... so very French! This meal was one of my husbands and my favorites likely for the year... and as you can see from my reviews, we travel and we eat a lot!! I can't say enough about Le Rendezvous and how amazing the food was here! The entire experience was almost as perfect as it could be outside of France... even the waiter snapping at his helper was authentic! ( Yes! We could hear that from our table 'number 2' !! :-) ) Finding good , VERY good French food in Arizona is hard.. this is the place!

We found ourselves here after waiting to check in at the Hilton on St. Charles Avenue just in time. Luke quickly filled up and at one time was 3 deep behind our coveted bar spot with patrons trying to get drink and 75 cent oyster orders in. Happy Hour runs from 3-6pm ; all specialty cocktails , wines and beers ate half off! It's a great time to sample a drink you may have been wanting to try, like the Sazerac or French 75, both N'awlins 'native' 'must try once drinks'. I love the French 75 here; unlike some other establishments, Luke creates this special concoction with no gin, just enough lemonade, atop a small cherry, bitters and champagne.. the attentive bartenders even swirl a ' 75' or a pink heart atop the goodness. We made this our go to hh spot during our week in Nola. Can't find a place at the bar, no worries, you can enjoy the great hh prices from a table; another rarity. Great cappuccinos, which the bartender even suggested I try a smooth shot of a liquor called 43 / Cuarenta y Tres with: SOLD. We sampled bubbles including a nice Pinot Noir bubbly from France. We opted for dinner here one night , as well. I highly recommend reservations because the place gets packed and seemed to stay that way. For dinner I had the crab bisque , the best I've had in Nola , believe it or not. I say that , because I like the bisque to have pieces of crab throughout, and this one did. For my entree, I had the ribeye with maitre de butter and topped with crab. The ribeye was tender, but fatty. The waiter offered to take it back , but I did love the flavor and ribeye is not a filet! It was good, so no need to take it away! A wonderful warm bread comes with the meal and the ambience is old French bistro and lively.

On that note, it wasn't the worst experience I have had.\n\nWe made a reservation via a discount travel site for a night's stay last Wed. We were hitting up a show at the Amphitheater so it's a perfect location since it's literally a hop away.\n\nSince the concert started early and we were driving from Orlando, we called the day before to confirm an early check-in and were told \"sure, just arrive at noon and you will not have to wait more than an hour to check-in, there are tons of rooms available\" so we thought we were good to go. Cut to the next day at noon when we arrive in the lobby and are told \"Our system is down for maintenance so we can not currently check anyone in.\" Really? So it's routine maintenance and you didn't know this was going to happen yesterday? Fail. So we were told to wait an hour, which was reasonable... we will just go lay by the pool and relax... OH WAIT... The pool is under construction FOR THREE MONTHS. WHAT? Who fixes their pool in FLORIDA in SUMMER??? Huge fail. And on top of that, since we booked through another site, we did not receive the note that the pool was closed, which I think is also the hotel's fault for not making sure it was clearly stated. Also, when we called to get early check-in, they didn't note the pool closure. \n\nWell, one hour, ok, we will go grab a drink, check-in an hour later, we are told it will be at least another hour, so, being so passionate about customer service, I approached the third, yes third employee to discuss the situation and I request a Manager so I don't have to keep repeating what we have been through communication wise. The manager was clearly un-phased and did not offer anything to compensate for our terrible experience. Think about when you are stuck at an airport for a layover and they offer meal vouchers, nope not here. Not even a drink voucher. \n\nThen we check in again... YES, almost 4 hours we had to wait... so by this time it was regular check-in time of 4 pm... are you serious??? We asked for an upgrade since we waited so long, nope, just told \"no.\" Jessica R was with me and she took the time to call home office and request that corporate be aware of the situation and she was assured they would contact the hotel. We never heard anything about it during our stay. Another customer service fail. \n\nSo beyond the terrible customer service, which they had various times to try and recover from, the stay wasn't all that bad. Yes, there is smoke EVERYWHERE but it's an old person mecca because of the gambling and lack of nightlife in the area. \n\nThe room was very nice but had a horrendous view, just the roof of a part of the hotel. The beds were very comfortable and a lovely tub. Other than that, pretty normal. \n\nI am still so underwhelmed due to the customer service and no huge selling points. Bad customer service makes me so sad. \n\nIf I ever feel the need to stay at a Hard Rock Hotel in the near future, I am heading to the one is Fort Lauderdale!!!

To start, our table had the grilled 3 meat ravioli, fish sticks with mushrooms and sauteed melon, cheese plate, and summer vegetables. All of the appetizers were excellent, but my summer vegetables really stood out. They were fresh and had an excellent white wine sauce that was to die for... it was a little bit sweet and complemented the veggies perfectly. Great start!!\n\nFor entrees, the meatballs with potato gnocchi and salad were the hit of the table. But again, I was partial to my pork dish. It had veggies with a pork tomato reduction.. so great. It was rich (I believe it sat on a piece of pork belly) but cooked perfectly and the flavor was like a party in my mouth! The other entree was the Tayst take on chicken and waffles. Even though I am a Southern girl, I'm not much for meat and three style cooking. I know, blasphemy. But I feel that the butter and grease takes over and there is no flavor in most meat and three type dishes. However, these chicken and waffles were off the chart. It came with roasted watermelon and the waffle was savory and made with chicken in the batter. Crazy, huh?? Crazy delicious. \n\nAfter all that amazingness we got to try dessert and all of them were top notch. The s'more dessert was exceptional, my creme brule was different than your typical selection. It was rich and they had added a small line of raspberry sauce to give you a bit of a tartness with the sweet. Excellent! We also tried the cobbler and a vegan ice cream made with coconut milk! All of them were superb, but the table favorite was the s'mores, even though I still preferred mine :) You can't mess with perfection!!\n\nI'm giving them 4 stars because they were out of THREE of the wines that we selected for the table.

First, you have to order at the bar or window connected to the outdoor space. I definitely had more luck at the bar, but just come here planning to wait to order. That alone isn't a dealbreaker though. I'm fine to wait if I'm getting some interesting drinks and delicious food. Unfortunately Pearl Diver didn't deliver there either. While the port to port cocktail was delicious, it only tasted like fruit juice and was very weak. If I'm paying $12 I want it to taste like an adult beverage. I tried the Paloma later and it was better but also very weak and mostly ice. I was excited about the food but bummed when the mushroom and shishito peppers came out with a laughable amount. There were seriously 5 of them on a skewer and the mushrooms were a huge let down and not worth $9 for these items. Luckily the dumplings and dipping sauce were good so it wasn't a total waste. \nAt the end of our night we enjoyed talking to the bartender and sampled a shot of the daiquiri which was delicious and what I should have ordered instead of the other fruit heavy beverages I sampled.

You know the main spirit (whiskey, vodka, rum, etc) but for example they don't tell you that a gin cocktail is really a gin martini. No thanks. So be sure to ask your waiter to describe the drink for you in detail. They also offer a more expensive cocktail menu with premium spirits if that's your thing. \nFor dinner we had the risotto to start with walnuts, apple, goat cheese and butternut squash. It was very good but not a large portion which is good before a big meal. I would recommend more than one if you are splitting it amongst a group of 4 or more. \nFor entrees I had the roasted duck breast with cranberry stuffing and it was some of the best duck I've had in my life and the best stuffing I've had ever.

They were warm and flavorful and stuffed with a blend of what I think was shrimp and other seasonings. It's hard to describe, but just get them. We also had the dan dan shishito peppers which I have to order whenever they are on a menu and were very good. I think my favorite dish of the night was the spicy crab noodles.

So if you are a meat head and love it... maybe I'm not your best review to read. However, I will continue with that disclaimer! \n\nThis was my first time ever being at a Brazilian steakhouse, but I knew the standard; price fix menu and unlimited supply of food. To be honest, I have never had a desire to eat at one of these restaurants, but as it was someone's birthday I came along for dinner. \n\nThere are two options; full rodizio with unlimited meat and salad bar for $32.99 or salad bar only for $18.99. Multiple people have told me this is a great deal as most Brazilian Steakhouses are around $50 per person. \n\nAfter taking a look at the salad bar and seeing all of the food available, I went with the salad bar only and it was PLENTY of food. I enjoyed it; they offered hot dishes and cold ones as well with some hits and misses, but overall pretty decent. I snuck a bite or two of meat from my boyfriend's plate and it was tasty, but I didn't find myself upset that I missed out on it to be honest... some feedback from the table who did partake in the meat selections said that there were some cuts of meat that were amazing, others were a bit tough. They also are pretty good about cutting off big pieces if you want that. \n\nI did get a bit frustrated having to say \"no thanks\" over and over again to the gauchos who were bringing by meat. It was better once we told our server that I was only eating the salad bar, but I still had to say \"no thanks\" again and again. One of them it must have been his first day because he didn't have hardly ANY muscle in cutting the meat and had some difficulty getting pieces off. \n\nSo you see my dilemma... $18.99 is a bit steep in my opinion for a salad/hot bar only, but it was good. It's nice to have the option to opt out of the full experience if you are trying to save some money or have dietary restrictions. I think vegans are a bit screwed....just don't come here if you are vegan period! \n\nI keep going back and forth between 3 and 4 stars but I think I have to go with my gut and give them a 3..

It's also surprisingly quite clean as well due to the constant moving waters.

Pick-up at your hotel is relatively easy and the driver will spend some time gathering the rest of attendees. Along the way, the bus driver may keep you entertained with stories about the city. It was so interesting to see and learn about the remaining effects of Hurricane Katrina as we left New Orleans. When you get to the swamp site, you'll check-in and then wait to be called in groups. Then, you board your designated boat and it's away you go for about an hour and a half. \n\nThe tour itself really gives you an appreciation of the unique landscape the state of Louisiana is situated on. It doesn't get any closer to nature and the tour guide will take you around the marshland, swamp and even the bayou. Of course, we saw plenty of gators swim up to our boat and we were able to get plenty of cool shots as our tour guide fed them marshmallows and hot dogs from a stick.

Google showed me that it wasn't the contestant I'd been thinking of, but I was still curious enough to want to try the place. The wait was close to 45 minutes as estimated, and we eventually got a small table by the window. For lack of supply our table wasn't equipped with the same set of hot sauces as the neighboring tables. Margarita flavors of the day were strawberry or mango, and a pitcher of the latter pleasantly sloshed us by the end of dinner.\n\nI was sad to see that their menu online hadn't been updated with the recent changes. While I understand that it's a pain to keep stock for a vegetarian ingredient that isn't present in any other dishes, I'd been really looking forward to the cactus and sweet potato burrito. Which reminds me, I haven't seen a neighborhood so vegetarian-friendly in a long time. John was gung-ho about what appetizers we were going to get, so I let him take charge of those while I picked out our entrees. Given the amount of food we were about to indulge in, we opted to pass on the endless chips and salsa. As strongly as his roommate recommended the barbecue, I was pretty realistic about our consumption of food and chalked the pork belly off for a later visit.\n\nI've never seen fried pickle chips cut so thick (a hefty quarter-inch), and the texture was right on the border between cuke and pickle. The spicy chili mayo it came with was an okay pairing, nothing special. Of everything on our table it was the least spectacular, and as a result it was the only thing we left unfinished.\n\nThe single order of veggie wings with ranch sauce arrived at the same time as the other app. Celery and carrot sticks were acceptably fresh, though the celery was the lower quality of the two. The seitan was sliced thin and fried to crisps before tossed in buffalo wing sauce. An interesting plate that I was content to eat, but definitely takes an open-minded palate to appreciate. Not sure that I'd get this again, but I'd be tempted to make this at home if I went herbivore.\n\nSince the shrimp and chorizo burritos each came as a pair, we traded our spares to share the entree experience. The radish slices were nice to have, but I was unimpressed by the jicama cabbage slaw. I think my main criticism is that the tortillas tasted straight out of the package. I would've enjoyed each bite more had an attempt been made to lightly grill the wrappers. The chorizo was my favorite of the two; instead of pineapple, it's now served with roasted red potatoes that give it a fantastic rustic flavor. The wedge lime lightened the heaviness of the burrito, and I could totally picture this as an amazing breakfast burrito if scrambled egg were included. The shrimp burrito tasted of very fresh ingredients, but citrus wasn't present enough to make the seafood really pop. Sadly, this made the room-temperature tortilla overwhelm the light flavor of the shrimp.\n\nService was friendly enough to come by to top off our glasses for us despite the packed crowd and the pitcher being right there for our own dispensation. Two bathrooms behind the ATM/cigarette machines, surprisingly clean and tagged with random graffiti that actually fits right in with the feel of the place.

With how late we started our day, we and other groups ended up waiting down the street at another establishment until the seating host radioed in that our table was ready. Loved the warmth of the sun through the window at my back.\n\nFried green tomatoes were recommended by one of the bartenders from the night before, so John and I ordered a plate to share around the table. Even our resident anti-tomatoite Kevin found them unoffensive, since they tasted like the fried batter more than the tomatoes themselves. The bed of unwilted organic salad greens served to help drain the residual fryer grease.\n\nThe others were content with their food: Julie's two eggs over easy with a biscuit, Ginny's breakfast quesadilla with tofu instead of ham, John's three egg omelet with chorizo, tomato, and cheddar, and Kevin's two giant buttermilk pancakes with bananas and peanut butter chips, plus turkey bacon. I was most jealous of Kevin's plate, largely from my astonishment that each pancake was the size of my head. Thankfully they took it easy on the powdered sugar.\n\nMultiple latkes were ordered and I personally found them just shy of inedible. Potato dominated in texture, and the overall flavor was overwhelmed by the oil they were fried in. I generally enjoy a nice crunchy crust, but I felt that our batch was a bit too aggressively browned. I tried swiping it through the country gravy to improve the taste but eventually gave up on my latke. On the other hand I had no complaints about the full-sized PoBoy. The gently finessed chorizo omelette was folded into thirds. Instead of the traditional fixings, it's topped with a healthy ladling of creamy country gravy. I'm glad they saw fit to toast the open faces of the baguettes, since it kept the bread from getting overly soggy after inevitable gravy exposure. I also knife-and-forked this into manageable handling portions, but was ultimately defeated by the sheer volume of food in front of me.\n\nThree and a half stars. Service was friendly enough, though we had to flag them down by hand for beverage refills once we got our food. Bathrooms acceptably clean. Cash only but the ATM in the corner makes it convenient for the easily forgetful. Cozy diner feel matches the homey food. I feel like this was the Roscoe's of Philly for me. I listened to too much of the hype and ended up with the impression that it was only okay. The food portions are ridiculous, but nothing about my brunch here blew my mind. Clearly I should've gotten the recommended French toast, or Jeb's open-faced biscuit sandwich. Even the burgers I eyeballed at other tables looked tasty. I'd be open coming back here to eat through more of the menu.", "date": "2011-02-28 22:25:40"}, {"_key": "892606", "_id": "reviews/892606", "_rev": "_fNysahS--b", "review_id": "lhNpozCO0qKLjKSNFWx0iQ", "user_id": "M9puGD3VU5FuhE60HklCvg", "business_id": "xdZRBVs-bAJGn_IEFZAObA", "stars": 3, "useful": 2, "funny": 2, "cool": 1, "text": "The signs for \"Top 100 Chinese restaurants in America\" should probably include the fine print of \"...as voted by white people.\" Quiet location in a strip plaza with a full bar, family-friendly booth/table layout, and clean bathrooms.\n\nI was in the mood for mapotofu, double cooked pork, and duck. Instead, our friendly Malaysian server with great English insisted we wouldn't want to try any of those, but that the General Tso's chicken was \"their signature dish\" and perhaps the Hunan pork would be a suitable alternate protein dish. I stared at him in disbelief before caving, thinking it would be better to be underwhelmed than have food poisoning on the way back.\n\nComplimentary fried wonton noodles served with sweet and sour sauce. I somewhat regretted going for the roast Hunan pork, since the cuts were a bit dry. Vegetables used were fresh, where applicable. Chicken was garnished with steamed broccoli. Pork included snow peas, sliced carrot, baby corn, halved broccoli florets, chopped green bell pepper, button mushrooms, chopped onion, and garlic. Other than that, most things tasted of the generic brown sauce on both dishes.\n\nFresh rice, good pot of hot tea readily refilled upon request. Enough leftovers for lunch the next day.

New Orleans is packed with tourists, drunks, and misfits.  Every damn bar, every restaurant, good or bad, was packed.  No reservations.  All first come, first serve.  There was a line around 3 Muses like it was the hottest club in Manhattan.  We walked up to the hostess, where she proceeded to tell us that they weren't even taking anymore names.  We were both sorely disappointed.  All week we were looking forward to coming here.  It was the best food we had on our first trip to the city.\n\nAnyway...  \nWe walked away like 2 kids that just lost their pup.  We wandered around the open market across the street when The Man says, \"Hey.. Let's go back and see if we can get lucky.\"  I looked at him like, \"Are you out of your goddamned mind?!\"  Ugh...  but, I agreed.  I waited across the street while I watched him have a few words with the hostess.  He signals me to come over, and \"BAM!!\".  The hostess tell us to wait at the bar and have a drink and she'll call us when there was a table available.\n\nI fuckin love this man...\nWe walked over to the bar to order a couple of cocktails, and what happens???  2 bar stools open up right in front of us and we're in...  UNBELIEVABLE.\n\nThe food...\nStill the best damn food in NOLA.  The menu I noticed has changed so I won't go into details of what we ate because it'll probably change again but expect to be blown away by an explosion of flavors.  (make sure to get the lamb burgers) The chef certainly has a sweeter palate so, for some of you, you might not be so keen on a few of their plates, but I thought it was fucking fantastic.

As soon as I can.\n\nThe Man and I were strolling along in the French Quarter taking in all the sounds and smells of history.  The warm southern air makes time stand still.  We did a quick search for a casual place to rest our feet and feed on some local fare and found this gem called Three Muses.  The sounds of piano keys and voices led us in.  After being seated, we quickly ordered cocktails and a plethora of food.  It was amazing.  To have this kind of food at a gastropub, left me in awe.  Rosemary infused cashews, oysters, sliders, and everything you can imagine was all so incredibly delicious. \n\n\nThree Muses defined New Orleans for me.  Musicians playing with their hearts, great food prepared by people who care,strong, tasty cocktails in an unpretentious environment, relaxed people, smiling and enjoying the moment.

I have an unlimited tolerance for burgers and beers, and I'm always grateful when there's a new one around.  I have a very picky fiance, so gastropubs are always great fallback dinner options for Saturday nights when we haven't made dinner plans.  This is exactly how we ended up at Eureka! with our friends Tristan C. and Brian G.  We faced a bit of a wait for a table, but otherwise it was pretty hassle-free.\n\nI liked Eureka!  It was conveniently located in downtown Santa Barbara, right in the middle of the busy commercial strip.  There were a lot of people and the atmosphere was fun and bustling, with a little bit of a sports bar vibe.  There was a huge bar, and a huge chalkboard menu listing a nice selection of beer.  We got a table in the middle of the dining room, but we were never crowded.  Service was excellent.  Our waitress was very friendly and helpful.  I wish I'd gotten her name because she is a real asset to this restaurant.\n\nThe beer list was solid.  I drank a Cismontane Black's Dawn stout and a Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA, which I didn't know existed.  Both were great - the stout was a nice heavy coffee stout, and the 120 Minute IPA was strong but almost sweet.  It tasted almost like lychee.  Matt had a Davy Brown ale and the Dogfish Head 90 Minute, which we both like quite a lot.\n\nThe food was good, if not especially memorable.  The menu was very big, with a lot of tantalizing souped up options.  I had the Napa Burger, which came with pesto aioli, havarti cheese, fried pancetta, arugula, and an oven-roasted Roma tomato marinated in olive oil and vinegar.  The patty was juicy and decently flavorful, and I liked the gooey cheese and the bacon.  The tomato was not as wonderful as I'd hoped, but it was definitely good.  I also tried some of Matt's Cowboy Burger, which is the most popular one on the menu.  This was pretty tasty, with cheddar cheese, shoestring onion rings, crispy bacon, and homemade beer barbecue sauce.  It was trying less hard than the Napa Burger and it might have been better for it.  The barbecue sauce was excellent.  I got some as a condiment with my side, and it was really hearty and addictive with just the right amount of tang.  The sides were good - we had fat onion rings and some thin fries, both solid, crispy, deeply unhealthy options.\n\nEureka! isn't a spot I would go out of my way for, but if I lived nearby, I'd probably go pretty often.  We had a great time and the food and beer were both worthwhile.

Like me.\n\nI rented one of these cheesy charming vehicles with three friends, including my boyfriend, who was born and raised in Santa Barbara.  He was chastised by another native who said, \"They are the devil and you are not allowed.\"  Regardless, the four of us had a fantastic time getting passed on the sidewalk by all manner of children and old people walking and pedaling along the beach.\n\nThe rental process was quick and easy, and the price was a reasonable $36 per hour with a second hour free.  The staff was very friendly and kept everything pleasant.  We signed some waivers and disclaimers without reading, and were directed to stay on a swatch of bike path paralleling the ocean.  The path was sufficiently long but not at all strenuous, excellent news for a less than powerful surrey.\n\nThe ride was lovely, full of sun and sea breeze.

We definitely stayed past closing time, though, until around 3:00 or 3:30 every night. We sat on the sidewalk patio, where there was always an open table with wicker outdoor furniture, and around 1:30 or 2 or whenever, someone would come out to announce last call and then politely bring in the cushions and swap out our glassware for disposable cups. The staff was patient with us and prepared our many massive drink orders in a timely and competent manner (there was no table service late at night, but it was easy to get our drinks at the bar).\n\nThe space was nice, though the interior was kind of weird and flashy. I'm guessing Tryst is about as close you might get to a club in St. Pete, but it really wasn't that bad, especially on the patio. The only night it was sort of crowded was Saturday, and even then, it cleared out by like 1:30. The patio furniture was super comfortable, and after our first night, it got replaced with even nicer furniture. I hope it's not because we somehow ruined the first set. We're not that nasty, I don't think.\n\nDrinks were solid enough, an above basic bar selection with some local/regional draft beers and a broad choice of liquors.

The service is friendly and generous with the samples.  I tried a ton of flavors before getting the mini sampler, perhaps defeating part of the purpose of that sampler, and most of them were pretty great.\n\nAll of the ice cream has a wonderful tuggy consistency and a creamy richness.  The base ice cream is sold as its own \"naked\" flavor, and it's really good, milky and not too sweet.  I like that they're proud of their base, and the quality of the product shines through in every flavor.\n\nLike I said, I got six mini-scoops, which was a fair amount of ice cream but not too much, even coming off of two giant lunches.  For my six flavors, I chose creole cream cheese, red velvet, banana cane malt, coffee pecan brittle, peanut butter fudge, and Abita strawberry chocolate.   The creole cream cheese was my favorite, with a flavor like cream cheese but tangier, even a little bit sour.  The red velvet was so good and it actually tasted like the cake, rather than vanilla mixed with cake crumbs.  The banana cane malt tasted strongly of banana with an equally strong malty flavor, and the result was balanced and deep.  Coffee pecan brittle was as good as it sounds, nicely textured and very tasty.  Peanut butter fudge was a more adult flavor than you might imagine, very dense and dark with just a subtle layer of peanut butter.  The most out-there flavor was the Abita strawberry chocolate, and I would definitely recommend it.  Abita is the local Louisiana beer, and the flavor was prominent but mixed well with the strawberry and chocolate, both of which were also easily discernible.  My boyfriend got a scoop of the French vanilla, and this was a simpler flavor that was also quite good.  For some reason, it tasted vaguely of coconut.\n\nI swallowed my six little scoops with ease then crawled in the back of our rental car and lay down like a beached whale.
