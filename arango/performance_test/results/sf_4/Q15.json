I pulled up yelp and found this place. The reviews look good so we decided to try it. It was Thursday night around 9:00pm and a slightly chilly night so plenty of empty tables outside so figured we would have no wait. The hostess told us that they had calls out to other customers waiting for those tables and had to give them 15 minutes to show up. The thing is those customers put their names in an hour ago, don't think they are coming. So it was very frustrating we had to stand around waiting for 15 minutes when there were 5+ empty tables. This place would of been 4 stars otherwise. \n\nNow onto the drinks and food. We were trying to decide between two bottles of wine and the waitress kindly brought us out a taste of both. We went with Domain Gayda- 'Flying Solo' Grenache Blanc-Viognier and it was pretty reasonable in price at $36 for the bottle. \n\nThen we decided to share a few appetizers. We got the BRIE & CONFIT CROQUETTES, LOCAL SQUASH BRUSCHETTA and CRISPY PUMPKIN GNOCCHI. The LOVED the gnocchi. You could tell it was made fresh and the flavor was delicious. The Leek Hay on the bruschetta was different but tasty. The croquettes were good, though I think if the cheese was on the inside instead of on top it might of been better. \n\nAnd dessert was the real star of the night! We shared the chocolate tart. Our slice had to be at least 6 inches tall! And it had house made brittle on top.

We were staying in the Overland area, so we were looking for restaurants more centrally located, not downtown.  After reading several reviews, we settled on Pastaria in Clayton.   We arrived there around 6:30 on a Sunday evening and found street parking easily.  When we walked in, we realized that it was packed!  I was still on Tennessee time and so that felt like 7:30 to me and I was starving, so we grabbed the last two seats at the counter.  Kind of awkward and right on the end, but we loved it.  We had a great view of their wood fired oven and the stoves.  Watching the chef's work was fascinating.  I'm so glad that we didn't sit somewhere out in the restaurant!\n\nOur waitress, Tiffany, was excellent.  She answered all of our questions and took our order quickly.  My husband ordered the Wood Oven Roasted Chicken.   I ordered the Italian Ramen.  We split a mixed green salad.  They split the salad for us and it was perfect.  A nice spring greens mix with pears, walnuts and goat cheese.\n\nIt did take a while for us to get our food, but we didn't really mind.  We were watching the chef's work, the pizzas being made and of the goings on behind the counter.  We kept trying to guess which chicken in the oven was going to be my husbands.  When the food came, it was more than worth the wait.  My husband's chicken was fantastic.  It was a large chicken breast with part of the wing.  It was smokey with crisp skin, but still moist inside.  It was served with a bread salad of toasted bread, cucumbers, tomatoes and pickled red onions.\n\nMy Italian Ramen was incredible.  I could eat this every day for the rest of my life.  The broth was insanely rich and flavorful and almost thick from the grana padano cheese.  The ramen noodles, perfectly chewy and the chicken, smoky and tender.  Topped with a perfectly cooked soft egg and fresh basil.  I was going to try and get the runny egg yolk food porn shot, but I knew that once I put my spoon it it, I was going to be all about the eating, and not about the photos.  I want to try and make this at home.  It was like chicken noodle soup kicked up several hundred notches.\n\nNext time we go to St. Louis, it's going to be hard to stick to our only new restaurant rule, because this ramen is going to be calling to me.", "date": "2015-08-08 02:33:09"}, {"_key": "1000118", "_id": "reviews/1000118", "_rev": "_fNyryES--U", "review_id": "8ecQk7dxdopvA-Juuj57dw", "user_id": "VFp9AYShu_C9T4QsHpM3yA", "business_id": "P5wfVQb4kmADp-_4ux2E-Q", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "I just rode my bike to Cold Snap.

This place brims with potential, but it's not so close to living up to it. There are small things that left me ambivalent about SOHO. For one, the pizza options are definitely unique; however, they don't always pan out as excitingly as they do harmlessly waiting behind the converted deli case. The cheesesteak pizza, for example, isn't worth it. The cheese whiz on pizza was not what I anticipated, meaning it was kind of nauseating. My other complaint, just to clear the air, was that my pizza was lukewarm. They throw it in the oven for a few seconds to heat it up, but a solid minute or two was definitely in order for these slices. \n\nIt's a tough racket to open a pizza place. In Philly, there's one on every block. NYPD pizza, Old City Pizza, and every single Italian restaurant in the city come readily to mind. What SOHO has going for it is that it's at least different from the rest of the Market Street fare. What it needs is a staff that's a little better-trained (couldn't recommend the pizzas, just offered a generic 'everything's good') and a process to get the pizza to the right temp before dishing it out to customers. On top of that, they could reconsider the pizzas they sell by the slice. They're creative, I'll give them that, but I'd love to see that creativity go toward something better than their cheesesteak pizza or the mediocre buffalo chicken pizza. I was tempted, based on the sheer potential of the place, to give SOHO a 3-star review. If they really reconsidered how they went about it, spiced up their options and had a few more inviting faces behind the counter, this could even be a 4-star stopover in Old City worth a vist on occasion. Could be a standard if they raised their standards.", "date": "2013-01-04 19:45:56"}, {"_key": "1000834", "_id": "reviews/1000834", "_rev": "_fNyryFm--K", "review_id": "OxNY8RiQkY48z-SzZtsWUA", "user_id": "xRaI1T8xgNVuIDK3_nmOnA", "business_id": "vy0IlrE3Zl44HwxbsZhh2g", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I love the Ritz.

After a few bad experiences with New Century Travel and a horrible experience with the Bolt Bus, I'd almost given up on bus travel to NYC.  After reading all the awful reviews of Megabus, I was prepared for the worst.  Luckily everything was fine!\n\nWe took the 11:30am bus from Philly to NYC on Saturday (note: we didn't take it on the way back so can't comment on the NYC to Philly end of it).  We arrived about 10 minutes early.  It was easy to find and not confusing at all.  The Megabus boards right next to the Bolt Bus, west side of 30th St. Station and New York was the only bus boarding at the time.  Everyone was standing in an orderly line and we had no trouble finding 2 seats together.  And we got to ride on top of the double-decker bus...fun!\n\nWe left about 10 minutes after the scheduled departure time.  We got to NYC well past the 2pm (scheduled ETA was 1:30pm) due to traffic, but you can't fault them for that. I did not use the outlets or Wi-Fi, so I have no idea if they actually work.  One complaint is that it was COLD on that upper level.  I was wearing my winter coat, scarf and gloves and still felt the chill. \n\nUnlike the Bolt Bus, the seats are first come, first serve based on when you arrive to the bus, not how early you book your ticket.  I like that, as most of the time the trip is a last minute decision. I guess Megabus is hit or miss and I happened to have a 'hit' experience.

The bf doesn't like seafood and he liked the fact that the pasta did not taste \"seafood-y\".  The clams were great - good quality and clean (no sand/grit!).\n\n4) NY strip - cooked perfectly.

LOL, not every day! But skip lunch or something and have a great time eating a good loaf of bread.\nIn summary, excellent prices fabulous selection!

We really wanted to love this place. We arrived around 5:30 this evening and were sat upstairs in the dining room. It was super busy but it did take a good 10 minutes for the server to greet us.\n\nHaving never been there we had some questions about the menu. We felt very rushed by the server. I think it was only her and another server for the entire upstairs. We started with the boom boom shrimp. It was mediocre at best. The cauliflower that accompanied was much tastier. The shrimp was soggy and lacked flavor. For entrees we went with the ribs, trout and added sides of greens and brussel sprouts. The ribs were very good but came dry, not what I expected but they were good. We asked the server for bbq sauce. The fries while hand cut were a bit of a disappointment, they were cold and flavorless. The Cole slaw was some of the best I've ever had but there was barley any. The trout was very bland and boring. The gnocchi was the best part of that entree. The brussel sprouts that came it were shaved and good. The side of roasted brussel sprouts were cooked well, but again lacked seasoning. The greens were flavorful but bitter. We ended the meal with a brookie, half cookie and half brownie. It's hard to mess up dessert, it was spot on.\n\nOverall we left with mixed feelings. The ambiance of the place is on point! The bar is beautiful and you almost take a step back in time. The food and service leave a lot to be desired. The service was mediocre and the server seemed overwhelmed. We had to ask for refills etc. The food took a while to come out and it wasn't all that good.  Not sure if we would make the trip again. 2-3 stars but closer to 2..", "date": "2017-10-08 02:44:15"}, {"_key": "1001295", "_id": "reviews/1001295", "_rev": "_fNyryHG--C", "review_id": "XACxIHOyRE1LtQjSP4Y5cA", "user_id": "8JaJl5ZRMT4o2q10DVIZGg", "business_id": "zLuJ2IMuodpBjprqNUZjWg", "stars": 4, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "Sweet Olive (actually their name recently changed to Tempt) offered my group and I a wonderful experience, though the wait for the food were at times excruciating.  Let's start with the ambiance and decor: I loved it!  Ultra chic and modern with white and clear furniture and decor.  The restaurant is rather small and is separated from the rest of a hotel by long white curtains hanging from the ceiling.  The chandeliers and candelabras  above and on the tables were also a good touch.\n\nTempt offers a small menu, with only four appetizers, four entrees, and I believe four or five salads to choose from.  Since we had a group of 11, we decided to order all four of the apps to try.  Having 11 people, we were bound to have at least one of each entree offered.  The apps we ordered were the mussels, ravioli, the pork belly, and boudin balls.  The clear favorite was the pork belly.  For my entree, I ordered my personal New Orleans favorite, Shrimp and Grits!  The grits were creamy and the sauce flavorful with a generous amount of shrimp.  I enjoyed it, but it wasn't the best I've had in this wonderful city.  I also tried the other entrees:  I really enjoyed the honey glaze on the grilled chicken; the fish was also good, as was the Pork Chop.  I especially loved that it was topped with strawberries.  Everyone seemed to like their dish, bravo to that.  And of course, we had to get dessert!  We ordered the Mississippi Mud Pie, a Strawberry Cake, a Lemon Berry Tart, and and Berry dessert that I can't remember the name of.  If you're a chocolate lover, you should definitely steer towards the Mississippi Mud Pie.  It's pretty chocolatey and was a hit for all the chocolate lovers at the table.  Another favorite was the Lemon Berry Tart.  I'm a big lemon person, and if you add berries to that, it's pretty much heaven for me.  It was light refreshing, and I savored every bite of it!  The last two were just okay, I could have done without it.\n\nMy only complaint about Tempt would be how long the food took to come out!  It's a good thing we had time to spare, because it probably took an hour or almost an hour for our entrees to come out.  That's absurd considering the restaurant itself wasn't busy.  Something must have been going on in that kitchen.  Even our apps took a long while to come out.  We were starving by the time any of our food came out.  But other than this mishap, we all had a good meal.

They were also very nice about making sure I get what I want by asking me about my milk selection, whip cream, etc. since I did not specify anything. Even when they made me a smoothie, they offered to add more honey and make it a bit sweeter if I find it too sour without me mentioning anything.\n\nThe atmosphere here is also very relaxing. The music is just loud enough to hear but not too loud to drown out conversation or studying. There's plenty of seating including a few love seats also. The art on the walls are also very interesting. Every couple of months, they change the art so you get new stuff to look at all the time!

First of all, they have an enormous beer selection, with some great choices on tap, and their mixed drinks are prepared quite nicely.

But the room that used to house Agio's bar is like a big empty cavernous place with tables scattered around, a shuffleboard table and darts.  Plus the place is LOUD.  I mean, extremely loud -- nothing to muffle the noise of the crowd, TVs everywhere, plus music!\n\nAnd then there is the menu.  Nothing is priced over $10, but the selection is one of the strangest bar menus I have ever seen.  Props to them for not offering the same old things, but some of it is just  . . . weird.  For the salads, for example, they offer tabouli, barley, quinoa, cousous -- and a Caesar wedge.  Huh?  One of the main dishes consists of pulled lamb, chocolate bbq sauce, toasted almonds, aged white cheddar and craisins.  It's like they just keep going with the ingredients, then end up over a cliff.\n\nI ordered the 31st Mann, which was supposedly shaved prime rib, and a side of the fried veggie straws.  The beef was not shaved -- it was chunks of meat wrapped in a flat bread, and that was it.  And the veggies were  not straws -- they were also more like chunks.\n\nThet being said, the food was good. The wrap had nothing on it but beef, but the spicy mustard was excellent.  The veggie straws were good, although I never could discern exactly what the veggies were.

However, during April 2017 the local Gigi's locations came out in support of Sexual Assault Awareness Month by having a specific cupcake available, with teal sprinkles, where $.50 of each sale would benefit the Indiana Coalition to End Sexual Assault. As a sexual assault survivor myself and an advocate for others, this drew me into Gigi's and made me realize that their quiet, normal presence may be less showy than some other cupcake joints but they are consistently high in quality, pleasing in atmosphere and I absolutely love the people. \n\nThis location, which exists in that L-shaped strip center right behind the green David Wolf Bridge, is not a location I frequent as much as I should simply because it's not super convenient to the rest of my life. That said, occasionally it has become a destination area for me due to its proximity to the Fashion Mall and other area restaurants I enjoy. \n\nGigi's has both traditional and gluten free options, though it should be noted that flavors do vary from store to store. Gigi's is a national chain - Indiana has locations in Indy, Fishers, Granger/South Bend, Lafayette and Westfield. They do cupcakes for virtually all special occasions and even have a wedding planner on staff. Prices are consistent with most area cupcake joints - my experience has shown the cupcakes to maybe be a touch smaller than one or two of the other area major cupcake joints, but I find Gigi's cupcakes to be more satisfying in most cases. They do also have a rewards program. \n\nI was impressed when I went in for the first time to obtain the Sexual Assault Awareness Month cupcake that it was clearly labeled and employees had knowledge of the program. There's been too many times I'll go to a business for this type of fundraiser and employees are clueless - Gigi's employees were well informed and helpful even after I forgot to use my rewards club and she had to go back into their system. She did so without hesitation and never lost her smile.\n\nI will admit I have a preference for companies, local or chain, that I know support causes important to me.

That in itself is worth the cost and I have no idea how much money I have saved over the last probably about 5 years as well as multiple gift certificates earned.\n\nI also love it when they have some of their great sales!

I'd normally round up, but there were enough service gaffes that I'm not quite comfortable rounding up here. I found the food to range from average to excellent. \n\nThe excellent: tenderloin stuffed with crab meat was amazing. Tenderloin (my order! I love when I get the best dish!) was a perfect medium rare (as ordered), and there was a generous portion of crab meat inside. The sauce on it was also delicious. The veal oscar was also really good, and had an extremely generous portion of lobster.\n\nThe good: Freshly baked warm bread. The strip steak was amazing. My house salad which came with fresh mozzarella, roasted eggplant and roasted red pepper was a unique salad option. It wasn't anything I couldn't make myself, but it was well-executed, and I appreciated having the option of getting something other than a basic salad. Everyone else in my group got the dinner salad with creamy italian dressing, tossed tableside. Most of my family really loved it, but husband and I thought they went a bit heavy on the dressing. Next time, I'll ask for the dressing on the side.\n\nThe average: Ribeye was perfectly fine, but nothing special. I've cooked just as good of a ribeye. Rack of lamb was tasty, but just a little tough.\n\nThe service: Friendly, though slow at first, especially since we were close to the only people there when we first arrived (early reservations, filled up a bit later on). Server was good about dealing with my family's picky requests and side substitution requests. Brother's medium rare steak came out well-done though, and it took a really long time for him to get another one. Luckily he's a fast eater, because most of us were finished by the time his new steak came out. Also, the credit card machine was down, which meant we had to write down the credit card number for them to run the following week. I understand that sometimes that sort of thing can't be helped, but that doesn't mean I'm comfortable having my credit card number sitting around a random restaurant all weekend.

So if anyone at Gerard's reads this, next time someone asks for a handicap accessible table, the one on a platform really isn't ideal.\n\nOverall though, I thought the food was good, and I'll keep this place in mind when I'm in St. Louis in the future.", "date": "2010-11-28 15:25:38"}, {"_key": "1003210", "_id": "reviews/1003210", "_rev": "_fNyryLy--G", "review_id": "cvOnNivcjtM7d4MmY7eWqQ", "user_id": "gfQqQYI5_hCAGEHlHXIz2Q", "business_id": "EI2_OgANt1Mb_83cNnpPwg", "stars": 3, "useful": 3, "funny": 1, "cool": 3, "text": "We went because one of our group raved about the pizza.

I always try to drink local beers, wherever I am so I really loved the beer selection since it hosted multiple options. I had an excellent IPA. We were all having such a great time at the bar that waiting for the table didn't feel like waiting at all.\nThe service was really great from start to finish too. Everyone worked hard and as a team. The same young lady who served us at the bar, was running food. The same gentleman that took our order was helping at the bar...I saw everyone doing everything - whatever and where ever they were needed. I don't think I have ever seen such a well-managed team of restaurant staff. It was really impressive.\nI loved the menu, everything sounded so good, all kind of slider variations. Everything was delicious. Believe it or not, the big winner for many people was the Black Bean Slider! The Sweet Potato Waffle Fries were bomb too and I also tried Fried Green Tomatoes which were tasty too. There wasn't one complaint from our very large group - which I think says a lot. For the quality of food & level of service, I thought the menu was very well priced. Worth every penny. The servers were kind enough to give us all separate checks which was so helpful to us.

I freaking fracking love bocconcini.\n\nMichael seemed to really enjoy his spaghetti and lobster, although it seemed a wee bit difficult to eat.\n\nNeither of us were willing to share dessert, so we both ordered cheesecake.

Yes there are long lines to eat, drink, use the port-o-lets, and throngs of crowds packed up against the stages.

They have other stages set up all over the Quarter and you can have a great time all over the entire area.

If you MUST have a baby and its stroller at the fest then just stay away from the river front as it isn't safe for the baby or others that might get smashed into your stroller by the crowd.\n\nTip 2:  Leave your chairs at home as there isn't enough space to set up long lines of chairs and it is a real safety hazard and I will still barrel through your comfy encampment in a heartbeat on my way back and forth to get beer or go to the bathroom so don't think you're safe from my big ugly feet stomping through your \"section\" just because you're in a chair.

I absolutely loved it. My husband, mother-in-law, and I were visiting L.A. (1st time visit for me) from TN for us and from IL for her. We all knew we wanted to experience everything that beautiful wine country had to offer (without going to Napa Valley). My husband came across this tour, checked it out, and decided to book about a week before we embarked on our vacation. I don't believe he had any trouble booking online. None of us wanted to drive to wine country from L.A. for obvious reasons, so in addition to booking the tour online, my husband booked Amtrak train tickets to ride from L.A. to Santa Barbara and back. I could imagine that most people do not want to drive, so I believe riding the Amtrack train was recommended. Anyway, the day of our tour our Amtrack train happened to be running late (go figure), which in turn, made us late to our final destination in Santa Barbara. We were on pins and needles because we did not want our tour guide, Dave, to leave us or think that we were no shows. However, he called about 5 minutes after we were supposed to arrive, and we informed him we were running behind due to the train. We arrived about 20 minutes late (cringe), but Dave was there waiting nonetheless and greeted us with a smile and pleasant demeanor. He helped my mother-in-law into the Hummer, offered us hair ties, and we were off to begin our journey! We caught views of downtown Santa Barbara, which was extremely beautiful and such a breath of fresh air in comparison to L.A.!\n\nThe drive from Santa Barbara to Santa Ynez was about half an hour and super fun in the open air Hummer with the sun to warm us up and the wind in our hair! As you travel to wine country, you feel a noticeable difference in temperature. I had a jacket on when we left and by the time we arrived, I had tossed it. However, on the way back that evening, I quickly reunited with it :-). So, I would advise bringing a jacket that can easily be tucked away or pulled out and a great camera. Don't forget a bag with a good closure on it to put it all in (with a strap you can easily hold on to). You don't want your belongings loose and sliding around in the Hummer or there is a good chance they may very well fall out! On the drive to Santa Ynez, you will not want to miss snapping shots of the breathtaking views, especially if you are a photography enthusiasts like myself. For each of the 3 wineries we visited (Brander, Kalyra, and Bridlewood), they knew Dave by name and greeted us all with a smile. Each sommelier was attentive, super pleasant, and extremely knowledgeable on their winery's wines. Each winery was about 10 minutes apart or so. Dave took our lunch orders for gourmet sandwiches that we ate at our 2nd winery stop at Kalyra (where the movie Sideways was filmed). The sandwiches were super delicious and paired well with wine! However, by that time, I needed plenty of water, which Dave had on the Hummer for us. At Kalyra we were shown the actual scene areas where Sideways was filmed, and they had memorabilia that you can look at. Dave was attentive to my mother-in-law, who needed extra time and assistance with getting in and out of the Hummer. He even gave us each souvenir wine glasses to remember our tour. However, I was so sad to see that our glasses did not survive our trip back to TN and broke to pieces inside our suitcase (bummer!!!). Luckily, the red wine we purchased from Brander, did survive the trip. It just would have been nice to drink it out of our souvenir Backroads wine glasses. \n\nIf we ever visit L.A. or the surrounding areas again, we will most certainly put this tour on our to-do list. My husband and I loved it so much that we said we may just stay in Santa Barbara for our next trip out west.

I absolutely love the charm and atmosphere of the restaurant! I even love that they have seating in the back of an old pick up truck just outside. However, the disappointment came from the food and service. Our waiter seemed to be bored/uninterested and really didn't go out of the way to be friendly or assist us with the menu since it was our first time dining there. \n\nOn to the food...we tried the infamous alligator and shrimp cheesecake and neither of us were sold. It had a very tangy sauce that was very off putting  to us. The complimentary cornbread muffins were dry but tasty. The fried crabmeat stuffed shrimp were excellent and I definitely recommend them. We also had the spinach salad which was very sad. It was super small with just a few pieces of spinach dressed with a vinaigrette and a little fried oyster. Next, we had the fried boudin balls which were just ok. Lastly, we had the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e which flat out just didn't have much flavor. Overall, it's a charming city landmark but I wasn't impressed by the food or service.", "date": "2017-02-23 20:06:47"}, {"_key": "1004686", "_id": "reviews/1004686", "_rev": "_fNyryPK--X", "review_id": "CkYljg_SO9qwdq_0vj1lCw", "user_id": "IcowqfUjDSmdwtT0vp4pRg", "business_id": "oo54fNfXC7IkxwpeoPE15w", "stars": 4, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I was craving for chipotle, stopped by.

For those of you not in the Big Easy, PJ's is simply a coffee shop that originated in New Orleans, uses coffee roasted right here in New Orleans, has a NOLA theme in most stores and has 65 or so franchises.\n\nIt's rare of me to go to a coffee shop to sit down, relax and have a cup.  I'm usually driving somewhere near the port for work and dash in, grab an iced coffee to go and am out the door in less than 5 minutes.  However, I found myself at Pep Boys last week getting new tires on the wife's SUV and had a lot of time to kill.\n\nI Yelped the nearest coffee shop and PJ's was approximately 3/4 of a mile away on the corner of David Dr & W. Napoleon.  So I decided to take a walk and check it out.  The store was very clean and there was NOLA decor everywhere.  It wasn't big by any means, but there were 7 tables, a couch, a love seat and 2 plush chairs in which to perch your butt.  There was also a huge display featuring PJ's coffees, t-shirts and NOLA based \"stuff\" for sale.\n\nAlthough I did not partake of any pastries, they did have a nice selection.  I got myself an iced coffee with whole milk and sat down for a bit and enjoyed the relaxing music.  It wasn't quite elevator music, but it wasn't quite pop either.  Not too soft and not too loud.  I guess it was coffee shop music for lack of a better definition.\n\nThe iced coffee was good and a large size set me back just under $4.00.  I still don't know how to sit and relax so I pounded the coffee down in less than 5 minutes and went up to get a refill.  I wasn't sure how much it would be (a few places are free) but the refill set me back just under $3.00.  \n\nNo complaints here, as the coffee was good, the staff was nice and the place was exceptionally clean.

The building's outside didn't speak for the inside: live jazz music, modern lightning, plush seating and an overall big city dining experience.  I truly couldn't believe Steam was a St. Pete beach establishment.  \n   The menu was packed full with fun brunch creations like Shrimp and grits, Blue Crab Benedict and one serious plethora of savory and sweet crepes.  I ordered the shrimp and grits.  Besides the fact my fried egg was overcooked to over-medium, it was excellent.  Yes, I would have loved running yolk further flavoring the cheesy, hot-sauced grits, but I got over it pretty fast.  The shrimp were huge and flawlessly cooked.  The grits were up to par for this Southern belle with a creamy consistency full of flavor from the spicy sauce and melted cheeses. This dish scored a B+ in my cookbook.\n    My beau ordered a Florentine Crepe.  Wow.  I will be ordering this next time I am there.  Stuffed with fluffy scrambled eggs, tomatoes, ham and loads of spinach, this enormous crepe was also topped with a creamy lemon butter sauce.  Rich without causing a tummy ache, it was real a winner.\n   My brother ordered the Blue Crab Benedict. Normally, I feel that restaurants kill the classic and simple Benedict.  Too often the poached eggs are overdone and the English muffins are toasted for five seconds.  This was not the case at Steam.  The poached egg spewed bright yellow yolk into the crispy crevasses of the muffin.  The blue crab was seemingly fresh but definitely not the best quality crab I've ever had.  A little on the pricey side too-at $15 a pop.  \n    My brother's girlfriend enjoyed a crepe filled with spinach, artichokes, goat cheese and tomatoes.

In this case, I didn't have much hope.  I mean, its tucked away in a corner off of 4th street, not  visible from the street except for the sign, and behind a bank.  None of that has anything to do with whether or not its good fusion, but I had a bad feeling based on the location and the set up.  Also, Asian Fusion sounds made up.  All Asian cuisines seem to blend together anyway.  If you own an Asian recipe book at home, a lot of the ingredients sound the same.  So fusing them together doesn't exactly sound very complicated or artful. \n\nPerhaps it was because of my low expectations, but I really enjoyed it here.  Everything about our meal was excellent.  I don't know if it was the best Asian food in the area, but if not, it really came close.  Service was great, food was excellent.\n\nWe started with a drink and appetizer - I ordered the Souzoumariim which is a martini made with vodka, st. germain liqueur, mint, and sparkling sake.  I wanted something I didn't think I would ever order anywhere else, and it was delicious.  Refreshing, tasty, and the mint didn't overpower (in fact, none of the ingredients overpowered another).  We also split an everglades roll, which is tuna, salmon, yellowtail, jalape\u00f1o, cilantro, avocado and ponzu sauce wrapped in seaweed.  The roll was superb - not overloaded with rice, but stuffed with the listed ingredients.  It was almost disappointing that I didn't get more sushi as an entree instead of going with the entree I chose, which was the Tan Tan Men - ramen with garlic, ginger broth, scallions and ground pork.  Firstly, when in the world did poor college student food become restaurant quality? Ramen?  Really?  I was shocked to see ramen restaurants start popping up everywhere, but I have to admit, it was really good.  Not overly spicy, but hot with a ton of flavor.  I could have used a loaf of bread to soak up all the broth, but alas, I just drank it instead.\n\nThe restaurant is classy and intimate.  It could have been more romantic, but they sat us next to a party of 12.  I would normally take some marks off of the service for that - really horrible seating decision when you had plenty of other open tables and we were a couple looking for a nice dinner.  However, we enjoyed the dinner so much that it doesn't lose the 5th star for that.   I'm actually not positive it deserves 5 stars, but I can't think of a single reason to take away a star.  It's a bit pricey, but its high quality and a class restaurant, so I can't say they priced their menu wrong and certainly not bad enough to lose a star.

Both served with the same weak-ass croutons.\n\nWe did the maryland crab cakes since everyone on yelp seems to love them.

In most cases, it deserves all of the hype. In case you're unfamiliar, Good Dog stuffs their delicious burger with cheese. And there are few feelings more satisfying than biting into a burger and having blue cheese ooze out of the middle. To make the experience even better, Good Dog serves a generous portion of delicious sweet potato fries. My only complaint is that my burger was slightly undercooked, but not enough for me to want to send it back. And while a bun might not be important to some people, I love that the burger is served on a fluffy, buttery roll. The burger and fries was more than enough to fill me up for lunch.\n\nGood Dog understands how to maintain a good beer list. During my lunch I had Furthermore brewery's Makeweight, a Belgain IPA.

In the end the pizza we received wasn't multigrain, we ended up with a salad about the size of the receipt for $9(seriously, I'll be posting a picture), and the only thing they got right was the 2 liter of diet coke. \n\nI called about the salad and the guy on the phone said it wasn't correct but if they refund the full order and then charge it again he \"didn't know\" what would happen(what?). In the end I settled for a $3 credit on my next order which I'll probably never use, since I can't imagine I'll order from there again.\n\nAs for the pizza itself, there's almost no sauce on it and the sauce tastes very different. It's also way, way greasier than it was before. Overall, I can't recommend this place anymore. Will be on the hunt for a great local pizza place.", "date": "2014-12-18 23:13:39"}, {"_key": "1006062", "_id": "reviews/1006062", "_rev": "_fNyryVu--T", "review_id": "toB8Xx1PxN6Snxshz5oV2A", "user_id": "xRX1mRo8qeS2Gov7D773Dg", "business_id": "MqFQqNhMRaizyVRwsea6EA", "stars": 3, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "Dropping a client off at Bratz is how I found out about them.

I'm not a beer drinker but, I posted some photos. I did try the Kuemmerling shot though. If you like jager give it a go. It has some similar notes. There is a bite that hits you at the end and can linger. A couple sips of water or other and you're good. lol\nI ordered the Nuernberger. I was so excited. I knew what I wanted before I got there. It was a disappointment though. It wasn't hot, room temperature and I don't know just nothing to brag about.\nMy biggest gripe was the cashier. Don't get me wrong she was nice but, a little more training may be in order. A customer asked how to pronounce something on the menu. She proceeded to say \"I don't know. Blah blahzay\" and some weird gurgulling noise. Offensive much???? If you're German inspired respect the culture. Train your people properly.  How to read the menu should be basics 101.

I doubt there is a chinese chef in fact BUT among the surge of indo-chinese fusion restaurants this is a good one. \n\nHot & Sour Soup: Pretty good, had a good amount of vegetables in it\n\nChicken lettuce wraps: It's not as good as the tofu version I've had at PF Chang's or the ones I've made at home (just to toot my own horn ;-)) BUT it is worth the order and fun to eat with the kids.

NO \"lamb-y\" aftertaste, cooked/marinated well and a nice accompanying sauce\n\nGeneral Tso's chicken: tasty but the chicken was cute into small little bites and so were ALL the other dishes so I'd say they could definitely stick to tradition here and just do the chunky chicken pieces and make it different from the other dishes we ordered\n\nThai red curry: MY favorite dish here. PACKED with flavor and super tasty. Many others on the table loved it but it is VERY spicy so beware or ask for it to be milder. \n \nHakka noodles: At first glance, it looked very plain and boring so I saved it for last. BUT, it was really good. It had the perfect amount of flavor without being overbearing. \n\nThai basil fried rice: My second favorite. Definitely a must order item\n\nDate Pancakes: ANOTHER must order- SO delicious. Ask for it with lychee ice cream. \n\nChocolate Rolls: Was just spring roll with chocolate in it-- I'd skip that unless the kids want something. \n\nThere were a few other dishes that had comparable taste to the other chicken dishes so I'd say to add variety, venture into vegetarian options and do some lamb as well. \n\nALSO, major plus point is that it is *halal meat* for those who observe! \n\nGlad this place opened-- I will be here for lunch/dinner/linner. \n\nUnfortunately, the ONLY thing that has my review at 4 and not 5 as that we waited an entire hour for food.

Although there was room in the inviting patio area, I wanted to inside to see what the restaurant looked like.  I was seated promptly and had attentive service.  I choose to go with the Bayview Crab Cakes - Pan-fried blue crab cakes served on a bed of greens, with red chile mayo and basil aioli.  The crab cakes weren't huge, but seemed appropriate for lunch time.  I like the flavor combo with the condiments.\n  I also had a delicious House Salad - Mixed greens, dried cranberries, sliced toasted almonds, crumbled gorganzola, and house vinaigrette.  Nice and light, with lots of flavor.  Overall, very satisfying with good flavor.\n\n  I liked the restaurant so much that when my wife asked me where she could meet a friend on the northside of Indy, I suggested she head to Zionsville to Patrick's.  I was glad I was invited too!\n  \n  We met on a rainy Tuesday (6-14-16) and after a short stroll from a side street where we parked, we met our friend inside.  I started off with a local craft brew and then ordered half and half lunch option:  side salad and half a sandwich.  My wife and friend ordered one of the specials for the day:  The chicken Quesadilla which both thought was a good choice.\n\n  Because I liked the salad on my first visit, I chose it again this time.  I then chose the Spinach Melt - Spinach blend with cheddar cheese, tomato, and bacon grilled on multi-grain bread.  This had a nice flavor and because the spinach was cooked, it didn't seem too much along with the spinach salad. I would order it again.\n\n  The food came out fast again, the only negative in both visits is that the salads and entrees came out at the same time.  So, next time, I will ask if the salad can be brought out ahead of time.  I chose to eat the entree while hot...it just seemed a little weird to the salad last.\n\n  Anyway, my wife wanted to try the Chocolate Volcano dessert which we split three ways.  It was a personal chocolate cake with a \"molten\" center with a couple scoops of vanilla ice cream.  The flavor of the cake was good and the center was moist, but there wasn't anything \"molten\".  We didn't get too disappointed, but it didn't fit the description.\n\n  Much like the revival of Main Street in Speedway, Zionsville can be proud of the number of quality restaurants and shoppes opening up there.  (I still love the brick streets!)

Each dish came out as soon as it was ready, which I much prefer when you're sharing; it also ensures that your raw fish isn't sitting on the counter, waiting for the bento to be made. No parasites or infectious bacteria for us, thank you!\n\nThe Tuna Sushi was perfect - temperature, texture, and rice...all exactly as they should be. I try the tuna at every sushi bar I visit and I've had some terrible imitations, where the tuna is as thin as cold cut ham, or extremely chewy (it should never be chewy!), or where the rice falls apart the second you touch it. Mikado's tuna is literally perfect; these sushi chefs really know what they're doing and are able to store the raw fish at the perfect temperature.\n\nLikewise, the Dragon Eyes were - as always - delicious, with a heavy, savoury mayonnaise sauce that complements the taste of the rice and salmon. Be careful not to dip your dragon eye too much, or you'll end up just eating mayonnaise!\nThe California Rolls were as good as a California Roll can get (I wasn't being particularly adventurous during this visit), while the Deluxe Bento was a grilled/robata feast perfect for two people. Highlights of this bento were the BBQ salmon and beef shogoyaki - grilled to perfection!\n\nOne of the things I love about Mikado is that many of their staff are Japanese - it really adds to the authenticity of the place and their servers are always so friendly and sweet, making for a much more pleasant dining experience.\n\nThe only negative aspect to our visit was that the bill for two people (with one alcoholic and one non-alcoholic beverage) amounted to the $70-80 range.

They have an AMAZING  kitchen with plenty of seats. You get house wine and beer with your class, the also have a soda stream and both sparking and regular water. Today we made cheese...ricotta and mozzarella. I found the instructor to be extremely friendly and knowledgeable. When asking questions I never felt like the were stupid  ones. This class was hands on, it was fun getting my hands dirty so to speak. At the end of the class we were made a pasta dish (olive oil, red pepper flakes, garlic, tomatoes, and basil-so simple yet so delicious) for lunch and got to eat our cheese with it. Any extra cheese we had we could take it home. I found the class to be extremely informative and made me feel comfortable with trying this at home. After class you got 10% off everything in the store except the Green Egg and 5% off your next class if you book within 7 days. One negative was the down time. There seemed to be a lot of just waiting, I think this was because the weren't enough burners or space for everyone to be in the kitchen at once.

I came in with a friend during prime dinner hours only to find one other couple dining. A feeling of concern came over me... which was later justified. I didn't feel like trying the Korean BBQ and decided on other menu items. I'm kind of wishing I tried the BBQ because I was extremely unimpressed with what we ordered.\n\nMy friend and I decided on the Dinner for 2 which comes with Bulgogi, Galbi, Grilled Pike, Bean Paste Soup, Steamed Egg, and assorted banchan (side dishes). Along with that I ordered the Kimchi Stew. The galbi was tender, very flavorful, and probably the best of everything that hit the table. The steamed egg was a close second. The bulgogi, on the other hand, didn't seem like it was marinated enough because it was lacking a lot of flavor. The grilled pike wasn't bad, but it was a bit labor intensive to eat. The bean paste soup had great flavor and I favored that soup over the Kimchi Stew which had a odd tasting tangy-ness that wasn't pleasant. I typically love banchan at most Korean restaurants and this place definitely had the biggest selection of banchan I've ever seen in Tampa, but sadly there were only a couple that tasted good. The battered and pan-fried zucchini was, by far, the best one. Most of the banchan items tasted and looked old... which was very disappointing.\n\nThe service was okay, but very slow. My biggest complaint comes from the fact that banchan is typically unlimited. If you want some more of a particular item, it usually isn't a problem to get a refill. This is the case with all the items EXCEPT the pan-fried zucchini. I asked for a refill and the lady proceeded to explain the cooking process and told me that it's the only one I can't have because it takes too long to make, despite the fact that I was willing to wait for it. And that answers the question as to why it's the best tasting-- because it's made to order.\n\nDefinitely NOT the best Korean restaurant in the Tampa area, in my personal opinion.

The rolls are small here thus I order more it does get expensive at times because you keep ordering to get full. The Udons are great as well. I love it here but I can't seem to leave without dropping $150-$200 every time I go here with my wife and young children (12,11,8 &7).

Easily one of the best dining experiences I had. The boyfriend took me here on my last visit here and I was so happy we did! The restaurant was simple: nothing too extravagant inside, and the menu short (not to be confused with not enough good food - every dish was memorable).  \n\nWe ordered the following:\n1. Mushroom dan dan noodles - delicious! I love mushrooms and the gravy of the noodles was perfect. Not too oily, and paired with well cooked dan dan noodles and big mushrooms with the gravy. \n2. Peruvian fries - my boyfriend and I were secretly fighting over these...that good. We kept offering the plate to each other, hoping the other wouldn't eat the last few bites until finally he just ate the last bite #keeper. These fries were some of the best I've had - think thick steak cut fries, with cilantro, onions, and a yellow sauce of some sort. The flavors were unique and like I've never had before!\n3. Tempeh sandwich - our favorite part, besides the tempeh which I usually don't love (this was cooked extremely well though), were the pickled pickles. The pickles had a jalapeno sort of juice on them, making them zestier and spicier. Extremely delicious with our sandwich! \n4. House coffee soft serve ice cream - simple but smooth, strong and a perfect end to our meal. \n\nFor drinks, I tried the lemonade of the day, sparkling cherry. A little too sweet for me, and on the higher side, priced at $5 for a small glass, but still very good. My bf had the mustard gin cocktail...sounded weird and also tasted a bit weird. But it worked! Again, so unique . \n\nWe were floored by the service, simple ambiance, and \"street\" style food.\nI recommend ordering 2-3 dishes for 2. We ordered 3 and had trouble finishing everything with our drinks (but of course we wiped our plates clean).

My largest complaint with this location is FRESHNESS. Yes, as others have said I have bought cupcakes from here and they were frozen. Obviously it's their attempt to save what didn't sell but unfortunately they do not really thaw out all that gracefully...not terrible...just not fresh. I've also encountered down right stale cupcakes. The problem with a dense mixture is that when it goes stale... it really goes dry. If you were unfortunate enough to have bought some like these I promise you 30-45 seconds in the microwave (and eaten quickly) saves the day. Once again, not terrible...just not fresh. And very rarely I'm downtown and stop in this location and get exactly what I want (they carry various flavors various days) and it's up to par. Also as a setback, this location does not carry as many flavors/number of options as the northern libs location. I often wondered if that location sends their old cupcakes here. Hmm.

It seems this business may have finally gotten some folks in who are willing to listen to their paying customers. MUCH has changed.\n\nThe management seems concerned about bringing their customers an extremely better experience, from the waitstaff, to the options, offers, recommendations, and the food itself. My wife and I love to support our local businesses where we can, and now that Mirko has shown willingness to listen and improve, we'll be much happier to return.\n\nWe went in on a Wednesday (to which we then found out they have a current promotion of 50% off select bottles of wine!), and were immediately greeted by a hostess and manager. We were seated quickly and offered several menus and informed of the new local options hand created by the new chefs... Yes, they not only have new waitresses and new management staff, but they also have new kitchen staff - and these guys seem to care about their creations!\n\nWe ordered the Italian Nachos as an appetizer, and it was extremely flavorful and quite tasty. A massive difference from anything we tried from our last (and only) previous visit. My wife ordered the chicken parm, and I took the recommendation from the manager and chef and tried their Mt Juliet only offered special dish of the NY Strip Steak and roasted potatoes. EVERYTHING was delicious! The steak was cut thin and very tender and flavorful with a superb sauce/glaze on it, and the wife's chicken parm was tender, flavorful and very fresh. We inquired about the meat selections later in the evening and learned that Mirko sources their meats locally from Houston's right down the road! Very good meal and excellent, but not overwhelming, portion sizes.\n\nWe also tried the cannoli and cheesecake for dessert (also sourced locally from Tennessee Cheesecake!), and these were excellent as well... all in all, they are trying very hard to earn back their customers and build their business. If you have any concerns or had a previous negative experience, just let management know when you walk in. They will do everything in their power to make sure your new experience is tremendous and you feel welcomed and encouraged to return.\n\nThis may be our new go-to in lieu of Olive Garden/Maggianos for Italian locally! We will now return!\n\nP.S. In the only negative I can think of, we did make note to mention to the manager the only constructive criticism we can find while there for the \"new experience\"... it was yet again the bread offering. This was the only thing we didn't like. These are honestly straight out of the bag, Kroger-style frozen dinner rolls. However, you are now offered an option for either standard oil or bean dip, which was quite nice, as last time we received a less-than flavorful bland mixture of goop without choice.

While waiting for my order the other day, I witnessed several employees leaning against the front counter, with their backs turned to the dinning room, eating a bowl full of food in between serving customers.  Call me crazy, but there is something about this that just seems wrong to me.\n\nSince they gave us no order number, when our food was ready they packaged it up and just kind of left it until they noticed us starring at them in wonderment, and gestured in such a manner to indicate that this was our order (in between conversations and eating, of course - God forbid they walk the 6 steps over to where we are sitting to let us know our order was ready).  When we approached the counter, every single employee turned their backs to us and did not say one word (no 'thank you', no 'have a good night', no eye contact whatsoever).  If the staff care this much about the customers, I can only imagine how much care and attention they put into preparing the food (....or not!).\n\nI am on the fence here - do I give 2 or 3 stars??

Or spend less and just get the sandwich without paying for a side I don't need. \n\nSo I popped in last night really for dessert, but the BBQ pulled pork mac & cheese was calling my name. I think the dish is an inspired concept, but it lacked execution. The big problem is that I expect mac & cheese to have a strong CHEESE flavor, and this was more like macaroni in a light cream sauce.

If you're been to Maggiano's you know that portions are massive! \n\nMy family and I visit Maggiano's once every couple months or so because of the catering to those who eat gluten free.  There aren't many restaurants that have gluten free rolls available so typically my husband just watches the rest of us eat bread.  Not at Maggiano's!  Gluten free diners get a visit from a chef or manager to ensure their meal is ordered and prepared correctly.  The gluten free pasta they use is very good.  I cannot tell a major difference between the gf and regular.\n\nI do love Rigatoni D but I ventured away from it this time.  I also like the gnocchi and there was a Veal Meatball Bolognese special on the menu with gnocchi.  I really enjoyed this pasta dish.  Typically the gnocchi is good but it's one note as the entire thing has the same sauce. (I believe the gnocchi I used to get was actually taken off the menu and replaced with a gnocchi and italian sausage dish.)  The gnocchi I tried on this visit had a rich bolognese sauce and three large veal meatballs.  It was definitely delicious.  My dad loves the lasanga there and since it's a classic pasta, he gets to take home a second pasta dish.  He, of course, chooses more lasagna.  That's like 4 meals worth of lasagna right there for $12.95.  \n\nThere are certainly some more expensive items on the menu but since I love the pasta so much, I never venture into the entrees that are more than $15.

She surprisingly provided us with samples of 3 of their beverages in cute tiny glasses. I was familiar with them having sampled similar offerings at other establishments, but to my gf it was all new. She selected the horchata and I agreed it was very good, I opted for Jamaica and we both enjoyed our choices. The one not selected was great as well, a fresh pineapple juice.\n\nNext up were the house made chips and trio of salsas. These are my type of chips, thick, fresh and not over salted. The sauces are great too, green, spicy sour cream and a red chipotle that had a nice kick. Guac was ordered to enhance the experience, and it was perfect, chunky, vibrant and topped with just the right amount of onions and tomatoes.\n\nMy gf sampled the shrimp burrito and loved it. It was perfectly built and seasoned, large enough for many to take half home and garnished with lettuce, cukes and sour cream. My choice of tacos dorados was possibly even better. 5 rolled up chicken tacos were fried then topped with a crema, queso blanco and shredded lettuce. The meat was mildly seasoned and tender and moist.

Unfortunately, free parking is hard to find.  The restaurant itself has a nice patio as well as an inner dining area.  I like that the upstairs area is a little more separate from the street, and there is a good partial view of the kitchen staff as they prepare food.  I like the ambience of the place although it was a bit dark.  There was also live music as we settled down to eat which added to the atmosphere.\n\nFood: 4.5/5  The food was delicious!  I had the 'white sturgeon' ... although sturgeon was not available so it was substituted with tuna.  Nevertheless, the dish was very good.  Tuna was cooked where it was sufficiently crispy on the outside but partially raw on the inside, kind of like tataki but a thicker slice.  The broth was a good mix of sweet and spicy with the appropriate amount of tomatoes.  Huge prawns, veggies, and potatoes added to the taste.  Overall satisfactory portion size and very tasty.\n\nService: 4/5  Overall efficient and friendly\n\nPrice: 3/5  on the higher side but expected for type of food and dining experience\n\nOverall: 4.5/5  Overall we both really enjoyed our dinner at Sabor!

Soupremacy has a friendly staff, a celebrity filled wall of cool pictures and decor and a nice selection of soup to choose from. I have no complaints except that I want some right now and I wish they would always offer you cold soup if theirs isn't ready for serving.

Would not have mattered if it rained or not -- I was drenched with sweat the first five minutes after stepping out of the car. The place is massive and has seating levels from VIP box seats to bring your own lawn chairs. Every so often you got a hint of breeze passing over you -- it was such a relief after sitting in the suffocating heat with 18,000 people sitting around you. The sound in this amphitheater is pretty sweet -- was not too loud other than when the pyrotechnics went off -- pretty sure I lost some hearing from the thunderous roar of the rockets exploding on stage. Sadly, all the vendors selling their products charge three times more than what they are worth. They know you will buy a $7.00 bottle of iced cold water because it is 100 degrees!! Patience is a virtue --- getting out of this place after the concert was horrific to say the least. It took us an hour to inch towards Orient Road. \nAll in all one thing is for sure -- in the future no matter how much I love the band -- I will never attend a concert at this venue in July.

Every time my heels hit those glossy green slate tiles, it's like I'm a kid again, walking with my mom down the corridors of The Special Mall.  Lakeside was where we went when my mom needed stuff she couldn't get from the Plaza.  It wasn't the Really Fancy Mall, though--that was The Esplanade out in Kenner,  We only went there like once a year.  But The Esplanade sucks, so I haven't been there in years.  Lakeside, though, is still awesome.  We'll make the trip out there a couple times a year, except this time it's usually me and a friend, not me and my mom.  But I still feel nostalgic about the place.\n\nFrankly, I really like dead malls, so for a while there I was kind of rooting for Lakeside to fail so that I could walk through there and enjoy the creepy time-warp of it.  But that doesn't appear to be in the cards, because they keep adding on to the thing and it's in a pretty bustling part of Metry.  I guess I'll have to go out to The Esplanade to get my dead mall fix.\n\nI guess the food court could use work.  The other day I was there with a friend and I was hungry, and the only thing in there that I even thought about eating was the Greasy Chinese Food place, but they didn't have much in the way of variety, and I don't eat meat (except seafood).  I guess Subway is OK, but I eat that a lot at work.  And those were the only 2 places I would even consider.  How about some kind of gyro place?  Or maybe a PJ's coffee shop?  Even Clearview Mall has that.\n\nLakeside has a good variety of stores--the basics, from low-middle to high-middle end.

So I rounded up the gang and hit it up a few weeks ago.\n\nSabrina's has somewhat of an ardent fan following in Philadelphia.  They have a few other locations around the city, all of which are really recommended for the food.  And they are absolutely right!  The vegetable spring rolls, the barking chihuahua (a burrito, just to be clear), and the eggs benedict all come recommended from my own experiences here.  The veggie spring rolls (not something you'd expect in a place like this) are fresh, flavorful, and a great addition to their menu.  The barking chihuahua, a behemoth burrito (somewhat interesting name, if you think about it), is filled with eggs, beans, peppers, cheese, and just about anything else that you want in it.  Eggs benedict is also done well here, albeit the hollandaise is a bit too eggy per my liking (a common issue).\n\nOn the other hand, while the stuffed french toasts are loved by some, my friends (and I) all agreed that they seemed to be a bit too sweet for our liking.  If sweet stuff floats your boat, by all means go for it!\n\nStuff is reasonably priced, although a group of 3-4 can easily rack up a 60-70 dollar bill without much trouble.

This had a thick layer of foam, giving it a great texture, plus they put their logo (a meat cleaver) into the foam! The drink itself was light and tart, very well-balanced.\n\n* Meatery board ($25) - 4 stars\nAn excellent sampling of tons of meats & condiments. A little hard to share amongst 4 of us as there would be maybe a couple slices of a particular meat, but we still enjoyed it. There was a single boudin ball, but that worked with the side that came with three balls. All the meats were fresh, had great texture, and were full of unique flavors.\n\nA LA CARTE\n* Boudin Balls ($6) - 4 stars\nLove the even crisp breading, the gooey and lightly textured filling, and the thick dip!\n\nLARGE PLATES\n* BBQ Goat (citrus slaw, cornbread, pickled peppers. $23) - 3 stars\nThe meat was great, but the cornbread was really dry!\n\n* Double Cut Pork Chop (dirty rice, cane syrup gastrique. $32) - 3.5 stars\nWhat a huge cut of meat! This is a super impressive dish. For the sheer volume of pork, they did a good job keeping the flavor and moistness packed in throughout the entire cut. However, the meat was a bit tough and I wished it were a little more tender and easier to cut through. The rice was really tasty, but quite heavy!\n\n* Gulf Seafood Couvillion (Louisiana Gulf fish, shrimp, crab fat rice. $26) - 3 stars\nI wasn't overly impressed with the freshness of the seafood - the fish and shrimp were all a bit overcooked and tough.

However, prior to our arrival the people from hotels.com had contacted my friend and notified him that due to the heavy rain, the Best Western had been flooded and that we had been moved to the New Orleans Marriott. Sweet!!\n\nWe arrived here on a Friday night. The lobby was super packed and the line to check in was pretty long. We waited a little bit before it was our turn. We had requested for rooms with two double beds plus a roll away bed in each room to accommodate all six of us. However, they didn't have anymore availability for doubles rooms and as such we were upgraded to a larger corner room with a King bed and we were also provided with a $50 bar credit and a $120 breakfast buffet credit for six at the 5 Fifty 5 bar at the lobby. SUPER SWEET!!\n\nThe elevators in the hotel is pretty sweet, too. You don't have tons of buttons inside the elevator, but instead, when you're calling for an elevator you press the floor you want to go to and it will tell you which elevator you should wait at. For example, I was staying on the 37th floor, so when I'm calling for an elevator, I'd press 37 and the display will then show something like, \"E\" and and arrow pointing me where to go. This tells me that I should wait by the E elevator. Schweet, right? This way, there's no way some drunk asshole or some bratty kid get on the elevator with you will press all the buttons for the floors between the lobby and 37. \n\nWhen we got to our rooms, the beds were comfortable; the bathrooms were clean, and even the roll away beds were comfortable. There's plenty of extra pillows in the closet and plenty of towels. The only downside is the door seems to be pretty thin, as you walk down the hallway, you can definitely hear the noises from inside the room.\n\nThe amenities that the hotel provides is meh. Internet is $12.95 per day. Come on! I mean, I bitch about having to pay $40 internet PER MONTH! And I'm forced to pay a third that for a day. Ridiculous.\nParking is $38 per day. Yes, THIRTY EIGHT FREAKING DOLLARS! Is real estate really that expensive here? Or does Marriott just love milking their guests? I'm going to go with the latter.\n\nSo, if you drive here and need WiFi, that's already an additional $50/day on top of what you're paying for the room. And let's not forget the tax, alright? They add up quick. Boo for these and hence I'm taking away one star.\n\nOther than my disappointment in the high charge for internet and parking, my stay was otherwise enjoyable.  If you're considering to stay here, remember to factor in internet and parking to your budget.", "date": "2015-04-18 20:45:17"}, {"_key": "1009355", "_id": "reviews/1009355", "_rev": "_fNyryce--e", "review_id": "uBjsrJZc9ZAxxC8R77Mt0g", "user_id": "eJY8svAq_1pt1VQiHu7lew", "business_id": "9cybDNxJ7cyNVkmwm-ktcg", "stars": 4, "useful": 10, "funny": 5, "cool": 9, "text": "I've got mad, mad love for the Rouses chain in general.

But I probably won't go back here.  I realize I'm not an Indian food novice, but I just felt unwelcomed at this establishment.  I really wanted some chicken masala.  I was confused when I walked in because it's clearly an order and sit down place, but as soon as I walked in, a gentleman rushed up to the door wanting to know where I wanted to sit and what I wanted. There was a buffet, but the names of the foods weren't listed on it, so I was afraid to get anything, not knowing how hot it might be.  There was no menu to look at, so apparently no lunch deals.  I asked if there was chicken masala and thankfully they could make it.  So that's what I ordered with some garlic naan.  I then asked if they had any drinks. There was a Coca Cola fridge for beverages in plain site but it was void of beverages and clearly being used to store food in, which I'm worried might not be good in the health dept's eyes, but what do I know.  So I asked if they had any tea or anything.  I was told no that they had water.  I asked if I could have one, but was told there were no to-go cups.  I was so annoyed by this because I was on the run back to work and had no drinks in my office or with me.  I had to stop at a different place during lunch rush on the way to my office just to get a drink.  I felt the staff was unfriendly.  The chicken was like whole pieces of breast, not really very cut up.  Which was difficult to deal with, without a knife.  I paid almost $20 for my meal, which was way more than I wanted to pay.  But with no visible menu to know the cost and was told I would \"pay when food is finished\", so I couldn't really cancel the order.  The naan was good but the garlic was just raw giant hunks of chopped garlic on top, which is different from all other garlic naan I've had. I mean I love garlic - but raw garlic can really do a number on the old gut.   Maybe they are nicer to regulars and others probably like the place, it just wasn't for me.

On my first visit, it took foreeeevverrrr to get our food, but they'd just opened so we figured it was the result of growing pains, totally natural when you're just opening a business. However, I've found that Desperado's is highly consistent when it comes to two things: an under-occupied dining room, and extremely slow service.

I need to add my review to Yelp but even for old fashioned home cooking it was bland. I have decided that if a restaurant is at least half full of customers by 5pm and they are primarily over the age of say 75, turn and run. Lunch it's hard to judge by time but still can judge by age. I have found it to be true enough times that it is one of Melissa's Rules (like Gibbs' on NCIS). It was Friday and the special was catfish. We asked what was special about the Friday night catfish special vs the catfish on the menu - it had hushpuppies for the same price. REALLY, you added a couple of hushpuppies and that made it the Friday night special? Jeff had that and it was okay. I love fried pork chops so I chose that based on the recommendation of our rather young waiter. What makes a pork chop irresistible is that layer of fat around the edges and the sweetness of the meat clinging to the bone. My favorite places for pork chops know me and know that the uglier the chop, the better and select them especially like that for me. What was I served at Nana's? A couple of flavorless, overly thick slabs of pork loin sans fat, sans bone, with the breading heavy and not clinging to the meat. I ordered some greens and mashed potatoes and gravy as my sides if I remember correctly but I tried Jeff's sides and I know we had some sort of beans also. The greens were so bland that no amount of pepper vinegar and salt could season them. If things are not seasoned properly from the start, there is almost nothing you can do to save them and these were obviously one of those. The mashed potatoes were not even room temperature and the gravy was not hot enough to help warm them. As we were getting ready to leave, we heard others complaining about their steak special. I normally try to give a place a second try but each time we pass by my stomach begs me not to stop. Oh and while Nana herself might be there, I didn't find this place feeling particularly homey or welcoming and the service was at best average. There you go - my no holes barred review.

Who knew that less than a year after that, I'd be such a fan?\n\nI don't even live in Philly anymore, but I'm still a member.  I use it when I travel to Philly for work or to visit family.  \n\nCar sharing is great in general.  I won't even bother with the general awesomeness here.  But here are the things that make PhillyCarShare the best car share service in the nation:\n\n1.  The rates.  It is, by far, the cheapest car share service.  I've done comparisons.  Hourly rates are at least $3 cheaper per hour than my current service in another city.\n2. They are nonprofit.  PCS loves the environment, so they aren't in it for the money.  The fleet is mostly hybrids, which I really appreciate.\n3.  LOTS of cars.  I can stand at an intersection above the Green Line, where the trolley just passed us without stopping (and another isn't due for an hour), call them and say \"where can I get a car NOW.\"  They say \"walk two blocks and pick  up a Prius.  Awesome.  The fleet is huge, so I never had to take them up on their SEPTA reimbursement.\n4.  The public transit reimbursement.  If, say, you want one of the trucks for a big project, and the closest one requires a bus or subway ride to get there, they'll pay your fare.\n5.  Variety.  If you have a business meeting and don't want a big logo on your car, you can request a \"discreet\" car.  Want to go for a joy ride?  Get a convertible or other fancy type car.  Hauling stuff?  Go for the truck or the Element.\n\nSure, the site needs a bit of work (especially for those of us on a Mac). But if the site doesn't work I can always call and make a reservation 24/7.  And I do with some people would be more respectful and clean up the car. Some of the older ones are pretty worn.

If you're feeling ambitious and famished, the burger is incredible, as are the various sandwich offerings and ALWAYS the warm shrimp salad. \n\nFinally, dinner is an experience not to be missed! Beautiful entr\u00e9es comprised of classic french dishes, such as the moules frites or the half roast chicken, are wonderful ways to spend an evening. One of my close friends is a decisively critical eater when it comes to French food, mostly because he's so well versed thanks to the French side of his family. Nonetheless, even his discerning palate was truly impressed by Parc's offerings! \n\nDon't miss dessert here either! The menu offerings are excellent, like profiteroles, or the house-made macarons that are a secret off-the-menu option (not anymore!). Just ask your server for them, plus they are also available to go. \n\nThis beautiful restaurant always takes us back to our engagement in Paris and is a location full of happy memories from our excessive visits!

This is because ppl in Tucson just crave new and novelty things; or is it ppl all over for that matter?  But I digressed. \n\nI joined some friends at The parish a few weeks ago just for socialization and did not plan on eating much.  Upon getting there, I was quite intrigued with the menu items, two of which are frog legs and crawfish hushpuppies.  My friends ordered the bacon-wrapped frog legs and I ordered the hushpuppies, since I love crawfish.  The frog legs did not disappoint.  If you're health conscious, the bacon can be unwrapped and the legs enjoyed somewhat unaltered. No they don't taste like chicken and have a texture all their own.  Yes they are very tender and quite meaty (my memory does not recall frog legs that muscular).  I guess these guys were raised to have huge legs for our enjoyment (gotta love modern farming technique and growth hormone).  \n\nThen came the hushpuppies.  Probably the best fried food worth clogging your arteries for.  They were done to perfection [if you know me, I rarely used the word perfection]; crispy on the outside and moist with a hint of sweetness from the cornmeal on the inside.  But ... there is no flavor or bits of crawfish (as the menu suggested).  Normally, this is cause enough for me to discount the establishment as legit.  However, in this case, the hushpuppies were so good on their own merit that I decided to overlook this mis-representation (see perfection above).  Oh ... almost forgot, the onion marmalade that comes with the hush puppies as dipping sauce, let me just say that I do not have enough vocabulary to tell you how good it is and how well it goes with the hushpuppies. A perfect blend (there is that p-word again) of sweet and tangy, yet not overpowering, I can drink that stuff straight up ...\n\nOne small thing that impressed me about this place is that food comes out nice and hot - just like it was just coming off the frying pan or whatever cookware used to make it.  Small detail, but such is what makes or breaks a restaurant.\n\nSo there you have it - frog legs and hushpuppies worth a visit.  Not all items on the menu are New Orleans in nature.

It's laid-back but not divey, and feels like somewhere you'd go knowing that some of your friends and/or neighbors were bound to show up, too.  They've got an intimidatingly well-thought out selection of local beers and micro-brews on tap, each listed alongside its alcohol content for those of you who make decisions based on buzz potential. What's not intimidating are the prices--almost all beers were $4 or $5!  This...this I like.\n\nTo wash down my $4 beer, we picked out a couple of snacks from the menu--shrimp tacos and corn dogs (very hip in NY right now, too).  Holy moly, these shrimp tacos were some of the absolute best I've had EVER, and this isn't even a Mexican joint!  The corn tortillas were warm and fresh (possibly hand made?), the shrimp nice and juicy, and everything was drizzled with a spicy cilantro cream that had a genuine kick.  The $5 corn dog plate went above and beyond what any corn dog plate could even aspire to be--EIGHT plump fritters, with crispy, sweet cornbread on the outside and super-juicy dog bites on the inside.

Check me out - FTR (First To Review) and first to set a 5-star precedence, I'm sure.\n\nStupid me, I didn't bring an appetite, just a thirst for a pi\u00f1a colada because I knew here they have it in the machine so I wouldn't tempt the stink eye from a bartender (I was that bartender once, I admit). Here, you can order any kind of frozen concoction you want because they have a wall of frozen drink machines glorious churning up the colorful sweet stuff. You might feel like a kid at buffet where you can mix & match Pepsi and Mt. Dew and even Dr. Pepper (I was that child once). They have all these varieties and then will do something outrageous like a Pi\u00f1a Colada/Hypnotiq parfait. I stuck to the classic pi\u00f1a and wow, it even tasted like it wasn't filled with that obvious artificial flavor that some daiquiri places typically use (Gene's version is not drinkable, I'm sorry). It's true that I normally shun the sweet boozy stuff but there's something about a hot New Orleans day and the way these days practically beg for frozen cocktails. I'm a believer now. And this is where I'll be getting my fix. Sunday fundays, here's looking at you! \n\nDespite not bringing an appetite, I wanted to try their veg black beans (perfection-- just the right texture and seasoning) and oh, I can never say no to homemade tortilla chips. So, yes, I ate. It's kind of impossible not to at Pelican Bay. Know that if you're a vegetarian there are options for you (and how cool is it that they have a separate fryer for veggies?) and they note what isn't vegan on the menu, too. When asked by chef/owner Tanzanika what they could do to make the menu more veg-friendly, I suggested having some tofu options, maybe (I just love tofu. I know it's crazy). She laughed but seems like she's open to the idea. It's not even really necessary and if you're open to dairy, they have pizzas that look really great, too. Their emphasis is on FRESH food and yes, they shop daily. My guy had a burger that he said tastes just like \"Mom's burger,\" which for him is a big compliment (for me, not so much. My mom's burgers possibly turned me off meat forever. Please don't tell her I mentioned it, K?)\n\nService is fantastic from the moment you open the door and are warmly welcomed.

That is how I would describe Laurel. \n\nAfter months of waiting to secure a reservation, our group of six arrived on a chill Friday evening for the chef tasting. At $75 per person for a 7-course meal, I was excited and ready for a delicious meal. The setting was warm, inviting, and with comfortable high-back chairs, we knew we would be there awhile. And after that evening, I'd love for it to be my second home. \n\nI asked Laurel to send me the menu ahead of time since one of our guests had a seafood aversion. While I usually love surprises, I was happy to get a sneak peek! \n\nThere were so many highlights of that meal. From the first course of raw tuna delightfully covered in frozen horseradish with a zing of shaved green apple, to the flavorful duck confit that contained texture from the chicken skin and quail egg, everything on the menu was brilliant. The ricotta gnocchi was absolute joy, with the crispy pancetta that kept singing \"Amen!\" with every bite. That dish was powerful by itself. I thought that would be my favorite, but there was a truffle-crusted pork and braised belly with a pecan pesto accompaniment that really shined. And lastly, the dessert. Caramelized white chocolate pudding topped with more cocoa, puffed grains, and mulberries. Move over, Barbuzzo. Your salted caramel budino may be beat by this chocolate pudding from Laurel. It is now my favorite dessert, since it was light, not overly sweet, but enough to get an all-around-the-table wow! from everyone. (I may have heard some applause in the background, but that could have been the wine talking.)\n\nChef Elmi is talented, and presented us an impressive meal. Each dish was beautiful, and I was just a tad bit sad that I had to stick my spoon or fork in it. So much color, texture, and personality! The man himself stopped by our table, and we gave so much praise that was well deserved.\n\nThis restaurant is truly a gem.

The hot sauce style entree was good but I found the sauce consistency to be much too thin for my liking and the sauce to sort of hit one flat note-SPICY- likely because of its Sichuan chili oil base. Nonetheless, still great flavor and true to its name/description. The garlic sauce stir fry really stole the show. Extremely well-balanced in flavors. We loved how the sauce adhered to the chicken and veggies.

Could they pull it off on an ordinary day?\n\nI came in on a Monday night and was immediately greeted by the jolliest cashier ever, who was happy to welcome me back and provide recommendations on what I should eat.  Seeing that I had already tried (and loved) the smoked turkey, I chose that on Texas toast.  My intention was to see if the turkey, a protein that dries out easily, would again be just as smoky and succulent as last time.\n\nOh man...not only did I yet again bite into a smoky, succulent, peppery turkey breast that had been carved right in front of me, but also I was able to enjoy the buttery grilled Texas toast that was situated above and below it.  There was only one way to top such a prime sandwich: smother it in BBQ sauce.  My personal preference is to combine the mustard and the sweet BBQ sauces, which results in a drippy mess, but sometimes, you have to make sacrifices for a fine meal. (Suggestion: sit on the stools facing 10th Street so no one has to see your face and hands covered in BBQ sauce).\n\nAs if those thick slices of carved smoked turkey and Texas toast weren't enough, I still had two sides to try, the potato salad and the vinegar slaw.  What's so amazing about the potato salad (again) is that it has the consistency of a smashed potato dish but with the creamy, sweet additions of egg and mayo.  Plus, you have more sweetness and tang coming from the crunchy coleslaw, providing a balance in texture as you take a bite a mushy potato salad followed by a crunch of strings of carrot and cabbage.

Conversations where you are not so sure if he is arguing and making a point, or that he is just loud.  None the less, it was uncomfortable.  He was very nice to us and accommodating, just had a personality that I don't personally feel is suitable for a server.\n\nSo, on to the food.

They have the good old standards, which I don't hate per se, but being a native Austinite, they need a little twist, you know? One of my favorite breakfast restaurants is Hash House a Go Go (Vegas, Orlando, etc.). From my understanding, it was started by someone who grew up in Indiana who moved to San Francisco.

Otherwise, you will be so hungry, and so confused at the options! I was even looking at the menu beforehand...especially when thrown off by the different setup of the to go menu and regular menu. I also love that it is not .just a pancake house (although their pancakes are indeed exceptionally superb!)\n\nI had the San Francisco Benedict...sourdough toast smothered in my favorite hollandaise sauce and toppings one day, and that was pretty good. I especially loved you could sub out the potatoes with a lovely side of fresh fruit. It was way too much food for one person (although my husband and I almost always share restaurant meals...except breakfast is sometimes our exception).\n\nMy husband adored his blueberry pancakes and pumpkin pancakes. Okay, I thought they were fabulous as well!). He raved about the hand squeezed orange juice (although it was tiny and expensive).\n\nThe only thing I would say is their marketing seemed rather dated.

It was dinner rush peak hour and a Pacer's game had just let out downtown so it was PACKED.

I feel like Yelp should be used to help prop up local businesses that shine. On the other hand, it's also a tool to tell less than stellar businesses to step up their game. So, I have to stand with many of the other Yelpers who have left poor reviews. \n\nI was in town for a concert and wanted to get a bite to eat before the show. My options were limited. I could go to Hooter's, which would have felt really creepy since I was dining alone. Through the Yelp app, I found That's Amore nearby. \"Cool, Italian food. I can live with that.\" \n\nThe location is the best thing this place has going for it. It's right on Harbor Island which gives a great seaside view along with the downtown Tampa skyline. \n\nInside is where things start to fall apart. I arrived around 6:00pm, about an hour after they had opened. Most of the servers were standing around and shooting the breeze. There was only one other party there other than myself, so I can forgive them for being bored until the restaurant filled up, but at least try to look busy.\n\nOn the website, they advertised pizza and subs along with traditional Italian restaurant fare. Since I was just looking for a quick bite to eat before a show, I figured I could just get a small pizza and be on my way. Upon being seated, I was only given the traditional menu and was told that the pizza ovens weren't even on yet, but I could order a pizza but it would take longer than usual. Ok, I get that I was in there not too long after opening, but I felt they should have at least had all aspects of the menu ready to go if they're going to start opening the doors for customers. I didn't feel like irritating the staff to go turn on the pizza oven when they weren't prepared to, as well as waiting longer than usual for my meal, so I just opted for a simple plate of spaghetti and meatballs.\n\nI know not all Italian restaurants follow the same practices and principles, but I was disappointed with what That's Amore offered. I was given a basket of \"garlic bread\", but I'll be damned if I could find any trace of garlic or butter. There was barely any. The oil and vinaigrette dip saved what was essentially just plain old bread with a touch of garlic and maybe butter if I squinted hard enough.\n\nNo house salad before the meal. Again, I know not all Italian restaurants follow the same formula, but still, a small salad before the main course is pretty standard in Italian restaurants as well as family dinners.\n\nWhen I finally got my spaghetti and meatballs, I realized I was about to pay $20 for something I could have bought in a can. The meatballs were obviously frozen and reheated, the sauce was bland (again, lack of garlic), and the pasta barely managed to squeak by. My server was friendly but I could tell he wasn't used to serving lone diners killing time before a rock show.\n\nThe atmosphere tries to be a fancy Italian joint, but since the staff seemingly had some downtime, I overheard many conversations about paychecks and gossip. I'm normally ok with that if it's done out of the range of customers, but when it's near the front of the house, it sounds straight up like some Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares stuff. \n\nA rough translation of \"That's amore\" from Italian to English means \"That's love\". I really wasn't feeling the love with this place. The food was mediocre at best. But, they have room to improve and shine. Like I said earlier, their location is prime. I'd recommend using fresher ingredients and add a kick to the marinara, and this place could elevate itself.

I love Tria enough to venture the whole way to other side of the river to try out their new celebration of fermentation at Biba.\n\nI had been awaiting the opening of Biba for months, but it looks like the delays in set-up were worth it based on the beautiful space they have created in the West Bank building.  I got the feeling of industrial warehouse meets rustic farmhouse meets hi-tech wine bar.  Somehow, they pulled these themes into a cohesive blend of glassed-in wine cellar, rustic casks, exposed ductwork, and lots of striking wood.  The attention to detail shines through from the carefully selected light fixtures to the aesthetically pleasing (if horrifyingly dangerous looking) red-enameled meat slicer.  The plans to replace the current front windows with ones that open completely to the sidewalk will really open up the space.  There were plenty of seats available when I arrived at 6:00 on a Tuesday evening, but the place became comfortably full pretty quickly.\n\nThe food menu is quite similar to Tria with some overlap in the offerings (selection of cheeses, fig-based morsels, paninis, salads, snacks, etc.).  Obviously the focus for many of the dishes is showcasing spectacular cheeses in thoughtful ways.  I had time for just a quick bite on my way to the theater, and I chose to embrace this new location by trying some of the items least like those I have seen at Tria: the asparagus with hazelnuts and lemon oil, and the beef carpaccio with Pecorino Tartufello that I had been fantasizing about since reading Eva H's review.  Both were stellar.  The carpaccio was some of the best I've had - high quality beef rendered into silk-like sheets that melted instantly on your tongue.  The earthy truffle-goodness of the rich cheese was offset nicely by the peppery arugula and cut through with the piquancy of a light lemon oil drizzle.\n\nThe two glasses of wine that I enjoyed with my treat were standbys from Tria.  Most of the list looked familiar, and I agree that adding descriptions to the menu would be helpful.  If space is the issue, they could even be in a tiny font to go with the mini-Tria feel.\n\nWhile I had an outstanding experience, I am not sure how often I will frequent Biba.  The reasons are primarily geographical since I have to literally walk past either of the Tria locations (and then keep walking for another 13 blocks) to get to there from my home.  The menu similarity to Tria makes it difficult to motivate myself; however, I suspect I will occasionally forge the mighty Schuykill to have more of that carpaccio.", "date": "2010-10-13 13:36:21"}, {"_key": "1013496", "_id": "reviews/1013496", "_rev": "_fNyrykm--Y", "review_id": "qwcYRuMg36vPjE7v_knecA", "user_id": "NUtIAX-ygn474tDg5nmesg", "business_id": "bmrEQ_4nzXc72zAFotrLYA", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "This is my favorite theater in Philadelphia.

It's really easy to miss if you don't pay attention when driving. I stopped by there today to get my Step-Dad a birthday present (shhh it's a surprise). I shopped at another comic book store by the AMC Regency 20 for Father's Day, but their selection was limited and the store was cramped so I wanted to try out this place after hearing about it from a fellow Yelper.\n\nThe place is larger than it's AMC 20 competitor and has a huge selection of comics. I wandered the store for about forty minutes. Checking out their wide selection of graphic novels (all 25% off too - sweet) and comic books. They had all the major superhero comic book collections and in the back I even found a 20th anniversary Sonic the Hedgehog book that I happily bought. I couldn't help but notice some superhero lights in the back, especially the batman light (one of my favorite superheroes next to Daredevil).   \n\nThe owner was really helpful and suggested quite a few comic books to me. I eventually decided on an Avengers graphic novel for my Step-Dad and bought myself a Spider-Man graphic novel as well as the Sonic comic.

The wall sitting can get a little tight next to other diners at different tables but if you're comfortable with close(r) quarters, it's nothing to complain over! \n\n    Of course I was smitten with the mason jar water glasses, the peels on the wall wishing \"La Bocca Del Lupo\" and other best wishes to the Craft team upon their opening--that's a great touch, it shows what a community not only Gerard Craft, but the St. Louis dining scene has created. \n\n     Our waitress brought water, and my Chianti-like red wine over immediately, with fresh, warm bread to boot.

I really enjoyed my bagel eggs Benedict (yes the eggs Benedict is made with bagels, and why would I try a dish with anything but a bagel in it for my first visit given that bagel is in the name of the restaurant??!?) -- I had the tomato bacon cheese one, and it was marvelous! So often I go to restaurants and ask for a soft poached egg only to receive it overcooked. This place did an excellent job with the food. Not only was it cooked properly but it tasted great and it was ample in quantity. I really loved the selection of fruit on my plate too -- it isn't often I get starfruit on my plate! And the breakfast potatoes were actually good enough that I ate them all!\n\nNow this restaurant is a bit old school when it comes to payment (they will NOT split the cheque if you're paying by debit or credit so plan accordingly). And there are sort of passive aggressive signs throughout the restaurant warning you of various things. And service is kind of slow (which surprised me seeing as my table was one of TWO tables in the restaurant that were in use during my visit). I mean these factors wouldn't keep me from visiting again, but I think it's noteworthy to remember that service isn't fast and to prepare for this when you do visit. \n\nThis restaurant has been in existence for a VERY LONG time in Edmonton. It is easy to access via transit as it isn't far from Whyte Avenue. There is ample parking in the nearby side streets as well.

I've fortunately never encountered a weekday wait over 15 minutes (chalk that up to high dining room turnover), but I shudder to think how murderously long the weekend brunch waits are at this extremely popular spot.\n\nThe food that draws the crowds is, surprisingly, not as good as one would expect given the restaurant's reputation as a brunch mecca. Most of it is decent, but I've had better renditions of most of Sabrina's specialties at other brunch spots that possess shorter or equivalent wait times. This phenomenon mostly stems from somewhat ambitious dishes that underdeliver and uniformly leaden food that leaves you unpleasantly bloated.\n\nFor example, a recent Mexican special promised chipotle-marinated flank steak atop a masa and red bean cake, crowned with two fried eggs, salsa verde, and cotija cheese. Though delicious in theory, the flank steak was butchered improperly and overcooked to the texture of shoe leather, with a masa cake as dry as biscotti. The eggs, salsa, and accompanying breakfast potatoes were good enough to save the plate, but it still disappointed.\n\nOn a positive note, vegetarians do quite well at Sabrina's, as it carries a superlative, vegetarian chicken cheesesteak, a huge and tasty hummus platter, and other herbivore friendly fare. Sweets are also fine here, as the stuffed French toast specials always satisfy. Again, these dishes still suffer from that odd tendency to leave one's stomach feeling iffy. As such, if I'm with vegetarians, if it's a weekday, and if I have enough time to take a nap afterwards, Sabrina's very well may be an option for brunch.

While there's plenty to love, one of my biggest complaints (having come here from California) is the lack of affordable, quality gyms. I'm used to mega gyms where you have lots of space to work out, where you don't have to fight for machines, where there are free classes included in your membership, and where membership doesn't cost a significant amount of your income. \n\nAlas, what passes for a quality gym in the South does not not cut it for me. I'm not even an avid athlete, but it annoys me when I get charged a lot and the gym insists on debiting my checking account as if I'm going to rip them off or something. \n\nAnyways, Gym Matrix is the first gym I've encountered in the South that doesn't have any silly rules like \"this is a no judgement zone\" or silly add-ons I'd never use like tanning or a movie theater. Also, they're open 24 hours (members can enter with a special key fob). The equipment is clean and modern. And the gym has the bare essentials, so you can pretty much work out ever muscle group you would want to, even though you may not see the particular machine you want. \n\nI like that their cardio machines each offer working cable television screens. \n\nHowever, I dislike that that the gym is relatively small. Luckily, it seems that gym membership is something of a luxury down here, so they gym is never overly-crowded and I haven't had to fight for machines yet. \n\nAlso, they charge extra for classes, which they consider \"one-on-one\" personal training. \n\nFinally, I like the fact that they gym has a staff person on duty during certain hours, but the fact that the gym is so small makes me feel self-conscious, like I'm being watched or chaperoned. I'd much prefer for someone to be on duty but have a bigger space so I don't have to make eye contact with the person on duty every time I change exercises. \n\nIn short, this gym leaves a lot to be desired (if you have a strong opinion about how gyms should be) but overall, it's the best one I've come across in the New Orleans area, so I'll just have to make due.", "date": "2012-03-08 19:02:50"}, {"_key": "1015536", "_id": "reviews/1015536", "_rev": "_fNyryoa--I", "review_id": "tRSsFAzP8DX2jCTwM5wlqg", "user_id": "idlL-0UBG9PVrdJf32_fSA", "business_id": "wazRghDjVEiSzTt9WXCPOA", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "My friend and I were searching for the best soul food in the city.

We tried the 'conservative' approach to no avail in building up the scar tissue.  We met with Dr. Boulay, and Petunia immediately loved him (guess he got a good vibe) which makes any fur parent happy.  We did our research and Dr. Boulay had incredibly strong and awesome training, academic background and reputation.  Yes, you pay for the consult -- it is a specialty center people.  Just like going to the doctor.  What I loved with the surgery estimate was it was all inclusive -- meaning it included everything and that also means all the aftercare and follow-up appointments.  You know what you are paying going in with no hidden surprises.  The surgery went very well, aftercare instructions very detailed and all post appointments including xray covered in the price we paid at surgery.  Petunia even needed an extra appointment to follow up and it was covered.  Surgery a success and Dr. Boulay was awesome, and unfortunately since retired.\n\nFast forward, our girl ended up needing TPLO on the other rear leg just recently.  We consulted with the Dr McCalley, and he ended up doing our girls surgery.  In addition, he was kind enough to remove the plate in the original leg (since it was completely healed and was no longer needed) at no cost to us.  We had a quote for 350 to do this from a few months prior since the plate seemed to maybe be bothering her.  The surgery and first post op appointment went off without a hitch.

Not so much.\n\nWe finished our hike and I got sad that it was over.  I sort of wanted to go around the trail one more time, but my friend just looked at me like I was crazy.

Also enjoyed the coffee, and appreciate that they have almond milk as an option.\n\nService: It was super busy on a Sunday morning, and we were tag-teamed by someone who was probably a hostess and our server. The hostess was great about checking in with folks about how their coffee was doing and reassuring people that food was on its way; our server, Talbert, was just wonderful. He knew the menu, answered questions, checked on us from time to time but also left us to enjoy our meal. He was polite, but not overly solicitous -- really good at his job!\n\nA note about timing -- we went right when it opened, and already the place was starting to fill up, so for brunch at least, you'll want to go early.

No. But they make a formidable cheese steak. \n\nThe key to any great cheese steak is the roll and this shop gets Amorosa rolls sent from up north.

I fell in love with a certain design, but my fiance wasn't sold, so we decided to do the rest of our errands and think about it. He told me it wasn't about what he wanted, but what I wanted, so we went back to ask some more questions about sizing and financing. Emily was great. I was hoping to not have to special order, but my finger is between a 4-4.25, and the ring could not be sized down that much. Plus, with a special order, we were able to get a setting that would exactly fit the stone, reducing the chances of it cracking during the mounting process.

It has a very loft-y feel with exposed brick and ductwork. The space was bright and clean.\n\nAll their pizzas are 12\", just perfect for two people to share. Plus, they offer some tempting appetizers and salads, sandwiches and desserts. I was impressed with the variety of non-pizza options on their menu and can't wait to go back and try some of their sandwiches and the spinach artichoke dip.\n\nThe salads come in two sizes and I tried the house salad and the husband had the BLT. The house was really good, but I wish they would chop up the onions a bit. No complaints about the BLT either and I know he appreciated the blue cheese crumbles on top of what is otherwise iceberg lettuce with ranch.\n\nPW offers a load of specialty pizzas so getting half and half is no problem. We went with half Wolf (sausage, pepperoni, bacon, caramelized onion, green pepper, roasted garlic) and half Pulled Piggy (house bbq sauce, pulled pork, caramelized onion, slaw & gruyere). Yum!! The pulled piggy definitely stole the show. The only thing that could have made it better would be to add some extra bbq sauce on top of the pork to make it a little more barbequey. The Wolf was pretty good, but about half the bacon wasn't cooked enough so instead of crisply bacon crumbles, there were fatty bacon hunks. Needless to say, I had to pick all those off. And if I'm going to be really picky there were some globs of sauce that needed to be spread out more. But overall they were both good and I'd for sure get the pulled piggy again.\n\nThe crust actually reminded me a little bit of Dewey's in that it was a little buttery and garlicky. It was thinner and crispier, but definitely similar.\n\nThere were about five different dessert options and I couldn't pass up the pecan pie. We split a piece that was definitely big enough to share.

I really did. I love the concept...sit-down restaurant quality burgers done fast with a fresh topping bar so you can dress your burger any way you want. Unfortunately the focus only seems to be on quickness\n\nFirst off, you must know that the people behind Cheeseburger Charley's were the same people that started O'Charley's. Say what you will about O'Charley's, no restaurant chain has that level of success without doing SOMETHING right. I guess what I'm trying to get at is that the concept is solid. The execution was lacking.\n\nI ordered the 'beefalo' burger, which is what I understand to be female buffalo bred to 'normal' bovine bulls. It is supposed to be leaner than regular ground beef, but not as gamey or lean as straight ground buffalo. I'd never had 'beefalo' before, so I was excited. Unfortunately, leaner only meant dry. I was able to watch the burger being cooked, so I have a fair amount of insight as to why. First, the grill cook pressed the absolute hell out of the burger with the spatula. Yes, doing this cooks the burger faster, but sacrifices all the delicious beefy juices that make the burger great. Second, instead of using the insulating dome alone to melt the cheese, the grill cook used it to further speed the cooking process, squirting water underneath the dome to create steam that speeds cooking, at the cost of ever more flavor as the water draws out the moisture and salt from the burger patty. What could have been an excellent burger was rendered near-inedible by a grill cook who obviously cared not about the taste and only about the speed of preparation. My wife's 'normal' ground beef mushroom and swiss burger was treated in the same manner, but the higher fat content of her burger meant that it was at least edible, but in all honesty, it was still pretty dry. \n\nIn short, the concept is great, but the execution needs some work.

Late in the sense that the times I went to this establishment it was still Jolli Mons. Upon finally locking the establishment, the initial issue is parking, unless you live close enough to walk or bike. Parking is obnoxiously  difficult with tow signs everywhere,  it leaves you with a real head scratcher and impending sense of doom, that your car will be gone when you return after a few alcoholic beverages.\nInside is an empty shell, with a small nondescript  bar, some booths and empty space & walls. Nothing to go out of your way to visit. \nEnter the back patio and discover paradise. You can see the Pinellas trail. The landscaping is lush & welcoming. There is a covered porch with tables crowded in, like you are in a community hall. Once you get used to the cramped quarters, you have hopefully had a beer or glass of wine and met your nieghbors. Much better, now you can settle in and feel at home, surrounded by friends. No need to ask a server for salt, just ask your table friend from next to you.\nI love the chill outdoor vibe. So relaxing, refreshing and unpretentious. Simply original and laid back. I Bo not & never will enjoy drinking out of plastic cups. I am not much of a beer drinker, and the plastic cup does no favors to an already  cheap wine.\nI have tried the food on 2 occasions and let's  just say this is not their forte. Personally I now abstain from their food, as I hate to throw away money.\nThey have some terrific  live bands & what a great spot to enjoy live music, you can even bring your 4 legged  family members.  You are surrounded by nature and your new friends all digging the music. Being outside give the music a nice tone and quality. Since space is a premium, there is literally  dancing in the streets or any surface without tables you can find.\nIt really is a great way to spend a nice weekend  day or any evening that they have entertainment.  When you leave you are nice and relaxed from the fantastic setting, fresh air, good music & new nieghbors. A little bit of the Islands, right here at home.\nWhat's  a  girl  to  do?

The bad news is that everyone decided to come and that wreaked havoc on the service.

I love everything about this restaurant and it is the single thing I miss the most about Philadelphia (I no longer live there). \n\nThe food is absolutely amazing.  Amada is the restaurant that introduced me to Spanish cuisine.  Before Amada, I seriously didn't know that Spain had such amazing food.  My boyfriend had lived in Spain, so he told me how authentic the dishes were.  Because of Amada, I actually had to go to Spain just to try the food and it was the catalyst to 6 weeks of travels and lots of eating in Spain.  That should really tell you how amazing the food is.  I even started learning Spanish, okay that was a bit overboard, but yes I can def say all my favorite dishes in Spanish.\n\nThe atmosphere is also amazing because tapas isn't a luxury dining experience in Spain, it's pretty much like our bar food.  What I actually really love about Amada is that you get amazing authentic food in the midst of Spanish atmosphere taken up a notch to match the rest of Philly trendy dining.  And frankly the price is amazing.  Especially after living in NY.  Spending $130-$150 for two in Amada, that includes a pitcher of sangria (which is also amazing) is just unmatched and it's so worth it.\n\nI absolutely love this restaurant so I will now just write down some of my favorite dishes there that I think anyone must try.\n\nJamon serrano - very famously Spanish\nManchego cheese with apples - so amazing and I also love the presentation\nGambas al ajillo - pretty good, not the same as Spain but pretty good\nPretty much the whole menu is delicious!\n\nOf the many times I've been there, I think the only dish I was ever disappointed with there was the paella valenciana, would recommend against it.  \n\nIf you get overwhelmed by the menu, just get the tasting menu.

As soon as I walked in, I just KNEW it was going to be great.

First, have fun picking just one of the 7 amazing chicken flavours (hint, come with friends so you can share flavours).  I opted for the cilantro lime, which was amazing.

For my sides, I choose TWO corn fritters because I seen a picture of them and knew one wouldn't be enough (one was enough, but I was happy for the second one). I also ordered the \"10 oz\" Mac'n'cheese Pesto (Seoul legitimately named the dish \"10oz mac'n'cheese\")... but when I got home I could tell it was not even close to 10 ounces. Food scale said it was 6.2oz. Don't rip me off, Seoul!! . Tisk, tisk.  But you know what? The food is so good that I don't even dock a star for that. Better not happen again. Next time, I'm bringing my food scale in my purse. (I'm totally kind of kidding). \n\nThe CHICKEN portions are so generous. I mean, do NOT order a 10 piece chicken unless you are either a) a guy/girl with a hollow leg or b) a group of 2-4 people. When they handed me my box of chicken and the lid wouldn't close, I knew that was a good sign!! They have 5 piece combos as well. All the food I ordered was $23, and would've fed two normal people very easily. I'm going to have leftovers for two days. But no leftover mac'n'cheese unfortunately. \n\nWhen you do come here, because you will, plan to get take-out as there are only 4 tables and a small counter.

By the end of the meal, after he had dropped our check, he completely disappeared.  We sat, chatted and finished our wine for about 15 minutes, and he never returned.  I don't know what Peter Woolsey looks like, but an authoritative-looking guy from the kitchen in a chef's jacket was bantering with the bartender, so there was no hope of getting anyone's attention over there, and we eventually were able to flag down another server to pay our bill.

To be honest, I wasn't expecting much, despite the other great reviews. From viewing the menu on the restaurant's FB page and seeing photos of the interior, I was expecting it to be hyped up and self-important. While some aspects of the restaurant were confounding (the menu is rather vague, prices for specials aren't listed or quoted, entrees and sides must be ordered separately yet this is never mentioned anywhere), overall I was charmed by the service and flavors of this great place. \n\nThe interior is clean and spacious, and the service was welcoming and fast. I love that they have a big glass bottle of water on the table that gets refilled as necessary, and that there are so many great cocktails and beers to choose from on the menu. We had the cheese plate, which was overpriced yet delicious ($12 for four very thin pieces of cheese, a few pieces of good, chewy bread, some chutney, candied pecans, and a few crackers). I ordered one of the specials, drum with fried oysters and a slice of fried couscous cake served with spicy mayo. My friend got the goat tacos, and we shared bites. The drum was great, but again a very small serving for the price (3 oysters and the fish was maybe about three and a half inches square). The goat tacos were on point - amazingly delicious and at $8, right on target for price. \n\nFor dessert we shared the special strawberry shortcake, which was nice but too dry and bread-y for me. The whipped cream was great, but I just like my strawberry shortcake a little more juicy. Next time I'm going to have to go with my original choice, the blood orange custard, and definitely try out the steamed mussels as an appetizer. Also, one of our friends advised us to try the brussel sprouts, which I didn't but wish I had - a nearby table got some and I was immediately jealous when I caught sight of them.\n\nIf the service hadn't been so great, I might have marked this down to three stars based on price and small serving sizes, but overall I was pretty happy with this place.", "date": "2012-03-04 04:46:56"}, {"_key": "1018552", "_id": "reviews/1018552", "_rev": "_fNyryva--c", "review_id": "a2JdbhKe-tDZHYXx0zqR2Q", "user_id": "Lr9A78QDWwm-vUinXcKXdA", "business_id": "ua1YA7YW14vnfhIAobeCaA", "stars": 3, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This year's race featured a \"corral\"---but only for those that could run a 10k under 43 minutes--so sub 7 minutes.

Very relaxed atmosphere and the restaurant is very minimalist, by that I mean very clean and simple but in that quaint type of French way. Not that the Marc is that french but you know what I'm trying to get at.\n\nAnyways, place was pretty busy for a Monday night. Two of us decided to try their set menu while the other two ordered off the regular one. This is what we ordered:\n\nSet Menu ($25)\n- Caloo verde - good starter with a kale type puree and manila clams. The puree/sauce was delicious when dipped with the complimentary house bread.\n- Pork loin - pork was cooked nice and tenderly (which I know is tricky to do with pork cuts). The dish also came with chickpeas, spinach, chermoula and a mustard type sauce. Pretty good but the chick peas were a tad on the dry side after eating everything else.\n- Ile Flottante - meringue with red currant, pistachio and creme anglaise. The red currants had a nice, slightly sour/bitterness to it that went complemented the meringue perfectly. Originally thought they were some sort of berry.\n\nRegular menu\nMy two friends shared:\n- Steak tartare ($12) - comes with crostini bread. They said it was only okay, the steak tartare was a bit off for them texturally.\n- Entrecote Frites ($29) - ribeye steak and arugula, parmesan salad with fries. Fries are apparently one of the top 25 dishes in Edmonton (voted by the people). We didn't think they were that amazing but that's just our opinion. Good but nothing mind blowing.\n\nMy other friend and I shared/I ate the rest of her dish after she was stuffed silly.\n- Seared duck breast ($26) - nice tender duck breast slices with a Grand Marnier reduction. Came with puy lentils which were delicious! Also a bit of carrots. This dish was great - the only minor qualm we had was that the sauce mixed in the with the rest of the lentils/vegetables and that caused the dish to be really salty.\n- Beignets ($7-8) - I LOVE beignets. There were two sauces and about 7-8 beignets that we shared. These were pretty good but according to my friend whose had them several times, they are usually much much better.\n\nOverall, we had a great meal at The Marc and I would recommend it if your looking for a nice place to have dinner.

I hate waiting in lines. I know that most restaurants don't actually make you wait in line, at least not in the way they did in grade school, where I was initially set upon the path of hating to queue. Nonetheless, if I walk into a restaurant because I am hungry, I want to be able to eat now, or at least be seated and able to place my order. I know this is \"unreasonable\" to some, but, if I am told there is a thirty minute or hour long wait for a table, my mind immediately begins to calculate the driving time to other nearby restaurants where the wait may not be as long. \n\nBut, I digress...\n\nOne of the main reasons I love Past Perfect is that no matter what event is happening or whatever time of day, you can usually sit down at a table immediately; I've never personally experienced a wait longer than five minutes. Sure, a couple of times we had to eat at the bar because the restaurant was woefully understaffed, but even while understaffed the bartender provided excellent service and our food was served quickly. \n\nOh, I nearly forgot the food. They have an eclectic assortment of items on the menu; I'd worked my way about halfway down the burger list when one night I decided to listen to my wife's suggestion and try the meatloaf with spaghetti. I know, I know --meatloaf with spaghetti? Don't knock it until you've tried it, ladies and gents. The meatloaf is subtly spicy and incorporates a blend of fresh herbs that I have nearly completely identified and been able to replicate at home. The pasta is always al dente and the dish is covered in Parmesan. I'm nearly salivating just thinking about it as I type. \n\nThe drinks are yet another reason to come. They have a great deal of liquor infusions with ingredients more varied than you can imagine. The bartenders combine them into classic cocktails that are a little on the pricey side, but I almost always have at least one Sazerac. \n\nIn short, Past Perfect is great for before or after a downtown event. The menus, both food and drink, are eclectic and reasonably priced.

On the other hand, the first time, I skipped slaw based on appearances.  It was creamy and looked overdressed.  I just assumed it would be very sweet.  I was wrong.  It has a very nice vinegar component in the dressing and is now what I get every time.

In this review she wittingly chose the verb \"polished\" to describe her most recent experience devouring a 1/4 lb burger (and accompanied fries). What's funny about this mental image to me, is if you saw her, you'd wonder where she fit it all. I mean, she literally is the quintessential poster child for what a gorgeous petite woman should look like. \n\nWhat does all this have to do with Peter Piper Pizza, you ask? Well, let me tell you! \n\nA long, long time ago, in a land not so far away (about 500 miles to be exact), two girls (let's call them Naomi & Rebecca) met up frequently for social outings together. These outings weren't like that of most other girls. They didn't sip on cosmopolitan martinis in some fancy New York sky scraper like Carrie & Miranda. They didn't get pedicures together at some fancy resort. They didn't go to a blow out bar and get their hurr did (Naomi mostly did that solo & Rebecca was too broke at the time). No, these girls were different. \n\nWhen they went out, they met up at Peter Piper Pizza where together, these two \"polished\" off a large pepperoni pizza and a basket of buffalo wings. They didn't care about the P.O.S. carousel there or the alluring ski ball games. They didn't care about the child cootie-soaked carpet beneath their feet or the useless waste-of-space plastic prizes. All they cared about was their pizza and the time they got to spend together eating it. By the time they left, Rebecca practically had to be rolled out of the joint, kind of like Violet from Willie Wonka... and Naomi always skipped out with childlike energy....again wondering, where does she fit it all? (Jealous!) \n\nThe moral of this story? Well, there's a few. The first is size doesn't matter, unless of course you're a guy, and I'm sad to say you'll be battling that one for the bulk of your life. The second is that no matter where you go, spending time with someone you love can make a 3 star place into a 5 star experience. And lastly, Peter Piper Pizza has some damn yummy pizza!\n\nThanks for the nostalgia, Naomi.

The items we chose spanned the spectrum of dishes offered: spicy lamb, spinach chicken, rare beef and the vegetable combo. Since all the food is freshly prepared after you order, it does take a few minutes to get your food but it's well worth it - everything tasted fresh, carefully prepared and authentic. The platter even looked stunning, with the meat dishes in the center and the vegetable combo dispersed in segments around the parameter. The lamb, greens and the lentils were favorites but everything was great. Our friendly waiter explained everything and checked on us frequently - great service. \n\nThe food was delicious, we tried each dish by themselves and mixed some things together to further excite our taste buds. They give you some condiments that enhance the experience: a green pepper sauce, red pepper sauce (I think it was cayenne - very hot and tasty) and some crumbled cheese that was a lot like feta.\n\nBe sure to order the coffee ceremony when you order your food - they will roast the beans and bring them to your table so you can enjoy the smell before they grind it up and serve the thick and amazing elixir, served with popcorn!\n\nWe loved this place - if you have had Ethiopian food before, this will rank among the best, if you haven't tried it before then do yourself a favor and try this unique dining experience and amazing food.

The chicken isn't super hot, but most people (like me) can't handle true Nashville hot, so the flavor is perfect.

If Rednecks don't hunt, don't fish, don't wear cowboy hats or cowboy boots or chew.  Ok...I guess I'm about as redneck as one can be if one stands in the sun too long without sunscreen.  But I do listen to country music on occasion!  Does that qualify for me to write a review about a joint like Gilley's?\n\nAnyway.  The first time we came here was for a Free VIP party.  My second time here was to buy their quality drinks at a reasonable price in a casino.  My third time.  Yes, I've been THREE times this week.  My third time was for a real sit down meal and drinks of course.\n\nI'm not going to bore you with my step by step experiences but I will give you my overall take on the property.\n\nThe atmosphere of this place is....hickafied Outback....on steroids.  They have lots and lots of bar space but the bar space isn't as usable as a normal bar because there is also lots and lots of bar top \"poker\" machines.  So it still gets a bit crowded trying to get to the bar and of course no eating there.  However they do have lots of bar seating with decent tables.  Tables that you can only eat appetizers at, so be forewarned full menu is only available in the dining room.\n\nAs others have said, smoking is through most of the establishment with the exception of the back dining area.  So bringing your kids might be a little complicated unless you know you can be seated immediately.\n\nThey have a mechanical Bull!!  Not my thing so if it is yours, check out a few other reviews about that...I know Ly S. rode it.\n\nAnother thing others have mentioned is the small dance floor.  The dance floors are almost always too small but this one does seem unusually small for a floor that is expected to see line dancing.  But what do I know, I don't line dance.\n\nI enjoyed my medium rare top sirloin steak.  So much so that if they can duplicate this experience in the future, this will be my \"go to\" steak place when I go out for a steak.  The cut was awesome and it was just slightly undercooked from Medium rare which I loved.  Normally I have to settle for a poorly cooked medium rare but this was right to my liking.  I ordered up the smoked corn and peppers as a side and the other side was the beans.  Personally I wasn't a fan at all of the corn, but my wife liked it so much she finished it.  Too smokey.  Beans were slightly sweet but not too much and thick.\n\nThe drinks I have had here over the three nights were really really good, at a really reasonable pricepoint of $6.50 for their signature cocktails.  I've had the Revolver, Knocked Up, I80, Texas Tramp, Arbuckle's Boilermaker and the Bone Orchard off the signature menu and all have pleased.  I also had the Bloody Mary...these have come 3 different ways from 3 different bartenders so they probably haven't nailed that one down yet, and just a note, the last one was the best because of the spiced rim they put on the glass.  The drinks are good and balanced, with the exception of the Knocked Up..that one is more of a dessert cocktail, but in my opinion its the best.\n\nThe prices can be seen on their menu.  Very reasonable prices here...hopefully those will remain for awhile while they build up their clientele.  Also check out the receipt photo of my dinner if you want to get an idea of what it costs for two people to have a meal.  And note, it seems they have to charge an additional 10% entertainment tax here so that might explain the lower costs for everything, they need to keep it competitive.  \n\nNow don't get me wrong.  There were a few kinks; collard greens were a bit salty, I was passed over at the bar a number of times, the noise level is borderline abusive, but those kinks should disappear while they move into their 2nd week and further.\n\nI of course look forward to heading back here on the regular...this will especially be a great place to get a quality cocktail for a reasonable price while on the Nugget Property for any activity.  I just have to make sure I'm there after 5.\n\nOh and when we left at about 7:00 the line was already stacked up deep for entrance into the bar.", "date": "2014-06-15 22:50:58"}, {"_key": "1019765", "_id": "reviews/1019765", "_rev": "_fNyryxq--V", "review_id": "50tjBHnmHK146jaDo-T1Ew", "user_id": "FmV8rduy7MFsXm0xjZsweA", "business_id": "YqmClmk7oLcDzPWKHzgA-Q", "stars": 4, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Came to visit here with some friends, one of which lived in the area.\n\nThe service was friendly, knowledgable, and helpful.

And it was adorable. \n\nI might be spoiled when I go into the city (NY and Philly), since there are a plethora of great sushi places that I can choose from - even for delivery. However, back at my parents' place in ol' West Chester, the options are rather limited. So, from the limited options here, Fusion Asian has won my heart.\n\nI came with a friend, and was a little confused to find the place since I was looking for a sign that read \"FUSION ASIAN\", not just \"FUSION\" and then some other words after? But it was no big deal, it's in the West Goshen plaza, if you ever have a hard time finding it. The actual place itself was nice, although the decorations inside were a little confused. Our waitress allowed us to choose our own seats, and immediately offered us wine glasses when she saw that we had brought a bottle. We also asked for sake cups (we also brought sake), and an ice bucket, and she obliged us, almost immediately. \n\nWe took a while to order - we didn't realize that there was a House Special Roll menu, so we were poring over the special rolls on the regular menu. I was a little disappointed because a majority of them were 'cooked' rolls. Not to worry, the house special menu had a lot more raw fish in their rolls. They have decently priced a la carte items, and sushi/sashimi entrees. The menu says that they carry uni! I have had a hard time finding restaurants that actually have it. I was also delighted to see that they offered South East Asian items on their menu as well - I love Green Curry and perhaps I will be back just for that.\n\nThe food itself was good. We had the West Chester roll, the West Goshen roll, and the Fisherman roll. The plate came with a beautiful design - we were told it was chocolate sauce, mint sauce (to be honest, it tasted like tooth paste, so I avoided it), and a pineapple sauce. Seriously, so pretty. It was tough for us to finish everything we ordered, so they offered us boxes. They packed in ginger and wasabi, but no soy sauce (which is okay, since of course we have soy sauce at home). They brought out the check with orange pieces and tooth picks. A great fresh ending.\n\nHonestly, this place makes me pine for my favorites back in the city, in a good way. Since I am living back at home, at least for now, this place is now my go-to for whenever my sushi craving hits (which is often). Affordable (not the cheapest, but agreeable) prices, good food, and friendly waitresses.\n\nOh, a final note: The 10% discount they offer on their website - you must PRINT it out to be able to use it.

And our visit to Tony's tops them all (no surprise)!\n\nI have lived in St. Louis all my life and have known since I was young that there the  best restaurant in town is Tony's.  I have wanted to take my wife to Tony's for a while, and we finally visited this weekend, to celebrate the anniversary of the first time we both said \"I love you,\" 18 years ago.  We can now confirm that what we understood is true - Tony's is clearly the best restaurant in St. Louis, and is the finest we have dined at in any city.\n\nWe arrived unexpectedly early and they nicely, and quickly, accommodated.  While I was not surprised that the host helped my wife to her seat (they were waiting for her as she arrived at our table, forgoing my plans to help her to her seat), I was pleasantly surprised to have my own seat pulled out for me, a first for me in any restaurant.\n\nWe were introduced to Ken (to call Ken a \"server\" does not do him justice; perhaps \"gracious host\" is more appropriate, but still seemingly inadequate) and he provided for a fantastic dinner, helping with wine pairings, helping serve each course by warming everything right there at the cart by our table, and making sure we had a wonderful night.\n\nThe night was great because we were together... in an amazing restaurant.  And the food... I truly cannot do justice in words to how good it was.  But I will try:\n\nWe shared two appetizers:\n- Angnollotti with Prosciutto - made completely in-house, these were similar in shape to stuffed raviolis, but that is where the comparison ends... these tasted far superior than I can express in words\n- Seared Scallops with Black Truffles - equally amazing\n\nWe also shared two amazing entrees:\n- My wife enjoyed the Lobster Albanello, with its amazingly rich cream sauce \n- I enjoyed the Veal Loin Chop with the Black Truffle Sauce; quite thick, and wonderfully tender; the sauce was an amazing compliment\n\nThe lobster and veal were amazing on their own, and were even better paired, as we shared with each other throughout the meal.\n\nMy wife enjoyed a side of steamed vegetables and I ordered creamed spinach.\n\nI have always enjoyed spinach and must note that this was by far the best I have had anywhere... likely the best vegetable I have ever enjoyed.  There are many flavors at work, and I highly recommend the spinach when you visit (and I never imagined that I would ever recommend spinach to anyone).\n\nFor dessert, my wife enjoyed the Triple Chocolate Torte and I had one of the two specials - the Almond Butter ice cream and torte.  WOW.   The flavors in the house-made ice cream were so right... then complimented with the almond butter sauce, and the sauce was also baked inside the torte.  I don't think I have had almond butter before, and am quite confident not many other ways of preparing it could compare to this fine dessert.\n\nWe paired the appetizers with a Pinot Grigio, and for the main course my wife enjoyed a Pinot Noir and, thanks to Ken's recommendation, I enjoyed an Amarone.\n\n\nThanks to Ken and others on the staff, we had a great night.\n\nWe knew of Tony's four diamond status, and they live up to it:\n\"Distinctive fine-dining. Creative preparations, skillfully served, often with wine steward, amid upscale ambience.\"\nSource:  http://newsroom.aaa.com/diamond-ratings/diamond-rating-definitions/\n\nI had been curious how fancy the service would be.

My usual Mexican restaurants are Carreta's Grill (Metairie), Juan's Flying Burrito (Mid City), and of course, Superior Grill. But this place had some really positive reviews and great pictures of Fajitas and Chile Rellenos, which are my ultimate weaknesses.\n\nThe restaurant is very clean and aesthetically pleasing, almost \"upscale\" by Mexican restaurant standards. I'm not sure what the whole aztec looking fountain is for in the back of the restaurant, but sure, I'll take it. \n\nWe got the Medium Top Shelf Margaritas, one frozen and one on the rocks, and they were pretty good. The frozen margarita was definitely much sweeter than the one on the rocks so I prefer the one on the rocks personally. I would say their margaritas are slightly better than the ones at Carreta's Grill but definitely no where near as good as Superior Grill.... but then again...what is better than a Superior Grill Margarita? I mean ain't nobody can compete with that.\n\nWe got my absolutely must-have order of Queso of course. I do like a good white quest and theirs was good but slightly more liquid than I'm used to. I like a nice creamy thick white queso but that's just me.\n\nWe split the Steak Fajitas for one, a Cheese Chile Relleno, and a Pork Tamale. Now not to brag or anything, but I am sort of a Chile Relleno connoiseaur. It's sort of the thing I order at every Mexican restaurant that I use to judge their food. A good Mexican place will do it right and if the Chile Relleno is not good than it's usually a sure bet that the rest of their food isn't up to standard either. Well, I happen to really LOVE their Chile Relleno, which made me really excited to try everything else we ordered. It was just what it should be, a nice ranchero sauce with cheese on top, flaky on the outside, but hot with runny cheese on the inside, a good size, and with a spicy kick. And yes, it MUST be all those things to win my favor. \n\nThe Fajitas for one are a HUGE portion and PLENTY for two people to split. I don't even know what the fajita plate for two could possibly look like. They give you TONS of meat and veggies on that skillet for two people! So I was really pleased with that because the fajitas are sort of my \"thing.\"\n\nI'm not a huge Tamale person but I tasted it and enjoyed it and my dining companion who happens to really love tamales said it was one of the better ones he has ever had, so that has to be saying something. \n\nOverall our server Alfredo (odd name for a Latino man right?) was very a nice man, but not super friendly or anything, just nice. He just sort of just took our order and brought us our food and checked on us once or twice that was that. However, I have no complaints about the service. \n\nWe did ask for hot sauce and as Bobby B. states, it is a house sauce concoction that is indeed not hot. Having said that, I think it was surely a flavorful sort of darker salsa, just not a spicy one. It did have a nice smokey flavor to it though. Alfredo said if we wanted a \"hot\" sauce that he could bring us some Tobasco Sauce, but I skipped that offer and just stuck with the house sauce instead. \n\nBottom line: It's a great little Mexican spot but I don't think that it is SO amazingly above standard that I would drive out to Kenner often to become a real regular. I think my Carreta's Grill down the street is just as good food-wise even though it's certainly not as pretty as this place. However, if I find myself in the area, I would definitely come again!

It's bright, well-decorated, and the perfect size. I even like the food court (which is rare for me). Normally I'm grossed out by the smell of all the food and grease, but Southgate's court must be especially well ventilated.\n\nThe variety of stores is one of the most important factors for me when determining how much I like a mall. Southgate really excels in this area. It has higher-end clothing/accessory stores like Michael Kors, BCBG, and Coach, and more affordable places like the Gap or Smart Set. I also LOVE that it has both a standalone MAC store and a Sephora.\n\nAnother thing I love is that this mall has a grocery store (Safeway) attached to it. I stop by the Safeway for a couple items every time I go to Southgate. It's a really convenient feature. I don't know if I'd want to utilize this Safeway regularly for large shopping trips as it's often fairly busy, but it isn't bad if you just have one or two things to pick up.\n\nWhy not five stars?

Granted, I only had a couple drinks and some appetizers, but I made a point to make my way over here after seeing them on Groupon.\n\nI was dating someone from Tampa when I saw the Groupon, but didn't buy it.  Fast forward several months and I investigated to figure out the name of this place because I remember the menu was very appealing.\n\nAfter a rainy day at the zoo and having not eaten, I decided now was the time to have an app or two and some drinks.  I sat at the bar and had the sweetest bartender!  I forgot her name, but she was great.  We chatted about Tampa and Chicago, she text her husband to ask where in Ybor they go and gave me tips on some places to check out.  \n\nThe food:  I tried the sweet plantains w/ pulled pork and the queso fundido.  Both were amazing.  I'm not a fan of sweet plantains because they're soft and if they're not cooked right, they're usually TOO soft.  I'm also not a huge fan of pork, but these sounded so good and they lived up to my expectations.  I think there was a coleslaw as well, and while I'm not a fan of coleslaw, this wasn't bad.  I also wanted to try something else and asked for her opinion on guacamole, calamari or queso fundido and the queso was the best I've ever had!\n\nDefinitely wasn't crazy about the idea of goat cheese being in there, but I figured I'd try it.  Like I said, the best I've ever had.  The chips were perfectly salty and combined with the cheese that was thick yet creamy....I didn't finish it but oh man, I wish I could have.\n\n\n\nThe drinks:  I had the sangria and some blended drink.  While I prefer white sangria, this was perfect.  Not overly fruity, not in a small glass and not overly strong.  The blended drink was so good I could have sucked down a few of those.  However, I had to drive a good 20 minutes back to Downtown Tampa, so I had to stop myself there.\n\nI met an older couple from the area who visit Chicago frequently, so it was a really pleasant experience sitting at the bar.

Waited to be seated, which happened right away. Then we didnt see our waitress till 10 mins for our drink ordered.\n\nOnce we put in that order another 10 mins just to receive our drinks. Sadly this place had only 2 waiters/waitress  (one of each). At times they had to cook. So were thinking management needs to figure this thing out. When we finally got a chance to ordered our meals it was another 20 mins of waiting for tge meals. So I'm thinking for future consumers order everything at once. \n\nThe food was bland no seasoning and came out luke warm. My wife just didn't eat, she took it home just to throw it away. Can't recall what we ordered  (besides the plantains) only thing that came out hot. So if your ever in this vicinity keep driving and don't think twice. Why should you have a bad experience while wasting money. \n\nIt just saddens me when people don't put no love in their business as well as there food.", "date": "2017-05-30 18:50:33"}, {"_key": "1021052", "_id": "reviews/1021052", "_rev": "_fNyry1y---", "review_id": "wdlJ4D7hjRIGTLMIihTvGw", "user_id": "O0tBJZz0uCYV-Pt7O0Oerg", "business_id": "6r9FNW0-4aKqbPCX7UxTZg", "stars": 3, "useful": 5, "funny": 4, "cool": 1, "text": "This restaurant is huge, I mean it's way too big for a little piece of Italy experience. Even worse is the waiting list if you don't reserve ahead of time. We went on a Saturday night fully prepared to wait an hour or so, but the hostess scared me with the 3hours waiting time!!! I was like WHOA, is that even possible? Feels like CheeseCake Factory experience!  MAGGIANOS is a chain folks so it's not your The HILLS authenticity. If you know what I mean. If you are from Saint Louis or NYC or Chicago, you might have to lower your mama's homemade Italian -expectations.\n\nAnyhow, I insisted my date to sit on the bar stools, it is first come first serve. You have to be fast and furious to snatch a seat at the bar or the area around the bar. I was on the PROWL for at least 10mins, and viola! ran for the first seats that were empty. I was excited , proud and ready for the menu.\n\nThe menu isn't as huge as the interior ,thank God! It's basically very simple but kind of pricey. We started off with half orders of calm in diablo sauce which had tons of garlic, yum,(NOT HOT at all)  and calamari fritte w/ marinara sauce. HALF order is the way to go, portions were huge! just like the size of the restaurant. If you come with a party of 3 or more then go for the full orders of apps and entrees! We had glasses of vino and Stella on draft. Reasonable price but the wine glass wasn't filled to the right amount ,it was less.The bar seating gets to be very uncomfortable and crowded with smoke hanging into thin air. It's not a romantic nor a family friendly place to sit, but we had no other choice. NO bars next time!\n\nNo other complains because the service was great and our server had her hands full. \n\nThe appetizers were accompanied with ciabatta bread and olive oil /vinegar. I love their warm soft ciabatta! For our entree we decided to share one since we wanted to have desserts as well. My date ordered the Beef stew special w/ cuscous and meledy of veggies that also came with a side of gorgonzola cheese. It was pretty good and extremely fulfilling. We needed a break before ordering desserts for sure, so we had another round of drinks.\n\nDesserts all sounded very traditional and delicious. Luckily, for us, they offer mini dessert samplers of any 6 desserts for $1.95. We tried the minis-Chocolate Zuccotto cake and creme brulee, wow~! absolutely delicious. Perfect crunch on top of brulee and the choc cake was rich-dense and moist at the same time!\n\nI loved the food, although, it's not mom-pop Italiano -and a little bit more pricey, it's not that bad. Remind yourself to make a reservation a week in advance because waiting around and smelling all the delicious pastas and antipastos will surely drive you crazy!\n\nCiao.", "date": "2010-01-19 17:25:12"}, {"_key": "1021059", "_id": "reviews/1021059", "_rev": "_fNyry1y--F", "review_id": "ditAYh1B9UIuMyQzeNx4bQ", "user_id": "sLgekUp1uedWpnDsztvkVw", "business_id": "Hradjug3SV4hYELH6HJK5A", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I love the Albrecht's discount store history  for it was the largest worldwide family owned supermarket  in the world.\n\nThe name was shortened from Albrecht to\"Aldi\" in German, this is one of the sister owned store chain started in the United States.

I am a little surprised by all the fabulous reviews, but maybe I caught them on an off night. I came here with my husband and some friends, for dessert. Right away, we noticed the awesome patio area they had. There was a movie (The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe) playing, a giant checkerboard, on the ground, many hula hoops and a plethora of chairs. I mean, as far as a patio goes, these people have an amazing set-up! It is so cute too! When it comes to their frozen yogurt, itself, that is where I had the issue. I just wanted some frozen yogurt with minimal toppings. I tried three different frozen yogurt machines, that were all out of yogurt, before, finally, the fourth one had a flavor I would eat. But it wasn't my first, second, or even third choice. That was a big disappointment to me. The topics were the same as every other frozen yogurt joint, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that; I just find most fro-yo places so very similar and this one went right along with that. One thing that was different was you could get a fro-yo with espresso, which my husband loves coffee and was all over this. It was $5.00 for the whole she-bang. It took the lady a while to make it and so she didn't charge us for the extra shots of espresso. I wasn't that satisfied with my frozen yogurt (which came out to $4.72 with a little fro-yo and some gummy bears), for obvious reasons, but I was very satisfied with the service! The man and the woman working the counter were wonderful. They helped our group of four and were patient with us, as we all took a while to decide what we wanted. I think maybe i just caught this place at the wrong time and would be more than willing to give them another try. As far as their service goes, they were extraordinary and that is something they deserve applause for.

Its two floors and the first one is regular tavern style with booths, lots of dark wood and mirrors everywhere. Then there is an upstairs bar and lounge that has plush lower level seats and some high up tables and stools and another bar, This is also how you get out to sit on the patio which is my FAVORITE! The patio is lush with greenery, they have hanging planters and planter boxes lining the fence. It is a truly awesome patio.\n\nFood:  The menu is decent with Veg options. We got the Lasagna Cupcake, (looks like a cupcake tastes like Lasagna) The Onion Soup (which they stressed was NOT French Onion soup but just onion soup, it still tasted great either way) and the pizza Margherita, (Nice large circles of melted Mozzarella on it). The food was good. Not great, but definitely on higher side of good. I love Neapolitan style pizza and it was a decent version, although I prefer Zavino if your looking for better pizza at the same price). Since I have been I havent repeated the cupcake, I have had the soup again and the pizza several times.\n\nDrinks: I have only had wine here, their Riesling to be exact. Its good and reasonably priced. They do have a happy hour with $5 wine and a special on Beer, but nothing special on their specialty cocktails, also their pizza is on sale during their happy too! A+++++\n\nService: Honestly it seems to be hit or mis, our first time is was great from the hostess greeting us to the server on the patio. The second time it was the bar tender and she was busy so not super attentive (understandable) My third time the patio waitress had checked out and apparently there is a rule after a certain hour you go the bartender for anything you need even if you are sitting on the patio. No body told us that and when I flagged a server down they were quite rude in letting me know that piece of information. My fourth time our server definitely sucked, he was un involved and super slow, after we finally got our check after 5 years of trying to flag him down the bill was wrong and we had to re flag him down.\n\nPrice: Standard Old City Prices, I would say most of the items are reasonably priced.\n\nOver all what do you want in a restaurant?

I liked how the broth wasn't oily - but then again, I'd take an oily flavorful broth over a broth with zero flavor.

Also, they have a burrito option and something with wonton chips if you don't want the rice bowl. It took a bit of time to make, but it came out warm, appealing, and utterly delicious.\n\nThe downside for me were that toppings weren't unlimited; I realized this only after filling in my order form. And on top of being fairly pricey for fast casual, there were a lot of premium toppings with upcharges. What would definitely increase my level of satisfaction is if they were a bit more generous for those of us ordering vegetarian; some fast casual places throw in freebies on top of tofu in their veggie bowls because tofu is cheap. Also, I wish they'd label their menu for dietary needs/allergies, and get their website running (online ordering would be great).\n\nHaving said that, I was very happy with what I ended up with. A colorful and nutritionally diverse bowl with not just the rice/greens and tofu, but mango, macadamia nuts, wasabi peas, fried lotus chips, and a half dozen other things. Their Thai spice marinade was fantastic; they had many options but it would take an exertion of will for me to try them instead of ordering that one again. So while I could see them doing some things to make me happier, I couldn't give them any worse of a review than this.", "date": "2018-01-03 02:39:49"}, {"_key": "1021363", "_id": "reviews/1021363", "_rev": "_fNyry2S--Y", "review_id": "kh_pVT0sHOYLTwUa1aHZhA", "user_id": "7WKPvLd8JYCC3n0In1JlHQ", "business_id": "jbJTF1zVmZsk4hea8hoeVA", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "5 stars all around!!

In the case of Bleu Sushi, Groupon did me dirty. I wanted to use the Groupon before the expiration date, and now I kind of wish I hadn't used it at all (and for me to say that is a big deal). \n\nI came here for a middle of the week dinner with a friend, both of us stoked for sushi - I love sushi but rarely eat it, so using this Groupon was a nice excuse to chow down on some sush. We were seated at a small table amid the crowded restaurant (boy, do they pack people in there) and proceeded to browse the menu (holding the menu, I accidentally elbowed the woman at the table next to me - that's how tightly we were packed). We started with the kimchee fries (based on numerous Yelp reviews), and as a lover of both kimchi and french fries I cannot understand why these are so highly recommended - the flavors do not mesh and it looks like a pile of sloppy mess. For the entrees we split the Sushi Bleu and the Yaki Soba noodles - neither dish was appetizing, and we actually ended up leaving three pieces of sushi and nearly half off the noodles behind because they were, in a word, terrible (noodles were too salty and the sushi had a rubbery texture that made me wonder how this would affect my GI tract). I must also note that at one point both of us ran out of water, and it took nearly 8 min (yes, I kept track) to get our glasses refilled. When we had 'finished' our food, the owner cleared our plates and didn't bother to ask how the food was or if we would like dessert. All around us (I counted five tables), the owner came over after the entrees were cleared and dropped off dessert on the house (which I had also read about on Yelp), but as soon as he saw my Groupon he shifted his eyes and brought us the bill (literally making us the only table around without dessert). After another wait to pay (can you sense I was pining to get out of there?), we were brought our change with nary a thank you from the owner.\n\nI swear by Yelp, and have read great reviews for this place (even for people using Groupon), but I must say that this was the worst dining experience I have ever had in Philadelphia, and I would certainly not recommend purchasing a Groupon or coming to dine here (but seriously, if you are going to eat here, at least buy the Groupon so that you are not paying full price).", "date": "2016-03-19 22:30:43"}, {"_key": "1021883", "_id": "reviews/1021883", "_rev": "_fNyry3O--Z", "review_id": "mkLhvbTx6_3pl6L6_g5j0A", "user_id": "HKZo5Fa0lNSjX9BbdOpjJQ", "business_id": "rAcK5XzHAZfPyqajxgjvcw", "stars": 4, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "After a few spotty lunches this fall (and one Monday when they were inexplicably closed), I'm glad to see that Jade is back on its game.

Although the hostess originally told us the wait would be 50 minutes, we ended up waiting about 20.

Has a little bit of melted cheese which was a nice touch.\n\n3) Shrimp salad/Mixed greens - I didn't order a salad, but no one at our table finished theirs.

We have a great week or so ahead of us.   A journey of culinary adventure that Reno has possibly never seen before.  And where do we lash the dogs to the sled?  Where do we embark on this epic sojourn?  A place called Provisions.  And provisions were provided in abundance.\n\nTahoe Blue had the entrance cocktail.   Just a little sip to get the appetite whet.  A light lemony concoction perfect to get things going.\n\nImmediately following that is Tournant giving up a proper honorific to Chef Paul Prudhomme in a tasty Alligator Etouffe.  This was a nice start.  Not to wild in the flavors but rich and balanced all at the same time.  If I wasn't excited with the soon to be open Feast....I am now!   The brains/brawn combo here isn't just a one two punch but a three, four or even more series of hits!  Loved the corn husk bowls!\n\nFrom there I think the intent was to head back to the Sliders being served from the Reno Provisions counter proper.  The sliders were just right and not too heavy.  I personally would have loved a stronger horseradish sauce, but that is just a personal preference.\n\nFurther into the depths of the store we found ourselves at the Czyz's demo kitchen where Blend was offering a skewer of pork belly and some sort of deep fried hummus.  The pork belly made me wish I could go to every event these guys ever cater.  Then I had the chickpea thing and I wanted to just book them right now for every meal of my life. \n\nI made my Uturn and returned to the front of Provisions.  My spot of drink was long gone...so I opened a tab for the House Barreled Negroni on tap.  During Happy Hour this is the best deal in town for a Negroni unless you come to my house.  The aging mellows the Negroni as many people know it...giving it a much more drinkable profile.  Totally worth trying this one or even the one at Campo if you haven't been a fan in the past.  \n\nAfter the bar I headed to my last stop...the table of Homage.  Oh My Homage!  That crab etc chowder was right.  And by right I mean it worked so well to finish the tour around the Provisions store Reno Bites Kickoff trip.  What?  There's more?  These desserts are for the guests too?!  Wow.  \n\nI can't say just how great this even was because I don't have the words to do it justice.  The samples here tonight were made by the \"Michael Jordan's\" of the Reno food scene.  Some of the hardest working and most talented that Reno has to offer.  \n\nSpeaking of hard work and oozing talent...I picked up that Yelp Passport to Reno Bites sometime between Negroni and Negroni.  ;)  Yelp of course had a great presence there, Michael T. always knows the best events to support and be involved in.\n\nFrom all of the food talent and great friends I was able to catch up with, the Kickoff turned out to be an event that fired on all cylinders for me.

It's been there since I was born.  Well, actually it's been there for a really long time before that, but the point is, I have memories of it from all of the major chunks of life I've experienced so far.\n\nI remember when my mom would bring my cousin and me to Storyland, and we loved how the little bridges and dips in the road in City Park would make our stomachs jump up into our chests when my mom drove over them.  Now that I think about it, it was probably so thrilling because New Orleans is so damn flat.\n\nI remember being in some art class when I was a kid, and we would go on field trips to City Park to draw stuff (mostly in and round the art museum).  I also remember going with my mom and my grandmother to see the Faberge eggs and the Degas stuff there.  It was one of the rare occasions when my mom and I tolerated my grandmother's presence.  It was a bonding experience.  \n\nWhen I was a Senior in high school in 1997/8, I went to City Park for Endfest and tripped my fucking face off while listening to the guy from Cowboy Mouth sing \"Why Can't We Be Friends\" and I almost lost my mind because I thought he was some kind of freaky mutant man who wanted to befriend me and I just wanted him to go away and that song went on for like 3 hours, and I think the only lyrics to it were \"Why can't we be friends? / Why can't we be friends? / Why can't WE be friends? / Why can't WEEEE be friends?\"  That's a bad memory.\n\nIn college, my friend worked at Storyland, and so we got to go to Celebration in the Oaks for free.  One year we decided it would be a good idea to drop acid and play Hide and Seek in the billions of lights after the park was closed.  I got stuck in a bush full of lights and then a security guard found us and kicked us out.  \n\nCity Park is an excellent place to walk your dog.  It's especially fun to take your dog and go onto one of the little islands in the big lagoon in the front of the park.  Then you can pretend it's your private island and if anyone tries to invade it, you will \"release the hounds.\"  It helps if you have two dogs, I guess, but I worked with what I had: one dog and a good imagination.\n\nVoodoo fest is here, and I am pretty sure there used to be ways to sneak in.  It's probably not even worth trying nowadays, though, because you can get in free just by waiting for someone who is leaving to give you their wristband.  I think it is difficult to be mean in City Park; you'd be surprised how many people are willing to be charitable after spending a day there.\n\nI sometimes (often) wish I lived in MidCity again so that I could go to City Park all the time like I used to.\n\nIf you go to Delgado, you might wanna leave your car in City Park while you go to class.  I'm not sure if this is a good idea, as I never tried it.  But I do know that when I was teaching there, a lot of people didn't bother buying a campus parking pass, and they just parked in the park.  If that's legit, then I imagine a short walk through the park on your way to class adds a lot to the whole college experience.  I mean, people pay megabucks to attend schools that have gorgeous old campuses.  Save your money and take a few classes at the Delgado City Park campus.  It sure beats UNO's industrial-park-looking swath of land (OK, so UNO built a lagoon.  Keep it up, UNO, and maybe your campus won't be so damn hideous in ten years).  Delgado's little lagoons used to be a retirement home for busted-up, one-legged ducks from the park.\n\nHolt Cemetery is right outside the park.  It's a pretty cool below-ground potter's field, and definitely worth checking out.\n\nA few years ago, I had a great big rooster named P. Clarence Manchild.  I had to bring him to City Park and set him free because the neighbors were threatening to kill him.  I hope he's OK, or at least that he had a pleasant run before being eaten by one of the wild hogs that roam the park.  I hear they stole some lady's lapdog.  They are brutal.  Are they still around?  I think they kind of took over the park after Katrina.\n\nCouturie Forest is awesome.  If you haven't been there since they renovated it (it got all jacked up in Katrina, and then well-intentioned clean-up crews made matters worse by clearing fallen trees willy-nilly, effectively encouraging the wrong species to take over, etc. etc.), then you should definitely go.  Stay off my swing, though.  \n\nIf you have a kid, you are obligated to bring it to City Park, make it sit on one of those oak tree branches that dip all the way down to the ground, and take several pictures of it.  If you don't do this, you are not a true New Orleanean, and neither is your kid.\n\nKeep in mind that City Park is pretty freaking important to the city.  It's the only \"nature\" some local kids have ever seen (or, sadly, will ever see).  So, if City Park asks for it, give them money.

I mean a four star rating is still above the average marks in Yelp land. But honestly, it feels like a drop much further (I contemplated three). I say all this when talking about the new Yards Brewery location.\n\nI may not be a Philadelphia native, but the last few years that I've visited the city of brotherly love, I've dabbled in some suds from this brewery's original spot. It turned into a favorite of mine and I was mostly excited to hear about their moving to a new, bigger, area. Coming with a few of my fellas last Sunday made us want to check out Yards' new digs, and unfortunately, I can't say I loved it.\n\nYeah, things were definitely larger. I like that Yards can house more people by adding long picnic-style tables (beer garden-esque) and high top booths, but all of that has become waiter service. Why? Yards has now added a potent food menu to their offerings. I know, you might be like \"Josh, what the hell is wrong with you? How can you not like this set up?\" Well, when you know what Yards used to be and what it is now, you might not like the change.\n\nI enjoyed that rugged, small town feel of the old place. I liked how things were set up with their beer and free tastes upon entry and pool table and rockin' brewery tours and all that jazz. It was a great set up that made you feel like you were in an historically Philadelphia-made craft brewery. Yards felt like the quintessential spot for brotherly love and it really, truly worked. But now, some of that feeling is lost.\n\nNo longer does it give off that small town vibe. Gone are the notes that Yards is a craft brewery of the city. There's a brewpub aspect taking the reigns and it's changed the dynamic of the place. You can sit at the bar, but that's all it is: a bar. Waiter service is great at a restaurant, but when a semi-pushy server keeps bugging you when all you want is one flight and a pint to share between yourself and three friends, it makes you wish for the setup of the past.\n\nBut I'm an optimist and I'm not going to drop Yards' ranking down to three...yet. Push away the parts that turned me off and they still are producing some of the best non-NY beer I've had. I love their founding father recipe styles. I love the fact that you can get almost all of their brews in bottles. I love...um, Chocolate Love Stout (totally saw that coming, didn't you?). None of that has changed. And maybe the food they're cookin' is amazing. Maybe when I come again at a different time, when I'm hungrier and thirstier and in need of a setup like what things are now, I'll be impressed....maybe.\n\nOverall, for now, I don't feel it. Yards gets the benefit of the doubt here for being a high quality brewery for what it crafts. Five stars still in my book. Beyond that, everything else seems of a three caliber. Average. I do look forward to my next time in Philly with hopes that my apprehensions diminish. Until then, I'll remember the way Yards used to be and think about the one thing that stayed the same: Beer.", "date": "2018-02-04 20:43:15"}, {"_key": "1023543", "_id": "reviews/1023543", "_rev": "_fNyry6W--Z", "review_id": "bc87VVlBRgtMwCWFdmefNg", "user_id": "Hxx8FmhpxiugIrGRh8RDOg", "business_id": "20-EyTyDc2-a30iDAQj64g", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "After all these years, we finally had a chance to visit the City Diner the other day for lunch.

I felt welcomed and that the staff was interested in giving good service. I've always loved the center at Broadway/Country Club and used to enjoy this particular building when it housed Elle. Sushi Garden was bustling and the outdoor seating was cool and inviting with plenty of misters going. The indoor decor was really nice, attractive and gave the place a cool vibe.\n\nI was part of a party of nine plus a toddler and our orders were taken very quickly after being seated and given an appropriate amount of time to review the menu. Plenty of food was ordered and everyone seemed pleased with the menu items. My selection included squid salad, tuna tataki and a burrito roll. The salad and tuna were good, not spectacular but good. I was very disappointed in the burrito roll. Spicy tuna, shrimp tempura and cream cheese rolled in a VERY sloppy rice roll with diced avocado on top. Any kind of spice in the jalapeno sauce was really non-existent. I was really hoping for a great burst of flavor but this roll left a lot to be desired. And honestly, there's nothing worse than a sloppily rolled sushi roll that falls apart all over your plate.\n\nOverall, the experience here tonight was good I just think there's better sushi to be had in Tucson.

We started off with the stuffed artichoke, which was cooked and stuffed to perfection. I chose the classic chicken Parmesan, which came with a house salad. This house salad wasn't just a skimpy salad of red onion and croutons. This salad was big and full of salami, cheese, and artichokes. I probably could have stopped eating there, but alas my chicken parm was on its way. OH. MY. GOD. The portions here are ginormous. For 15.00, that salad included, I could have wrapped this chicken Parmesan around my waist. It could have been easily split with my husband, who eats quite a bit.

Highly recommended.\n\nThe bread they gave us was delicious, though to be honest I was expecting pita. Instead of butter or just plain olive oil, there was oil infused with lemon and a swirl of pesto. It was great. \n\nWe shared the Greek salad with greens which was large enough to feed four people. Chunks of feta, cucumber, tomato, peppers. Yum. Next came the grilled octopus. I had never had octopus before! It was a little chewy but ultimately tasted like chicken. The vinaigrette that it was marinated in was to die for, and the perfect accompaniment to the heel of the bread. \n\nThese two dishes came out so fast (our server was very attentive) that we were afraid the scallops would be out in five minutes, and therefore scarfed down everything in front of us.

It was mostly sour cream guac and lettuce which was a bit of a let down. \nHowever this was made up for by the carnitas which still admittedly had too many chunks of fat per ratio of meat, but the meat that was there was delicious!! The beans and rice were great and those homemade tortillas were the best. Literally the best. \nThe horchata was good, not powdery/gritty like I e had at some places. Top all this off with a very nice salsa bar and I'd say we shall return!

No matter what you always get a fantastic meal!  \n\nMostly, I come for breakfast/brunch!\n\nHuevo's Rancheros is one of my favorite dishes and is usually my go to when I am here for a breakfast item.  I also like the barking Chihuahua when I am feeling very hungry!  Their frittatas are also excellent.  My favorite is the egg white turkey bacon frittata.  Its is a good option if you want a bit of a healthier type breakfast, with no loss of flavor! \n\nI like to come here with my sister and young nephew.  The place isn't bad for kids.  My nephew loves the pancakes and French toast. (He also loves their French fries!)\n\nTheir fruit is always super fresh too, which I love.\n\nFor lunch, I like to get either the Mel's Chicken cutlet (so drool worthy), the Tuscan chicken sandwich, or the Mediterranean wrap.  Everything is different and so flavorful.  Portions are pretty big, so whenever I come with my mom, we often share!\n\nTheir salads are also excellent.  Very often I will split a salad and sandwich with someone I am with, you cannot go wrong with any of the salads here.\n\nThey do themed brunches too, which is such a great novelty!  Special menu's are available for these with cute puns as all of the menu item names.\n\nThey don't serve dinner at all of their locations, but I highly suggest checking the places that do serve dinner out.  Fantastic meal!  Our go-to's are the octopus and calamari as a starter.  Always a good pick!  If we want something a bit lighter, we go for the hummus.\n\nThe dishes I have had as my main course are the Grilled Orange Ginger Pork Chop, The Honey Melon Glazed Salmon, and the Smokey Cajun Spiced Ahi Tuna.  You cannot go wrong with either.  Portions are also pretty big, so make sure you are hungry!!\n\n\nI also really like that this restaurant has plenty of vegentarian and vegan options.   I myself am a carnivore, but I do also enjoy the vegetarian options and have many vegan/vegetarian friends.   It is really nice to have plenty of choices and a variety in the menu which Sabrin'a certainly provides.\n\nThe prices here are pretty reasonable.  The only downside here, is the wait, especially on the weekends. Plus they can get crazy crowded and the space is pretty tight and can get pretty loud. However, I guess that is part of what makes Sabrina's so special.  Also, not a bad place for kids!Certainly worth a wait for the food, staff is always friendly and accommodating!  Great for smaller groups, but since space is on the tighter side, I wouldn't go in a group larger than 6.\n\nSabrina's is a great, casual, fun place to eat, I suggest you go and enjoy!", "date": "2015-07-31 13:36:03"}, {"_key": "1025711", "_id": "reviews/1025711", "_rev": "_fNyrz-a--L", "review_id": "5nXePkbsJN_-oy4KDIcioQ", "user_id": "9-z8DCVGGVhgwU-etc4zIA", "business_id": "aUoMG97DMJG4nmwhT6z1zA", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Devon has been one of my favorite restaurants since my first visit when graduating high school.

The affordable $45 per person pricetag pleased this veghead!\n\nI've been wanting to check out Tayst since I moved to Nashville a few years ago and now was the time. We made reservations with another couple to attend and were happy to make our way to the communal tables. The interior was certainly nice and almost cavernous. I sensed that most of the attention may have gone to operating as a \"Sustainable\" dining establishment instead of choosing to focus on tablecloths, interior design, and other aesthetically appealing areas. Don't get me wrong, Tayst has a clean and organized environment...just nothing memorable. \n\nTheir dedication to utilizing small local farms that grow without pesticides and fertilizers and offering up vegan options is more impressive to me than a fancy lighting arrangement. I also greatly appreciate that they minimize their waste through an internal recycling and composting system. From their \"Sustainable Pledge\" on their website, a focus on decreasing energy usage across the board to become carbon free is listed as a way to protect resources. Due to these steps, Tayst is certified as a Green Restaurant and have enjoyed significant press. I have to admit that I did get warm and fuzzy reading their pledge and viewing their media on their website. This has even inspired me to take more steps personally to make a difference.\n\nOkay. Fine Enough with the Oprah Aha Moments..on to the food:\n\nI can't speak highly enough regarding the Smoked Pumpkin Bisque which was beyond delicious. Another highlight was an almond dish that consisted of toasted almonds, almond froth, pesto, and pepper sauce. \nI am aware that this evening featured a tasting menu but I could have noshed on a trough full of this almond goodness. The Marinated + Grilled Tofu and also the Quinoa and Pea Cakes were good but the Cashew Cheese from the Dessert Sampler has been in my every dream since that fateful night. Dead serious. How do I get my hands on a massive supply of this stuff? It was paired nicely with the Port that was chosen to accompany the dish. \nNot to pretend that I am a wine aficionado...but I wasn't as impressed with 3 out of the 5 wines that were chosen for the evening. The first 2 white wine selections just seemed to have a very brassy flavor.\n\nWe all loved the casual and laid back vibe to the evening and the 4 of us even buddied up with a family that were seated at our table too.\nA pleasant ending to our evening included a visit to our table from owner/chef Jeremy Barlow. He candidly spoke to us about the environmentally friendly vision for Tayst and welcomed feedback. He also hinted that there are always veg-friendly options available to diners but due to the success of the Veganstravaganza 5 course dinners, Tayst will likely offer up even more.\n\nCan you tell that I just may be a Tayst groupie?", "date": "2010-10-15 18:12:35"}, {"_key": "1025794", "_id": "reviews/1025794", "_rev": "_fNyrz-i--Y", "review_id": "KSP9g_9BtRvHVj00MhCbFA", "user_id": "ikWD8meznb14w9yNie3bwQ", "business_id": "nz0bzLl6NX2_rETPFnf_dA", "stars": 4, "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "The Alley Cat Front Room is distinctively different from The Alley Cat Lounge we've grown to love over the years, despite what the signage above the beautiful new lounge exudes.  \n\nThe ambiance portrays class with several comfortable seating options that extend to the back, where door to the 'other side' of the business is located, through the kitchen, only accessible by employees.

I mean, I gave the W three stars and I'm sticking to it! It's just that I've stayed in all kinds of hotels pretty much my entire life, and I do mean those ranging from budget family joints like Days Inn to luxury hotels like the Hyatt, to smaller, cooler boutique hotels like Hotel on Rivington and now the Moonrise.\n\nI'll be honest with you, the amenities aren't quite as great as those at the W, and so normally I'd give the Moonrise a solid 3 stars (A-OK doesn't mean average in hotel stars, believe me). The Moonrise gets an extra star for the vintage moon photos that are just about everywhere in the hotel. I think decor-wise, Moonrise is my favorite, beating out even the Hotel On Rivingon's sleek rock and roll blood red/black decor! I just love the theme to death!!  There are the cute touches like the voice in the elevator making it seem like you're taking off/landing, the way that it always feels like nighttime is falling in the public parts of the hotel, the stationary, pens, all of it. LOVE.\n\nThat said, they don't replenish your products (H20, which I may like even more than Bliss' shower gel, shampoo and conditioner...Bliss wins for that facial wash, however), the way the W does. Oh well, not really a huge deal, and I guess I don't blame them. My room was spotless, extremely cozy and the bed was really luxe with loads of pillows. Temperature in the room was also perfect. \n\nThe gym was sufficient for a traveling morning workout. Three elliptical machines, three treadmills and three stationery bikes. The strengthening equipment left a bit more to be desired (no free weights and just one weight machine in the place that shares two sets of the same weights, so essentially only two people can work out on half the equipment at the same time). Again, not a big deal. I was thrilled by the lounge outside of it that allowed for working stations overlooking the main lobby. All so very well-appointed.\n\nCourtesy of the staff was adequate. I had an annoying check-in experience that I'm too weary to even talk about. Nothing major. Front desk staff was courteous (especially the gal working there in the evening). \n\nNot sure what was up with the cleaning staff. I had this one very eager dude wanting a greeting early in the morning and did not *get* that all I was able to utter was \"good morning.\" I hate being rude, but uh, it was early, I hadn't had much sleep and I just wanted to get to the effing gym. I stepped onto the elevator feeling guilty about not being more pleasant.  I really hope that guy wasn't cleaning my room. I do have issues with male housekeeping staff. The very idea of it just creeps me out, especially when traveling alone.\n\nNoise, well, I'll be honest, there was a morning when people were talking way too much in the hall (step to the elevator, please!) and there was a night that I just couldn't sleep due to the crowd spilling out into the street (apparently the lobby has that disco after hours thing going on that the W has) and what was more annoying was the asshole in the room next to me who banged on the wall to indicate that I was talking too loudly on Skype.

Great on the fly and for cheap!!", "date": "2013-03-01 18:49:52"}, {"_key": "1025905", "_id": "reviews/1025905", "_rev": "_fNyrz-u--a", "review_id": "k8NSQFveKym5AO9Ry-PRqQ", "user_id": "P29owxiU_OJTHpoMMnF7dg", "business_id": "j-qtdD55OLfSqfsWuQTDJg", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I know this place doesn't need my help but they deserve a great review. We had a wonderful experience at the Parc. The bread basket is AWESOME -- baguette, sourdough, and cranberry-raisin all were outstanding. My tuna carpaccio was killer. Daughter's half-chicken was generous and juicy. Bouillabaisse, pasta bolognese, deviled eggs, chocolate pot de creme -- not a single miss. Loved my Romarin cocktail too (elderflower, fennel, grapefruit) -- delicious!\n\nAn inadvertent fire alarm was handled well too! Kudos to the Parc!\n\nPS for fan's of Starr's bistro food, I heartily recommend his Le Diplomate in DC!", "date": "2017-12-31 23:22:16"}, {"_key": "1025921", "_id": "reviews/1025921", "_rev": "_fNyrz-y--H", "review_id": "vE4MCqyG7FJM1uYE9gLWzA", "user_id": "s8C7D6o_KI199rZYSFWjKw", "business_id": "KfIPQSLSj_rJ9zbsdO7wFQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "We loved it here. Outside of Winnie's leBus ( which I hate). Breakfast is hard to come by in Manayunk.  It's really cozy inside and very clean. Bathroom you could seriously eat in it.  My daughter had the chocolate chip pancakes, which she loved.  I had the breakfast sandwich which  was great. My husband had the Brekky bowl and LOVED it.  Greg the owner went out of his way to be sweet to my daughter.  Nice guy!!

The d\u00e9cor, the menu options and the beverages were all French inspired.  \n\nWe were roughly 15 minutes late because of traffic and they gladly held our reservation for us.  We were seated as soon as we walked in the door.  Our server was very friendly and greeted us immediately after we were seated. She seemed to be extremely busy because she was serving several other tables around us.   Within minutes my group had water and a generous serving of the most spectacular bread that I have ever eaten.  The service was very good, our server was efficient never leaving us wanting or needing anything.  \n\nOur appetizers consisted of oysters, steak tartare and shrimp cocktail.  All were more than ample portions and excellently prepared.  We had an array of entrees including beef bourguignon, Duck, roasted chicken with spinach and green beans for our shared sides.   My shrimp was fresh and tasty and the beef bourguignon and the beef was pull apart tender.  Absolutely delish!\n\nFor dessert, I chose the Bar Glacee which is a Flourless chocolate cake topped with ice cream and caramel peanuts.   It was magnificent and a real chocolate lover's dream. \n\nThe setting is opposite Rittenhouse Square is absolutely lovely, especially on a summer evening like last night.   The noise level is a little high, but as the night went on the level dropped.  \n\nI hope to visit again soon!", "date": "2017-08-11 13:17:00"}, {"_key": "1025947", "_id": "reviews/1025947", "_rev": "_fNyrz-y--h", "review_id": "H1EqIM6mVdripDtrfzIiQg", "user_id": "P9hbcVoZIPKF4gV8KH427A", "business_id": "t1KiSVmxADW1LaxA2Wtj9g", "stars": 5, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "text": "Came here for lunch w/ a co-worker today with not alot of expectations after reading the mixed reviews.\nWe arrived around 11:30 not crowds and our pick of tables.\nwe both opted for the soup and salad combo. i chose the shrimp bisque and buffalo shrimp salad. Both ere really great the bisque wasnt too spicy but was full of actual shrimp which i loved. The salad was a little small for what i though a small should be but really good after i picked off the cukes ( im not a fan) they are pretty generous w/ the amount of buffalo shrimp and they ask you to specify what type of hot sauce you prefer. The menu looks pretty goo and there a few options for veggie friendly eaters. the portions for sandwhiches were pretty huge enough for two meals for a small eater. \nIll def have to come back for another salad some other time \nat under 18.00 for both of us to eat lunch id say it was a good deal .", "date": "2011-08-03 17:17:32"}]
