I have been here many many times and as of yet i have not tried anything else other than the chicken fried steak, there are others who do it prettier, thicker, and crunchier but it is the closest you can come to something that grandma used to make in a cast iron skillet. It is a cube STEAK, a whole piece of meat that has been flattened out during the tenderizing process. It is breaded simply and then cooked on the flat top i assume, you can cut this dude with a fork, the gravy that comes with it is a perfect complement, it tastes very much like a gravy made right in the skillet with all the drippings and crispy goodness stirred right in. Something else that this place does well is the scone, this is a  SIDE that you can have like a piece of toast but it is huge and fluffy and...well, you need to try one of these, a bit of butter and powdered sugar makes it amazing.

Where to begin... :/ We ordered our food at 5:20pm. A larger group came in so the waitress recommended we get our Dutch babies (scones) with our meal so we didn't have to wait & we agreed that was a good idea. The waitress printed out our check at 6:47pm and we STILL hadn't gotten our Dutch babies. The large table next to us rec'd their's so I jokingly asked if those were supposed to be ours. At 7:37pm I texted my friend that recommended the place that we were STILL waiting. My sister paid with a gift card & the remaining balance should have been paid with cash. They did it vise versa (who does that? Now she has a few dollars left on a gift card). The waitress came to our table to say, \"Because it's taking so long, I've brought out lemon and butter in to-go containers.\" I was shocked, laughed and said... \"I thought for sure you were going to end your statement with, so we aren't going to charge you for them, but you didn't say that.\" Eventually, the owner was called in to reimburse us for the scones we never received because we were FINALLY told there was only 1 of 3 fryers working. When the owner arrived she was so mad she was shaking. She actually saw her employee slip and fall on the ground while we were talking and all she did was state her name in a super irritated way like \"get up!\" Can you say WORKERS COMP?!?! She reimbursed me for my meal after she was so frustrated trying to figure out to the penny how much she should give me back for my scone. When I said it would be good customer service to reimburse me for my full meal after all of this... She punched the buttons (mind you, she still shaking) and very rudely pushed the money at me and said \"Here, enjoy your free meal!\" All the customers were staring since she was making such a scene. She was so frustrated, I actually wanted to tell her to just take a deep breath and relax. (I'm the one that was in that place for 2.5hrs, I am the one that should've been angry). My little sister (who has 3 tiny little kids waiting patiently for their dessert that never came for 2.5hrs, before getting in the car for a 4hr car ride home AND she STILL TIPPED the waitress $5) paid with a debit card & the owner said she couldn't reimburse her for part of the meal on a credit or debit card \"So here, have another free meal!\" I told her that her incredible customer service would be on Yelp reviews tonight. I'm disappointed that I've heard amazing things about the scones (more like fair elephant ears than like a Starbucks scone) and now I will never be able to try one. I'd like to see the TV show \"The Prophet\" come in and rescue this tiny business that's been around since 1975 that apparently has \"the secret recipe\" for delicious scones. They need new ownership, a new location, new fry equipment, customer service training, more employees (those poor ladies were doing the best they could shorthanded) and safe working conditions.

Only 4 chairs, and the servers didn't even try to get a 5th chair. They finally left because of the lack of attention they got. Finally we got our order placed and the server recommended the chicken fried steak. It took 30 minutes to get our order. Remember..... only one cook. My wife ordered an omelet. Got our food finally. Chicken fried steak so greasy it made my stomach upset withing 15 minutes of trying to eat it. Gravy sucked, eggs over done, toast cold. My wife's meal was not much better. \n\nSo since this placed brags about their scones, we ordered one...... Waited another 20 minutes and never got it. Refills on drinks was a joke. I had to ask every time to get refills. Long story over with .....

So unless you are fluent in reading the language you will past this right by.  You might not even know to find this on Yelp because no where outside does it say Tang Palace.  Anyway on the corner of Olive and Grant, across from Luu Luu's.\n\nSo first time having hotpot at this place.  Each little sides was about $3, $4, or $5 depending on the item.  I had asked if we get refills on the item since the plates was quite small for what they charge.  The waiter's English was not so good and he kept saying yes you can order more.  So I  have a feeling it cost more if you need a top up.  Our meal cost us a little over $124 (4 adults and 3 small kids that did not really ate). We split this with our friends, but still pricey for Hotpot.  Would not be a bad price if the portions on the sides was better.  But sometimes you dine out because of the convenience of not cooking and cleaning and to give you the opportunity to enjoy your company.  \n\nThe veggie was fresh, the meat could be better because it was big frozen chunks. Sauce was delicious and the waiter help show me a traditional sauce that they eat with.  Now I had been eating hot pot since I was in my diapers and never had I seen sauces like these. Maybe it was because my family is a Vietnamese/Cantonese influence. But the sauces with the hot pot is the cherry on top.  They have a house special shrimp paste that is more like a spongy block. Sounds and looks odd but it was a crowd pleaser and super yummy. \n\nThe hot pot hit the spot for us. I would rate it a five star rating if the portion was bigger.  I think the portion would of been fine if I was just dinning with my spouse. But not for 4 adults.  Kids did not really ate to count them. All in all I would recommend this to another person who love hot pot or wants to try it.  It might be cheaper or more expensive depending on what sides you want to cook in the pot. We choose quite a few things. We were all extremely full and satisfied.  I would definitely come back for another leisure night or brunch.

Hubby is from New York so he can be very picky when it comes to pizza.  When we lived in Claymont we ordered from Sciarrino's all the time we loved there pizza but since we moved we haven't ordered from there because they don't deliver where we moved to plus it's out of the way for us to pick it up.  We have tried several local pizza places and we just haven't found a place that makes a really good pizza.  I'm sorry to say Mazzellas pizza was not any better.  I really had high hopes from all the good reviews and seeing the pictures plus the parking lot is always packed when we drive by but was disappointed when we finally ordered a pizza from here.  \n\nTo start with when I called they didn't have any pizza specials. When looking at their menu a large pizza is $12.50 and each extra topping is $1.75 so to get pepperoni and mushrooms the pizza would have been $17 when they have a combo pizza with six toppings for $19.  So I went with the combo I got extra pepperoni, extra mushroom, extra cheese and bacon to get the six toppings.  When hubby got home with the pizza the toppings were off the part of the pizza because there was way to much.  Trying to get a slice out was impossible because the center was so soggy everything just fell off.  By the time you got it on the plate it was a pile of pizza not a slice.  Had to eat it with a fork and knife.  It just wasn't a good pizza in appearance or taste we ended up throwing over half the pizza away. I know from looking at the pizza the sogginess was from the extra toppings but I couldn't see paying $17 for just two toppings.  I just can't justify paying $17 when I can go to Little Caesar's and get two deep dish pepperoni pizzas which aren't that bad for less then one pizza at Mazellas.

When we first landed in the Lou, the local restaurant and eatery scene was something that really stood out.  As transplants from a big east coast city and Missouri transplants who chose to live in the City, we were excited!  \n\nStacked is the real deal for big, plump, juicy and delicious burgers.  They offer something for everyone, from meat loving fanatics (they even have a mixed beef and pork patty) to  poultry devotees (there is a turkey burger, as well as chicken tenders on the kids menus) to vegetarians.\n\nThe atmosphere is great; a mishmash of tables, spacious and clean tables.  I loved the menu -  It was really more like a dossier, four pages in an old school office folder.  Loved it!\n\nThe kiddo had the grilled cheese (a gooey, cheesey dream on texas toast) with housemade chips, while the spouse and I did the make-your-own-burger option.  I opted for the ground chuck with cheddar and bacon on the brioche bun, and the spouse chose turkey with cheddar and caramelized onions and spicy mustard on brioche.  The burgers were excellent.  The soft brioche buns were toasted with butter to perfection. The patties were nice, thick and juicy.  And the toppings were perfect.  The burgers are served closed face, with lettuce and tomato on the side.  I liked that they kept the hot and cold components separately.\n\nAnd the sides!  With the make-your-own option, you get to pick among 6+ sides.  I chose the house cut fries, smothered with chili and cheese.  The chili was great!  It was made in house, not out of a can. And they used the same cheese served with their bavarian pretzels-  It makes a great combination with the fries and cheese.  The spouse chose the Parmesan and herb fries and they were consumed before i had a chance to grab a forkful.  The only negative was the house made chips were a bit stale.\n\nThe service was excellent!

I've had both the garlic fries and the Parmesan and herb fries as sides. Both were good, but I prefer the Parmesan and herb fries. The garlic fries didn't pack much of a punch - garlic flavoring is more subtle than I was hoping for. \n\nAlso tried the fried pickles and boneless buffalo wings.

I believe you can ask for tomato and pickles too but it didn't really need much more. The burger itself was very tasty indeed!!!! I always opt for sweet potato fries when available.

It is a hamburger with pepper jack cheese, jalapenos and a spicy sauce. It's hot, but not too hot! \n\nThe service on a couple visits has been exceptional! Very attentive very informative and very friendly. Awesome. \nThis last visit for some reason the wait for our appetizer was 45 minutes, for nachos, after we ordered .... And then another 30 minutes after that until we received our burgers. There was no apology or any reason why it took so long. There was a large group in the private room ... so possibly that could be the reason why.

Hours stated they stayed open until 1, so we thought we'd give them a try.  The place was near empty when we strolled in, but it was still inviting.  It was obvious we weren't there for the drinks when our waittress came over and said that the kitchen closed at 10.  Damn, we were like 5 minutes late.

He loved the concept and fully indulged.  We also ordered their regular fries and sweet potato fries.  The burgers were really good.  You could tell that they're made fresh.

Sometimes the sweet potato fries can taste too sweet, and that kind of ruins it for me.  Not these.  These were perfectly savory and crisp.  I couldn't stop eating them.

It's cooking/grilling 101... It's called salt and pepper....don't be afraid of it, it's your friend! Nothing is worse then as a customer I have to season your burger for you. If you don't properly season your meat, then it has no flavor and you are relying on your toppings only for flavor. \n\nSo far our best burger places we have found so far are 1.

And not to mention they introduced me to their home made spicy ketchup...let's just say, I feel it's a sin to consume regular ketchup after experiencing that. Then that first bite, it was unlike anything I've ever had in burger history. I couldn't believe what I had just tasted, the meat had a level of tenderness and texture I could feel was something extraordinary. The BBQ sauce was dripping off the thick cut slices of smoked bacon, with an unmatched regin of tangy delicious power. It was all converging together with the jalapenos adding a spice that danced off my taste Buds asking where, where did you get this incredible food? The bun was like 2 buttery golden pillows designed to house an empire of what was hands down the best burger I have ever had in my life.

There is a game room attached to it somewhere but we got so focused on the food we forgot to investigate. The eating area is open and loud-ish with tall ceilings and casual decor, like rustic hipster maybe. \n\nOur server was friendly, knowledgeable, and had advice to give if it was wanted. She listed off the special and the beer options. I went with a vanilla porter and the hubs got a wheat. Oh, and those with an aversion to craft beer - they do have Busch on tap and some other bottle options as well as a full bar. She checked on us often enough, our waters didn't go dry, and more beers were brought if wanted.\n\nWe both opted to BYO burgers and had fun doing it. Now for review and experience sake the hubs suggested I eat a \"real\" burger and I semi reluctantly went with that. He built a turkey burger on brioche with swiss, lettuce, tomato, pickle, red onion, and spicy beer mustard with fries stacked with \"fire\" (which is some sort of seasoning). I built a local grass fed beef burger medium well per servers suggestion that well would be too dry) with a pretzel bun, swiss, spinach, tomato, red onion, spicy beer mustard, Sauerkraut, and saut\u00e9ed mushrooms with house made chips. I didn't taste his but he said it was almost so good he couldn't tell it was a turkey burger - this coming from a dude that likes red meat but can't eat it due to an allergy, well, that's a pretty big deal. His fries were good but not my type of fries as they were hand cut but too skinny. However, they were good with the seasoning and I would recommend choosing a seasoning if you opt for fries. Mine was fantastic. Well done on the outside, medium on the inside, flavorful, juicy, and my choice of toppings suited me very well. I opted for housed made chips and they were ok. They were crunchy-ish and looked seasoned but tasted bland and had an aftertaste but I would give them another chance.\n\nWe will most def be back and I'll give the house made black bean patty a whirl.", "date": "2015-06-21 12:08:03"}, {"_key": "939882", "_id": "reviews/939882", "_rev": "_fNysb7m--R", "review_id": "S1kCizJ0_vJiUTBXGNhLhA", "user_id": "Cho8yl2rBzBytlt_kcLJYQ", "business_id": "BOjpe0u5u_cm9SWMS2KLFg", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This place was great!

All of us loved our meal! At an average of $10 per diner, Stacked STL can't be beat for delicious and freshly prepared food, excellent service, and casual/cool ambience in the Patch area of Carondelet. Sitting near the big windows allowed us to enjoy the neighborhood street traffic at this bustling intersection near the Ivory Theater - nice to see how vital this area has become. The menu here is burger heavy, and we ordered several different variations. The choices include not only beef, but pork, turkey, and veggie burgers for example. The chef has designed some very creative and exotic topping combos for the burgers, or you can dress them yourself. We loved them all, from build your own, to the smaller 5 oz burger, to the house specialties like the En Fuego (hot and spicy everything-pepper jack cheese, jalape\u00f1os, house-made spicy ketchup, chipotle mayo, etc). The brisket sandwich was melt in your mouth tender and topped with creamy cole slaw, which tempers the spiciness of the BBQ sauce nicely. The sides we tried also got rave reviews - thin cut French fries, sweet potato fries, slaw, homemade apple sauce. Little touches like serving the slaw and apple sauce in little glass jars to keep the liquid from running on the plate and soaking your sandwich bun is the kind of thoughtfulness I really appreciate. We tried several of the cane sugar soda options today, and enjoyed a nonalcoholic lunch, although a full bar is available. Service was super friendly and the right amount of attentiveness. Everything was served at the right temperature too - the hot dishes were piping hot, and burgers right off the fire for instance, while the cold items like the slaw actually retained their chill when presented along side the hot entree. I feel like you get a lot of bang for your buck here.

I know he was just scratching it but I just looked at him with my finger one knuckle deep as I requested a Tea with lemon. He figured out why I was doing it . I am not going to even assume that he went back and washed his hands afterwards, He was just not a good waiter. The other server (#2)  whom was working, was good. He constantly was taking care of all the tables including ours.  \n\nGlad I read the previous reviews before we went here. I had more patients for wait time and quality of service.  We were promptly greeted and seated.  \n\nThe good: the choices of burger toppings were amazing, I went beyond my comfort zone and had the celery slaw added to my grass fed burger. Both were delicious. The applesauce side was good. not great, too much Cinnamon. all the food was correctly cooked to our request.\n\nThe Average: sweet potato fries, bit thin for my taste, the sweet potato taste was not real strong. the Ice-tea was not bad. don't think it was fresh brewed. never received the lemon or asked for a refill. nor was the water refilled.\n\nThe Bad: One of the two waiters we had (#1). Besides the nose scratching, I watched him wander around, check his phone, and not really doing anything at all. We ended up getting better service from waiter #2 including getting the check brought to our table. The catchup bottle was 98% empty on our table and the one at the next table too.

The place is small and there really wasn't a good area inside to wait. The night we went was pretty cold and standing outside was not ideal, but since there wasn't a place inside I just sucked it up and stood outside until we could be seated. It seemed like the longest wait ever, but eventually the hostess came out and asked us if we wanted to be inside or out...ummm can't you see I am shivering out here? I don't want to sit outside! So she told us that it would still be a few minutes since they don't have anything available yet. Eventually we saw 2 people leave the bar and at the moment the hostess came out and asked us if we would sit at the bar-YES I will gladly sit at the bar to drink and eat as long as I can be inside where it is warm! \n\nWe sat down at the bar and there was 1 bartender working. Again, the place is small so having 2 may have been a terrible idea. My date and I noticed that she was \"in the weeds\" and so we didn't mind waiting a little extra before she greeted us. We could tell that she had to get a ton of drink orders out before helping us. No biggie. By the time she was able to greet us we already knew what we wanted to drink so it was a quick process. I asked for the \"create your own\" pad which she had in hand. While she went to get our drinks I selected my items for my burger. I ordered the turkey burger with swiss cheese and sweet potato fries. It was a simple combination. \n\nOur server/bartender brought over our drinks and took our orders. She was definitely busy! We each drank our drinks and just enjoyed the people watching. We even noticed that they have a pretty busy \"take-out\" section. There must have been 5 or 6 people who came in to pick up their orders (which the bartender was responsible for)! She had a lot going on. \n\nOur food came out and looked amazing! My burger was so juicy and the fries were crispy and flavored just right. I don't usually eat everything on my plate, but I was starving and ate every last bite-it was that good! \n\nOverall, the food is really good and the location is great for me. I would just like to see additional help at the bar if possible because the service wasn't as good as I would have liked. We had to flag her down a few times to order additional drinks. I also think it would be nice if they had room for people who were waiting for a table, it is just so crowded inside I don't know if this is even possible. Maybe with the warmer months it will be better since people can wait outside...but on cold nights and during the colder months this just isn't ideal. \n\nI can see myself going back, but maybe on a less busy and warmer night!", "date": "2016-05-20 15:26:40"}, {"_key": "946419", "_id": "reviews/946419", "_rev": "_fNyscHq--g", "review_id": "BT1e1zC9Y6hmEgNeaj5XwQ", "user_id": "VQro7KJpsspqEO68ilIJAw", "business_id": "BOjpe0u5u_cm9SWMS2KLFg", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Great food, drinks, and service!!

For those unfamilar with Spirulina it's a super food high in protein (vegan/gluten free), it contains beta carotene, vitamins, good things that make you big and strong. The sweetness from the fruit in this bowl masks the kale flavor so you don't even taste the kale. Great way to hide your veggies.

Any tomato-based soup needs to simmer for a long time for the flavors to blend.  This was overpoweringly tasting of canned tomatoes -- acrid, bitter, and pretty unpleasant. Oh, and so, so, so salty.   I'm not one to send food back, so I added a pack of white sugar to my bowl and stirred and stirred until it was palatable.  That really cut the edge of the bitterness off.  \n\nI also got a loaded baked potato, which was excellent, and my daughter had half of a turkey bacon melt, which she loved.  \n\nThe restaurant has plenty of parking and was clean (restrooms, too) and well-staffed.

No biggie except that we only learned about this after the endless wait when we overheard our dipstick server tell another table. I'm convinced that the poor experience was due solely to the server we had - she was awful. My grandpa-in-law ordered a water and got a coffee. He ordered the pick 2 (soup and salad) with a baked potato on the side and got his meal sans the tater. When he said he'd ordered it her defense for not bothering to write it down was that it was a pick 2 and the potato wasn't included...

It's a pick 2, not a pick 3\") almost made my head spin. She was rude, disrespectful, and sloppy. She didn't even send a manager to the table to resolve the situation. She disappeared for a time and came back saying the manager was busy, but we could complain on our way out if we wanted. I won't even mention the ice I kept slurping hoping she would bring the refills I requested. Okay, maybe I will. Long story short, we complained on our way out the door (after my ninja-like father-in-law had already paid the bill) and received an apology from the cashier (who may or may not have been a manager) and received a few $2 off coupons for our next visit. I don't think Bob would have been happy. The only reason I'll go back there again in the future is because this was one snafu in a list of many pleasant visits.

I used to be neighbors to one of the original servers at the Broadway location, and she told me stories about the owner's kindness, as well as incredible tales of his efforts to be a bridge between families torn by the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea.

A friend and myself went in around 10:30 pm on Friday night because we were craving waffles. I want to start with this- this place is a dive. It smells funny when you walk in, everything is sticky, and it's decorated like that trashy great aunt's house you had to visit as a kid and she just never seemed to give up on the Nixon era. Our booth didn't have cushioning and there were flies everywhere.\n\nThat being said, it's kind of part of the appeal? If you're into that sort of thing. If you're expecting a clean, totally sanitary, updated eatery don't go here. \n\nMy biggest problem was that the prices didn't reflect the atmosphere. Usually dives price according to their appearance, the grosser the place, the cheaper the food. I got the pecan Belgian waffle with a small milk and one slice of bacon and one sausage link and my total was $15. (They automatically add a tip between 10 pm and 7 am or for parties of 5 or more, be warned- I almost didn't notice. They also add a 10 percent tip on all to-go orders as well). \n\nThe waffle was amazing and had tons of pecans in it, which was great. The bacon was crispy with little to no fat on it. The syrup is served warmed and they bring you a whole little jug so you don't have to worry about messy packets. I had to take home leftovers. \n\nI thought the service was really good- the server was very personable and fairly attentive. Our order was correct and there were no issues with the food or the service. \n\nI also used the free WiFi and it was good- no connectivity issues. Parking was also good- they have a large lot with plenty of spaces. \n\nWhen we were leaving around 11:30 it started to get crowded - I think it was homecoming and high schoolers were looking to hang out after the dance. When you're leaving, you take your order ticket to the front where the cashier rings you out. You have the option to leave additional tip, which we did, at this time.\n\nAlso- note- it is now 24/7. They no longer close on Sundays, so that's awesome. One of the few late-night places in South City. \n\nOverall, I would go back. The food was good and the atmosphere was very low-key and divey.

I have pretty high standards when it comes to breakfast; there are two restaurants total which have knocked off my proverbial socks, and I wasn't confident that this was going to be one of them. \n\nThere was a small wait for a table on Sunday morning, giving us a little time to glance around the rather odd decor, which made me feel a bit like I was transported back to the 1970s. Once seated at our table we were presented with menus with a LOT of options, all reasonably priced. It didn't take me long, however, to reach my decision. I was there for pancakes of course!\n\nI choose a western egg white omelet, with a side of pecan pancakes. My partner chose an dish called 2x2x2x2, which came with eggs, pancakes, bacon and sausage.  The service was decent in taking our order in a timely manner and delivering it fairly quickly.\n\nMy breakfast companion was pleased with his standard American breakfast fare. The bacon was to his liking and the eggs nice and fluffy. He was a tad disappointed in the pancakes, which were a little too done for his taste. \n\nAs far as my dish goes - it was the best omelet and the best pecan pancakes I've ever had. A nice light omelet with ham, onion and peppers, with melted cheese (perhaps Velveeta?) creating a cohesive little bite of heaven with every forkful. The pancakes, topped with butter and sugar free syrup, were light, fluffy and stuffed with just the right amount of crunchy pecans. \n\nPair it all with a decent cup of coffee and I definitely had the most deliciously satisfying breakfast I've had in awhile. \n\n100% recommend stopping by Uncle Bill's, any time of the day or night!", "date": "2015-07-08 16:51:51"}, {"_key": "1047242", "_id": "reviews/1047242", "_rev": "_fNyrzsW--A", "review_id": "7B5itZW0kIj7Vmq_pBzPow", "user_id": "Sy14dEhdIgznm5axvmQh5w", "business_id": "lQ58_4SzdETRSw0h8tilhA", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I got the young spring chicken but the name is a little scary.

I get that it's a popular old joint. But it had a smell and many eyesores. \n\nOur server was so so. Cant remember her name. But she wasnt super friendly like I would expect at this sort of place...\n\nThe food is what saved it! I got the 2x2x2x2 supreme. 2 eggs, two sausage links, 2 bacon slices, 2 pancakes and hasbrowns! Pancakes and sausage were my favorites! I also got the \"large\" grapefruit juice. It was a very small for a large. Oh well. Hubster got eggs, sausage, and hasbrowns. It came with your choice of like 2 biscuits, 3 pancakes or toast (they dont mess around with portions!)  He got biscuits and added sausage gravy. The gravy is one of the best we have tasted in a long time! The bill came to about 40 bucks with tip. A bit pricy for diner quality food but it was at least delicious!\n\nWe wont go out of our way to go back but would probably stop in if we were in the area.", "date": "2016-07-02 20:00:05"}, {"_key": "1155724", "_id": "reviews/1155724", "_rev": "_fNyr34S--Y", "review_id": "A19NMKZQv2bWTAb9zyez_Q", "user_id": "RxXAfhM46JXrR73_hZy0ng", "business_id": "lQ58_4SzdETRSw0h8tilhA", "stars": 1, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Way overpriced for the quality of food and service.

Well, most of the food I would be able to pass over... but as far as breakfast foods go, I need more greasy diner food in my life.  I have been on the bad side of \"You have never been to Uncle Bills?\" for a few years now.  I guess now that I have been, I can turn around and use this on other people.\n\nUnfortunately my first visit was not one where I was completely drunk... because I understand in general that is the time to go.  But here's hoping for next time.  This time was just breakfast.  It was the best option for a Saturday morning after a long Friday night out.  \n\nThere was a bit of a wait when we walked in the door, which I assumed was normal, but I didn't really understand the line part.  Everyone waits in a line that is marked off by a little barrier to separate the entrance and the exit areas.  I can't tell if there is usually a line, and the line was not very long, but it was there.  We waited about ten minutes for a table.  This was totally reasonable.  But then it seemed like we were waiting at the table for quite a while before a waitress came over.  Or really before anyone brought coffee, which is a critical play in a situation like this.\n\nAs for ordering, the name of the place has the word \"pancake\" in it, so that is what I went for.  I was between blueberry and buckwheat, which I think is a generally overlooked and underrated pancake choice.  I went with the buckwheat, and it was a good choice.  The blueberry got knocked off the list because of the compote, which means probably no blueberries in the pancakes, but maybe a solid try for next time.  My breakfast eating counterpart got the pecan, which I will admit here, but never to his face, that I was pretty jealous of when they came out because they smelled absolutely amazing.  Also on the short list of choices for next time.  \n\nOnce the coffee started coming, the staff kept the cups pretty full, which is good because the only thing that knocks down my reviews of breakfast places more than an empty coffee cup is nothing.  Full, in fact, I like it when they have a roaming robot with a carafe filling the cups.  Ok, that has never happened, but it is a solid idea.  The staff here was as remarkably close to those robots as I have ever seen, and I loved it.  \n\nAs for asthetics, you can't really get better than wood paneling and carpet that looks like it has been there since 1961 when the place opened.  The big question that I have is: Is there just this one carpet company that is supplying old timey restaurants with new carpet to make it look like the carpet has never been changed?  Because even if you are open for 24 hours/7 days, for 50 years, that carpet has been changed at least every ten years.  I need the number for this carpet company.  The panelling I am certain is original.\n\nNow that I have been, I am pretty sure I am going to have to go back.  I love breakfast.  I am going to have to walk my way through most of the breakfast menu.

The restaurant was still very full and the tables are cramped very close together. Keeping the closeness in mind, you may want to keep that in mind when picking your subject of conversation.

Also, being placed next to a couple of small children at 11PM is not cool either. They were cranky and noisy -- just not what we were wanting to hear all throughout our meal.

Recently I asked for gravy on my biscuits and didn't get it, but they were good about taking the gravy off the bill. Everything is delicious -- like mom makes. If you're looking for a variety of options to go with your typical bacon and eggs look no further. Our personal favorite is the \"juicy burger\" with two eggs. It comes with hashbrowns and your choice of biscuits, toast or pancakes. I usually get biscuits and add gravy. Delicious and totally hits the spot if you're looking for good breakfast food.

Excuse you, white lady who was hosting that night, there were only five of us, not that difficult. Just put two tables together. However, this woman says, \"I'm gonna have to go to the back... brb\" and goes to the back, making us wait for 12 minutes (yes, I timed you) then talked to a waiter (who was helping her solve this rocket science equation) saying, \"yeah, it seems we have no choice but to put it together.\" And with her oh so genius partner they connect two tables together and sat us down. \n\nWas that so hard? Well golly! Slap my redneck ass and drink a jug of moonshine because that was oh so difficult for you people to figure out! \n\nSo we sit there, waiting for a waiter to come take our order and it takes us 15 minutes. Um, those who are fans of City Diner will probably say, \"bitch please, this place is packed with people.\" Um, matter of fact no, it wasn't packed at all. There were only 4 other tables who already had their food and were about done. So after our good old 15 minutes of twiddling our thumbs, we get this waiter who gets our order and it takes a good amount of time for it to come out. \n\nHowever, the food was nothing to be special about. I ordered the turkey club sandwich and though it was pretty big (no complaints) it wasn't that good (complaint). My friend ordered chilli with some fries - which I think the fries were good but not so much of the chilli. Also another friend got a simple cheeseburger and it didn't look that great. The milkshakes just looked like icecream too - like they were too lazy to make it into an actual shake and just gave it to us to make it. Also when we split the check, the waiter had such a hard time. He even told us, \"It will take about 20 minutes.\" \n\n20 minutes. \n\nWow, ok genius. Go ahead and take your sweet ass time. \n\nSo what good came out of this... hmm, it would have to be the french fries and the whole scenery of people rushing into the Fox Theater (which I love).

My plate arrived shortly after, with regular (not banana pecan) pancakes. I brought it to the attention of the server, and she promptly replaced them as well, at least leaving us the original pancakes. She was also not attentive, and didn't check on us throughout the service. I often had to call for her as she passed us to get her attention for drink refills, or requests for silverware.\n\nOverall, food was great. \nI don't know if the cooks generally mess up orders, or if ours were put in wrong, but that aspect definitely left something to be desired.", "date": "2011-03-28 16:48:58"}, {"_key": "1060475", "_id": "reviews/1060475", "_rev": "_fNyr0H6--J", "review_id": "HyBWEFCqWIqJzyyTJJ7X0A", "user_id": "WYbTwHO80v0ODqBpNO4hzA", "business_id": "niYgIO2ZMUX7CVvr1B5McQ", "stars": 2, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "A cheeseburger for her that was way overcooked, and a mid-day slinger for me that was not good.

We stood by the hostess stand for 10 minutes while a few frazzled employees kept running by without even a small acknowledgment. We tried to get a few peoples attention but the most we got was a stare by a waitress and then she went on with what she was doing. Finally a couple who was walking out told us they had been sitting at the bar so there was now 2 seats available there. Perfect. We sat down at the very small bar and I cleaned up all of the empty plates/drink glasses from the previous customers. The bartender saw us, smiled but then walked away. Um. Ok. He disappeared for 5 minutes and came back with waters for another party at the end of the bar. I tried to flag him down so I could at least get a water and put in some type of order but I was completely ignored. I understand being busy, I have worked in a lot of customer service rolls in my life but would it kill them to let us know \"We are really busy but I will be right with you.\" I don't know, something that says hey we see you, we appreciate you are here and will get with you asap. I think that is not much to ask for. So after another 10 minutes we left.

They looked over and never signaled to us. Finally, one said to wait just a minute. Then he proceeded to take a few orders, fill drinks, and run a tab. A waitress then said she'd be with us. Then she got some wine, water, and beers for 3 different tables. She brought food to 2 tables and stopped to chat with someone in the back. She finally came over to us and said they were short staffed that night. We were standing at the entryway for 15 minutes, arms full of bags and kids, with an empty 4 top right in front of us. The first waiter then said we would have to wait a while, and when we asked about the empty table, he said it needed to be cleaned. We waited again. The waitress put our menus down on the dirty table, then the waiter made us lift them up so he could spray the table.\n\nWe sat and waited--no water, no drink orders.

Dirty dogs has great combinations, ample toppings, and still allows me to eat my hot dog like a civilized human being eating a hot dog outside a Home Depot.\n\nThey have like 20 sauces (i.e., mustards, ketchups, and hot sauces) you can top your hot dog with, I really ever go for like the same 4, and sometimes you don't want any of the sauces cuz it'll mess with your existing toppings. Plus the sauces look a bit old. But what really makes this place is their super soft buns, o geez... Anyways, I've had the chilli dog (amazing), the jalapeno and cream cheese dog (surprisingly amazing), and the St Louis (provel and pizza sauce) dog (not surprisingly bad). The gf always gets the Chicago dog and loves it, craves it dare I say.\n\nFew other things to note, if it's winter time (which today was), there's not always a warm place to eat. Sometimes they have a bench inside (today they did not). If it's warm enough though, they usually have a picnic table outside. \n\nDecor, it's home depot-y.

From the look of the place, it seemed like it must be new and is still improving the decor.  A large notice on the front window (I assume they are awaiting a license for drinks) made me think they were closed initially, but they do have a neon sign saying when they are open.  So, I went on in and grabbed a seat.  \n\nI was greeted promptly and given a menu.  I explained that it was my first time here and could use help picking something from the Honduran/Dominican menu.  The host was very helpful and explained that they have a list of foods from both nationalities as well as more Americanized items like Cuban Sandwiches.  \n\nWith his help, I went with the Pollo Guizado with moro and salad.  The Pollo Guizado is described as Chicken Stew.  The moro is a traditional rice and bean side dish that took on an orange color from the seasonings.  \n\nWhen the meal came out, the chicken and rice/beans were mixed together.  The chicken stew did not come with a broth, so it was more like a slow roasted dish.  Please note that to enhance the savoriness of the flavor, they use the back bone/neck of the chicken in the roasting.  So, watch out for small vertebra and cartilage pieces before chomping.  I assume the hoofed proteins don't have to carry this caution.\n\nThe flavors of both dishes (since I ate them together on each bite) were deep and savory without being overwhelming.  The heat level was low (intentionally).  The host mentioned that certain items can be made \"hotter\" with additional spices (such as the stir fry items), but that they want to appeal to more palates with their basic recipes.  \n\nThe portion size was reasonable and quite generous for lunch.  \n\nThe salad was a nice side salad size with crisp lettuce and red cabbage.  The dressing was already on the salad when served.  Fortunately, there was a correct amount of dressing to add flavor without making the salad drenched.\n\nI also tried a Guava natural juice with lunch.  It had a bright sweet/sour flavor with a bit of tangy kick.  \n\nOverall, I enjoyed my experience.  I think it could use a bit more decor work to make it more visually appealing.  The customer service was polite and generally good, but could pick up a few pointers like offering glasses of water to the customer and bringing out the silverware/napkins ahead of time.  Little things to make the experience more appealing.\n\nI definitely preferred this dining experience to my first Honduran meal at a north side restaurant.\n\nReview #160", "date": "2016-10-17 20:46:36"}, {"_key": "1016971", "_id": "reviews/1016971", "_rev": "_fNyrysG--R", "review_id": "D3B1KIxr63pRqANvlBdU5w", "user_id": "8pa6Nr64iPYALBbMM6hWfg", "business_id": "Bn0RQdRU9hDpKVJT6f7OXA", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Incredibly fresh and authentic foods.\nHad the mofongo w/ steak.

First, let me start off my saying if you are expecting ambiance or anything fancy, this isn't the place to go. Also, if you check menus online before going to a restaurant, save yourself the heartbreak with this one. \n\nWe were seated immediately and asked for our drink orders. After ordering a water, the waitress informed me that they were out of ice and out of plantains, two important staples in a Dominican restaurant. (Strike One) \n\nWhen the waitress returned and I ordered the pollo Guisado (stewed chicken), the waitress hesitated as if she was unsure if they had that in the kitchen. After jokingly laughing and saying, \"don't tell me you don't have chicken either!?\" She ran back to the kitchen and confirmed they did in fact have chicken. (Strike 1.5) \n\nThe food comes out, and looks delish! (Ok, I'll take back a half a strike!) but then the waitress disappears for about ten minutes without giving us napkins, forks or knives. (Back to 1.5 Strikes) there also was no salt or pepper on the table. \n\nFinally dig into the food. The flavor was delicious. The meat was tender and flavorful and the rice and beans was the perfect compliment. Even despite not having the staple plantains it really was a delicious meal! \n\nOverall, If you want good food and are willing to sacrifice for terrible customer service, this is your place. I would normally rate this experience at a 3, but I've taken one star off for the waitress, who made several comments in regards to not having items - \"I just work here, hunny!\" I plan to spend my money at places who at the very least take responsibility for not delivering on the products outlined in their menu.

Splenda lemonade aside, I love this Chick-Fil-A and I, like most I'm sure, wish they were open for chicken giving every day of the week.", "date": "2010-12-14 17:37:16"}, {"_key": "1211133", "_id": "reviews/1211133", "_rev": "_fNyr50u--K", "review_id": "Ht5WtOFxLRfBbZGev0CkZw", "user_id": "fHGDr6bIDmMT13ShkaY62Q", "business_id": "jcnKA1gG7Tek_UT2zWBI6w", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "If I am going to eat fast food I always opt for Chick-Fil-A.

When we arrived we, total of 6 people including a 3 yo, were sat a large circular table. Since my family had never been before they wanted to take their time to look over the menu, especially my mother who is on a relatively strict diet, and the waitress took our drink order and it came out promptly. This was the calm before the storm.. The drinks came out and our order was taken. Then we sat looking at each other for what felt like 40+ minutes with most of having empty glasses. This would not have been a problem and understandable if it had been busy but there was 5-6 tables of guest with us being the largest group and as we continued to wait we noticed the wait staff, including a lady who seemed to be the manager on duty,  gathering in a booth, of about 7-8 people, talking, laying down, on their phones, and etc. Our waitress was not to be found until 5 minutes before our food came out to let us know that it would be a few minutes longer and brought us more drinks. Our food then came out and as usual I was happy with my food, small boneless wings half honey mustard half Parmesan garlic, but my family wasn't so impressed. Let it be known that we did not order much food either for it being 6 people 2 sets of snack sized boneless wings, one small order of boneless, a plain grilled chicken salad, grilled buffalo chicken sandwich, one order of potato wedges and one of fries, chicken strips and 2 apps. of fried pickles. Most of the food ended up being over cooked/dry or sloppily put together. Now, 6 hours later I feel like I have acute food poisoning. I have worked in restaurants and know that unless we were slammed that amount of food should not have taken that long. All in all, I was extremely disappointed in this particular wild wings and believe they need a surprise inspection from corporate and maybe the health department. Very unprofessional, too long of a wait, and food was mediocre at best. I would have been better off going to McDonalds and at least saved a little money and would understand why I feel sick.
