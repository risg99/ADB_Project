Personally, I don't care much for socializing at the gym.  Everyone was very good about respecting my privacy, but I also got the impression that it was a very warm and friendly environment.  I like this over the aggressive tones that I sometimes get from other gyms (maybe I'm paranoid).  In the fall of 2013, Boost announced a move and MASSIVE facility upgrade.  I saw the plans and new that this was going to be very nice.  I immediately renewed my contract for the next 2 years to lock in my rate.  I moved to the new facility and have been enjoying watching everything come together as I work out.\n\nSadly, I was informed in early March 2014 that my job would be sending me out of town for the next 10-12 months.  I remembered checking out the Boost reviews and DREADED trying to close my contract.  Technically, I am not changing addresses (I'll be living out of hotels) and I know that it is not permanent.  I read the agreement and I did not feel like I had good argument other than it was a special situation.  I started the cancellation process online and tried to make sure that my situation was understood. I wanted to make sure that I was polite and understanding in the fairness of the situation for both parties.\n\nThe GOOD:  Joey and Jon took great care of me.  As soon as I got them all of the facts and had a face-to-face, the problem was solved.  I am not happy to be leaving MY GYM, but I am happy that they made the situation much easier.\n\nThe BAD:  It was a bit difficult to get ahold of Joey to start (I did not start by putting in my 30day online notice).  Obviously, it was during their huge renovation AND during the spring membership/renewal rush.  The day that I had my face-to-face, I watched him take back-to-back appointments for a good 90 minutes during my workout before I approached him. It is a small business going through a busy time, no big deal.\n\nConclusion:  This place is great and the other reviews support that (unless you plan on dropping your contract).  I feel like I would have been writing a very different review if I hadn't been polite.  I had a contract with Boost that I had to break.  I pleaded my case and asked for understanding.  Because of that, I am leaving on good terms and can't wait to tour the finished facility when I come back!", "date": "2014-03-29 01:13:56"}, {"_key": "978132", "_id": "reviews/978132", "_rev": "_fNysdDG--S", "review_id": "qeuNfUSKmIzTKU_zYWhp2w", "user_id": "acsgklztOz0MzucAeiTcuw", "business_id": "VeQDoCQmur6VG8TMvyzYUQ", "stars": 4, "useful": 4, "funny": 2, "cool": 3, "text": "I absolutely love this gym.  The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and a true joy to work with & be around (from the initial tour, to billing, to everyday questions, you name it.)  They offer a wide array of group classes with fun instructors, to which none of the classes are ever 100% full, which I love because I get my own space and don't feel \"stared at.\"  The cardio area is large with a nice selection of equipment; I've never had to wait on a machine either, which is a huge plus for me.  I'm not one to really socialize while working out unless I specifically come with someone to workout with... that said, on the floor, everyone really respects the space of those around them but doesn't make the environment feel cold or unwelcoming.\n\nI absolutely love how on Monday evenings and Saturday mornings a local farmers market sets up in the lobby with luscious greens, farm fresh eggs and fresh seasonal fruit/veggies.  Talk about encouragement and a friendly reminder to be healthy from within, too!  They also have a health-conscious chef delivering homemade soups, fresh juices and other meals in their cafe to take with you (which comes in handy those nights I'm working out late or I'm on the go with no time to cook.)  I have to give them huge props in this area on standing out as their own entity in the vicinity.\n\nOverall, the environment is great, the facility is clean and I would highly recommend this gym over any other one in our area.  My only suggestion to the club would be for the child care: to segregate the children by age groups (i.e. separating the older children from the younger toddlers/babies.)

It's got 3 pools, indoor and outdoor bball courts, a subway onsite, and of course weights and cardio galore.  The coolest thing about the Y in my opinion is their weight machines.  A Y trainer will sit down with you, create a workout with the machines, and you can track your progress electronically.  It tells you what weight and spec you should be setting the machine, how much you've lifted, how many times you've lifted, etc...  And it's all included in the basic membership.\n\nThey also have classes such as BOSU, spinning,  Zumba, pilates, yoga, etc...

I meet a guy working out there, who was there when 15 cop cars and the fire department was fishing her body out of the lake, so yeah, not feeling the park anymore. \n\nI like this location in some ways better than the other because first it is TRULY 24 hours. I think this gym is an excellent gym, and offers an in-door hot tub, that is probably 102 to 103, so yeah I could go hotter, but solid enough to appeal to everyone. I don't know why there are so many low reviews, not sure what it used to be, but I find the staff, very nice and helpful. Actually I find that at both locations, I am in the service business, and you know when someone cares, and someone is passing the time, and always seen the former and not the latter. \n\nOther things I like about this gym is this climbing gizmo, it's the hardest cardio and muscle thing I have ever done, so far I think I am up to 200 feet, not sure how to read the numbers, but it's EXHAUSTING both muscles and wind, so I LIKEY! \n\nAll the equipment is in order, and they have MANY machines, although a couple of the tread mills making noise, probably need an adjustment or something. My only reason for the 4 stars is some of the equipment isn't as primed as it could be, display might be off a bit, the seat on the bicycle is hard to adjust, not big deal stuff, but after training at the other location you notice small stuff. My biggest 4 star reason though is having to change the channel on the TV from downstairs, when you are training upstairs. \n\nI frequently have been doing the TV thing at 24 Hour, it gets my mind off sweating, breathing, and thinking all those dumb thoughts you get about how you need to stop, it burns, I need to quit, etc. It keeps my mind on my goal, whether it's a mile, 1/2 mile, a time commitment, etc. that I create when I get on a machine. The TV keeps my mind from dwelling on things I would rather not think about, so yeah, it's kind of important to me, and it's not convenient to go downstairs stick a remote upwards, change the channel, then go back upstairs to train.

Weeks went by and they weren't fixed. Winter came and I think that they still haven't fixed them but I'm not sure. The new manager (Gerrell) came on board and decided to start changing \"the rules\". My trainer and I use the large medicine balls and slam them. That's what they are made for. The manager decided that we shouldn't do this on the gym floor and that this should be done in the small functional training/stretching room in the back. Seriously!? There are people back there foam rolling, etc. and we're slamming a ball right next to their head? Strike one against Gerrell. Next (a few days later), I go into the gym and the entire gym is out of toilet paper! Not for one day, but two days in a row! That should be a health violation! Strike two.

He watched us do these the other day and then yesterday I came in to work out and both of these benches had been bolted to the floor! When I went to question it, he said that we shouldn't be using the bench for that! Really!??

The Zumba classes at both North and South are loads of fun - I really like the instructors.  Aida is full of energy and enthusiasm.  Keeps you going and burning lots of calories.  Emma works you and you know you've gotten a good workout after having a class with her.  Elvia gives you a real \"feel good\" feeling after taking Zumba with her.\nStaff are always friendly at North and South and greet you and always tell you to have a nice day when leaving.  The gyms are always pretty full with people using the weights.  Bathrooms and showers are clean.  24 hour South has a pool and both places have jacuzzis.

I believe the instructors really make the classes and are responsible for members to keep coming back to the classes.  Zumba is my favorite class.

I feel as if their programs aren't specialized for that person, which is not what I would want from a program/trainer.

There is even a caf\u00e9 here. There is also a very updated section of the gym with advanced machines (\"Technofit\"). These machines store all your workout info on the cloud when you put your key in or sign into the cloud through their app. The women's locker room is also very clean and includes a sauna and a steam room. For this locker room, you do not need to bring a lock in; the lockers have keypad locks on them. The women's showers are very clean and complimentary soap, shampoo, conditioner, and razors are provided. Throughout the locker room are also hairdryers.\n\nAdmittedly, they also intentionally or unintentionally provide a LOT of motivation to work out! If you're in certain age groups, you might get a free heart rate monitor that shows your heart rate while you are working out on the little TV screens they have throughout the gym. This is definitely helpful when working out. And although it's not an expensive product, it is apparently \"free\" if you meet certain goals for 3 months, which gives you enough reason to want to go to the gym and meet the required goals!\n\nThe bad:\nThe prices are only good if you're within a certain age group. I am in the youngest age group so the prices are reasonable at $52-$62 monthly. As you get older, the prices get worse, and they are terrible for those in what I think is the 32-64 age bracket, at $141+ a month and a several hundred dollar enrollment fee on top of that. So I would definitely recommend this athletic center to people within the 10-24 age bracket if you're worried about costs (and let's be honest, who isn't?)\n\nSecondly, the caf\u00e9 food I thought was pretty good until a few hours after eating it. Yesterday I tried the power up skillet with quinoa, an egg, sausage, peppers, and mushrooms, and I was in severe gastrointestinal distress for the entire day, to the point where I almost went home from work. I used the bathroom 4-5 times and felt horrible in between each time. Today as well, I tried it again to confirm that it was definitely that food that caused it, and I kid you not, I am on the toilet writing this right now and have not been feeling well. This is an extremely rare occurrence for me and didn't happen on the days I didn't try the food, so I'm left to believe that it was the food that caused this. I won't be trying most of their food again. Perhaps a smoothie in the future but even that I can't be sure of as of right now, as my stomach kills me.\n\nNext, anything outside of what's provided with the basic membership (which is plenty enough) is a waste of money or a luxury for those who can afford it. Most of the extras are incredibly expensive. For instance, I saw swimming lessons (not aquatic exercise) at $60 for a 50 minute class with several other people. Not even individual lessons! I myself don't even make $10+ every ten minutes, so I find it hard to pay that much to someone else, especially if the lessons are individual lessons.\n\nAnd finally, they make it impossibly difficult to get out of their contract without spending a lot of money unless you become basically disabled during the contract period. But I guess that's anywhere, right?\n\nTL;DR: This place is awesome at the 10-24 year-old rates, given all that it offers.

She gave out various objects to the other kids to help in the lesson, but completely left us out, not coming over to us or speaking to us once.  I endured this for 20 of the 30 minutes of class until I got fed up and just left.  This would be rude and unacceptable at any price point, but for nearly $20 per session, this was unforgivable.

Even on weekends when they don't have classes, my wife and I go to work out, and my kids are THRILLED to go to the kids club.

There is ALWAYS a piece of cardio equipment available. There's space to jump rope. There's multiple spaces for what I call \"functional training\" - flipping tires/pushing & pulling sleds, etc. There is ALWAYS something new to try as well. TRX,  Spinning, cross-training, yoga, pilates (reformer and floor) all kinds of aerobics. Also leagues and clubs of all kinds if you want to play some kind of competitive sport. Lastly,  the club is always looking to improve, and constantly adding new services. \n\nI've even worked out with a couple personal trainers there, and they are rock solid.

The girl said no, then went to her manager and he said no. So I went to him, explained I'm an adaptive climber and our home gym accommodates me. He said he would call the owners. He came back, again telling me no they could not accommodate by letting me change the rope on ONE route. So I spent money to climb one route in this playground because I'm using my upper body alone. Gotta love being punished for being paralyzed.

Prior to joining I was a member of Bally's and compared to them the equipment is great and the trainers are very knowledgeable.  Generally I like to run on the treadmill and do free weights and I have never had to wait more than 5 minutes to use the equipment.\n\nThe equipment seems to be well maintained and whenever a treadmill is out they generally have it back up and running within a week.  They have other facilities such as a steam room, sauna, and tanning both but I have never tried using them.\n\nI haven't paid for any personal training but received one free session when I signed up and the trainer I worked with was very knowledgeable without pressuring me to sign up for training.  Having looked over the qualifications of the trainers it looks like they are all appropriately certified and experienced.  There is always at least one trainer on the floor of the gym and they have always been happy to help me out with a spot or provide advice if I am unsure about a piece of equipment.\n\nWe've done a few of the classes at CH&F and they have always been well taught but I would say that classes aren't the strong aspect of this gym.  If you want a lot of classes and great variety you might want to look elsewhere but for a clean, well-maintained, well-staffed gym this is the best we have found in the area.\n\nIf you go during the day (I work from home quite often and will go during lunch) you can have problems parking because the parking lot is shared with a number of businesses.  I've had a few times where I have left in frustration but generally I am able to find a spot.  In the evenings this isn't a problem.\n\nAs with all gyms you should read the fine-print before signing the contract.  They will automatically renew you at the month-to-month rate if you do not renew for a year or cancel two months in advance.  Unfortunately this seems to be the standard way of doing business in this industry (at least in my experience).  However, the owner is very understanding and if you do run in to a situation where you forgot to renew just go in and talk to him and you can usually work it out.

Customer service and upgrades are severely lacking, but the tucked away location allows for low crowds of people.\n\nThe main reason I go to Conshy Health & Fitness is because it's walking distance from my workplace in the Spring Mill corporate center. If it weren't so damn convenient, you would definitely not find me here. Its customers seem like mostly normal people, with the occasional bro wandering in and doing shoulder shrugs in front of all the dumbbells.\n\nEquipment: There's a good number of aerobic machines (treadmills, ellipticals, bikes), but the weights, benches, etc. are lacking. The dumbbells are old and rusted, there are only 2 flat benches, 1 incline, 1 decline, and only 2-3 bars to go around between the 4. Fortunately, this isn't usually a problem because the gym never gets too crowded (a definite benefit). The rest of the equipment is useable, but still could use upkeep.\n\nClasses: I've never done the classes, but my roommate says they're fine. They do a crossfit class on Wednesdays in the morning, which is annoying for the rest of the gym since they use a bunch of different sections.\n\nTraining: Private training exists, albeit few and far between, but there are NO trainers who watch the floor, so there are no rules to follow and no one to spot you.\n\nStaff: Staff seem generally nice, albeit bored most of the time. They aren't the friendliest and don't go out of their way to get to know people, but they aren't unfriendly either.\n\nLocker Rooms: The locker rooms are nice (at least the men's is), and has a sauna and showers in it.\n\nPrice: I pay $34.99 monthly, and I think the yearly plans are a bit cheaper than that.\n\nOverall\nPros:\n-$35 a month is okay\n-Almost never crowded\n-Customers are relatively normal people\n-Has a sports drink fridge (not included in the price, though)\n\nCons:\n-No trainers on site except for private lessons\n-NO rules to follow and so people use multiple machines, do what they want, etc.\n-Equipment is older\n-No real sports equipment or basketball court (there is one hoop, but it's outdated and in the class room)\n-Doesn't seem to be a community built around the gym\n-No workout towels or other amenities\n\nOverall, if you're working in the area, it's a bad option, but it's convenient.

Same exact dust bunnies everywhere, no more towel service.\nNot vacuuming and cleaning daily is alarming. All sorts of bro fungus festering in here - you're going to get sick. Very sick. \n\nAlright settle in, kids - Iceman's gonna drop some real talk on you here:\n\nFirst of all, this is a brand new facility that somehow manages to remain pretty filthy. Don't believe me, Axiom staff? Take a peek around your jungle gym station - pretty sure those dust bunnies have established a political structure and are launching a space program soon. \nYou've had a broken faucet in the men's locker room for a month. Inexcusable. \nYou have an uncovered towel drop in the locker room, which is not particularly sanitary but more so is just disgusting, especially when it's the first thing you see upon entering.\nThe one or two maintenance people you employ are friendly and industrious, but you need more of them. If you go to any quality fitness club in a major city, you will see staff cleaning not only the locker rooms, but the equipment itself at least once an hour. I have yet to see anyone cleaning equipment at this location. That is troubling.\nIt should not be the responsibility of the member to spray the equipment - people are lazy and just won't do it. If you want them to wipe down machines, replace the spray bottles with Clorox wipes. It's easier and you won't have soggy used rags soaking up bacteria all over your facility. \nYour water fountains are visibly harboring mold cultures and probably shouldn't be used until you figure out how to clean them. Inexcusable. \n\nMoving on... \n\nFront desk staff are the typical disinterested college types, normally seen texting and avoiding eye contact rather than even faking good customer service. \nI'm not sure if there is any in-club management - if there is, he/she/they are not visible which tells me that they don't really care. \n\nNext, can we please for the love of Goose's widow lose the '80s and '90s pop music??? You are the only gym not named Curves that still plays that crap. \nYou want the truth in fitness? Your music blows. At least stock some headphones in your shop area for those who may experience suicidal tendencies from your playlist.\n\nNext, why do you have multiple TRX stations, but no TRXs available for anyone to use? Are you that concerned of theft? Why not purchase a few of the handy dandy TRX ceiling mounts? \n\nWhy do you have a \"track\" if one lane serves no purpose other than to house your kettlebells and rowing machines? Poor design as well, as the far lane isn't even really a whole lane because of the nearby windows. \n\nWhich is a nice segue to the next point - lack of equipment as a result of poor layout and lack of space. \nHex deadlift bar? Nope. \nViPRs? Nope. \nDual cable/pull-up station? Nope. (Side note, how can you have ONE cable station for an entire facility? That is absurd, especially during peak hours.)\nOh, but we've got curl bars up the wazoo! You can do curls all day here at Axiom. No waiting!\nAgain, the whole truth in fitness thing is a joke. Axiom was absolutely taken to the cleaners by whomever coined that tagline. \nThe truth in fitness is that a decline bench serves no practical purpose and you have several machines that can cause serious injury as they promote dysfunctional movement and harmful torque - Smith machine, quad/hamstring extensions, etc. \nImagine what you could have done with the space occupied by unnecessary equipment and your \"Cardio Theater\". Rather than have two people ride a stationary bike while watching Caddyshack, you could have installed more practical equipment and training space, which right now is virtually nonexistent. \n\nAnd how about a no cell phone policy? That's a no brainer in this day and age. It's one thing to keep your workout on your mobile device for reference, but there is absolutely no place for phone calls on the fitness floor or in the locker room. \n(Hey management, this would be a great opportunity for you to come out of your cave and establish a presence!)\n\nAs the Treasure Valley continues to grow, it's only a matter of time before a LifeTime Fitness or Equinox moves in and puts Axiom out to pasture. This is a convenient, low-cost option geared towards bros and people who like to listen to Garth Brooks and Mariah Carey while they work out. Poor atmosphere, poor customer service, poor layout. \n\nThis is all a reflection on the corporate strategy, or lack thereof. The branding and marketing is illogical - there is no \"truth in fitness\" reflected in anything happening in this facility, and the hyped-up Perx program offers incentives to pizza parlors and tanning beds, which, last I checked, were not the cornerstones of a healthy lifestyle. \n\nAs someone who has spent his entire life in front of a mirror flashing his pearly whites, the Iceman knows a thing or two about gyms. Without serious investments in marketing and operations, Axiom is headed for a rude awakening. Book it.\n\nIceman", "date": "2015-02-21 06:17:10"}, {"_key": "397478", "_id": "reviews/397478", "_rev": "_fNysA8m--B", "review_id": "z4NAOaMrzv_prpRhBTAEBQ", "user_id": "t2smC8SBZ8BUV0qNb8heDw", "business_id": "eJvvX5j_L5my7bAtcdLdQg", "stars": 1, "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I went in to talk about gaining a membership.

As someone who hates running, I was apprehensive about being on a treadmill 50% of the time, but I actually kind of enjoy it!  Here are my highlights: \n\nRunning\n-Woodway treadmills - I'm no aficionado, but I do think they feel a little better to run on - easier on the joints\n-TV screens - 3 options that tell you exactly what speed and incline to use.  I like this so that I don't have to try and listen for the instructor to tell me.  Bonus: it provides a timer so you know exactly how long you need to be crushing it at high speeds.  \n-No one is looking at anyone else, because we're all focused on running through the streets of some CA city\n\nStrength\n-Everyone has their own bench with weights already underneath.  I love this because if I start an exercise and my weights are too heavy or light, it's an easy switch.  I don't have to go to the other side of the room to get additional weights\n-The instructor demos the moves for you, so you can actually see how to do it.  The person at the desk will tell you which spot to go in, and if they see that you are new, they'll put you in a good spot to see the instructor.  \n\nOther\n-They have a few separate shower rooms to get ready in the morning, with what looks like plenty of amenities to get ready in the morning.  The shower rooms are separate from the locker area, so I'm curious to see what mornings are like, if there is a big hold up while people get dressed in the shower rooms before doing hair/makeup in the locker room.  \n-Vibe - I like the club atmosphere and the music, it definitely gets me pumped up to workout.  I also really like that it doesn't feel competitive.  Everyone is focused on their own TV screens and not looking around.

There are simply too many variables to know what you're getting when joining. I think the key to health club excellence lies within the value. In other words, the higher the price, the better machines and amenities it must offer. Cleanliness is a must! I'm already more germophobic than any sane person and health clubs are like a petri dish - except with extra petri! And finally, it's the peeps you end up working out with. A building full of douchebags wouldn't be so bad if they were wearing headbands, half-shirts and were sporting feathered hair like in 80's movies. All you'd have to do is rig a cake to fall on their head cake which is apparently embarrassing enough that everyone finally realizes what a jerk that dude is and then you get the girl and blah blah blah. Of course, novelty douchebags are a dying breed. Real douchebags can ruin a gym. So where does Fitness Factory fall?\n\nI've joined low cost clubs and high cost clubs and both have their plusses and minuses. The Fitness Factory sits square in the area of mid-range coming in at around $50 a month. The question is, what do you get for that 50 bones?\n\nFirst of all, you get decent machines. They aren't brand new, or top-of-the-line (at least the cardio machines aren't) but they aren't horrible. The weight areas are abundant so you can almost always find an area to use even when it's crowded, which it often is. Still, for the price, the machines are where Fitness Factory takes a hit value-wise. \n\nSadly, the same goes for the amenities. There's gated parking around the corner which is nice, but also was recently closed for over a month for seemingly no good reason. It wasn't that big of a deal considering they just pointed you to the gated lot next store, but it was still annoying that no work was being done to our former parking spots. \n\nWhile they do provide you with lockers with built in coded security, the most annoying aspect of Fitness Factory is the towel situation. Yeah, sometimes they run out. Actually, a lot of times they run out. It happens pretty much every night around 6. My co-workers probably think it's sooo funny that I race out of the office to go work out. I'm way too proud to tell them that it's because of a towel. \n\nThe one saving grace of the shortness of towels is that it probably means they are washing them. This is a plus on my mental cleanliness chart. Everything else seems fairly clean except for the treadmills which have some weird crud in the cup-holders. Come to think of it, that's pretty effing gross. The good news is that I've never had an instance where the building smelled bad. Even the locker rooms are well maintained! Well, I can't vouch for the girls room, but in all my years of bathroom research, I've concluded the cleanliness ratio on women's to men's rooms is 4 to 1. This means the women's room at the Fitness Factory is shiny in some way.\n\nOther than it's location, the best thing about the Fitness Factory seems to be the people. Everyone that I've come across are more than helpful and the many people who member there are gracious. In other words the douchebag level is low. It's notable that this isn't a show off gym. Sure, there are some very fit people working out, but it's always without fanfare. No ridiculous grunting or unnecessary weight slamming. You'll also find many people out of shape there. The trainers have a seemingly good reputation and I've heard quite a few success stories. \n\nIn the end what you have is a gym that's pretty average. Nothing too awesome and nothing too bad. Not that it needs to be. First and foremost, gyms are for working out and that's what everyone is doing there. Socializing is rare. If I can go in and get my workout done while remaining comfortable in my surroundings I'm happy.

Although for me, Orange Theory seems like a place I could get used to without becoming bored. \n\nIt is a high intensity interval training workout with a combination of cardio and weight training. Each class is 60 minutes, while an instructor guides and ultimately pushes you through this group workout. Half the workout is done on a treadmill and row machine, while the other half is done on the open floor that provides dumbbells, trx etc. It essentially becomes a circuit. However many rounds you can get through with the allotted time. What's important to know is that you are competing with the clock, not the people around you! If you don't finish your reps or even get to it at all, it's no worries..as long as you did your best that you could do. They may call out who ran the fastest mile or 2000 meter row, but not every class is like that.  \n\nIf you're new, you must show up 30 minutes before the class begins to fill out paperwork and to go over everything. They start your free trial off with a heart rate monitor that connects to the flat screens above with your name. It shows your progress and end results as to how many calories you burned, what your max push was during the workout, etc. This will explain the \"orange theory\" being that the orange level on the bar graph will determine the hardest you worked and gives you an idea where you should be or want to work up to.\n\nYou are not required to purchase a monitor there or wear one at all, but they are available at an extra cost and are a bit pricey..\n\nSo far, everyone has been helpful and genuine.

I LOVE orangetheory fitness SO much.   Let me add that i have a  VERY long history of dropping out of gyms.  I would enthusiastically  sign up and never see the inside of the place again.  My most recent foray was to a nearby upscale gym (Virtua) which cost almost 2 x what i pay at Orangetheory.  It was nice, but not very fun, motivating, or engaging.  I went and just mindlessly plodded along on the treadmill/elliptical/etc. without much purpose in my self-directed program.  Of course, i didn't get any results - mainly because i wasn't working very hard.  it was VERY easy to do just the minimum.  \n\nAt Orangetheory, it could not be more different.  Everyone moves a a pace that is challenging for them (which is different for everyone).  You have the benefits of a class (motivating to be around others who are obviously working hard), but it is a competition with ONLY yourself.  The heart rate monitors are super helpful in taking the mystery out of - how hard are you working?  Previously, i've been sweaty, panting and breathless, but i wasn't working hard like this.  And the results are definitely coming.  I could not even do a push up when i started!  Now, i can do several sets (after only a few short weeks - like 8 i think?)  \n\nLastly, i just want to mention how helpful, constructive and delightful everyone who works there is.  I have a nagging back injury which prevents certain movements for me, and my trainer, Anthony, could not be more helpful, patient or accommodating.  he always scales movements and provides alternatives.  he often corrects my form in a super helpful way.  it is so wonderfully helpful.  In addition, the staff of the gym, the front desk and the manager Rachel are extremely extremely helpful.  Always happy, it's obvious that everyone loves working there !!

In one month I have lost 8 lbs and can notice considerably more muscle definition in my shoulders, arms and legs. In addition to great classes, the trainers are happy to share advice on other fitness topics from nutrition to exercises you can do at home. The online scheduler RowZone uses makes it easy to find classes that fit into your schedule, just be sure to be considerate and don't cancel at the last minute or fail to show up at all as there can sometimes be a wait list of other rowers who would like to get in the class.\n\nOne last point I'd like to make is the sense of community that RowZone fosters.

Row zone popped up so I went ahead and purchased the 3 pack intro class. I signed up for my first of three, threw my workout gear on, and set foot for the gym one day after work. The instructor, who I will not name so as to not call out, said I could pick any rower, spent about 30 secs with me showing me proper form, and we were off on our workout. My experience fell short of my expectations, so much so that I dont know that Ill use the other 2 classes that I already paid for. So yeah, the 2 star rating is feeling more appropriate for me here. \n\nHere is what fell flat to me: \n- there were about 20 different movements for the class and each were covered in about 5 seconds, of which I couldnt retain all of that info so quickly so I was lost a lot in the workout \n- the instructor made me feel really unwelcome when they were making jokes about the two girls not saving the rower next to them for their friend who came in late (clearly the one I was on), so sorry to be the new person....\n- the class was all women, with the exception of one man. the instructor never acknowledged or gave feedback to the guy, only the women in the class\n- the instructor seemed a bit too chummy with some of the women, it was a bit odd for me\n- the instructor yelled through the class, no need for that friend \n- the people there weren't exactly the friendliest to me, even though I made it a point to share with a few different people that I was new (you know sometimes a gym is a great place to make friends when you are older and new to a city)\n\nHere is what worked for me\n- clean equipment \n- decent workout \n- decent music \n- I liked the variation of rowing and workouts \n- the workout was listed in a few places so it was readable almost anywhere in the gym\n\nI did try to give the gym another shot so as to use at least one more of my classes so one night this week I registered for a morning class.

So, the $100+ membership I paid for was converted unilaterally from a five-days-a-week to a one-day-a-week class.  When I signed up for the classes, I was told that I could use some non-7:00 a.m. class time to make up for missed time due to prepaid vacation and work trips in early December.

It was a Living Social coupon that brought me here, and I had no idea what to expect. So let me fill you in on what to expect. \n\nEach session is a near constant 45 minute work out. It alternates between x amount of time on a rowing machine and exercises that you stand up and do next to your machine. So you might row for 300 meters, then get off of the machine and do 10-20 reps of squats, an abdominal exercise (some type of plank or sit up), or light weights. Then you do it again. \n\nIt is not a gym. There are free lockers. There are also two bathrooms if you need to change before and after the exercise. There are about 20 rowing machines, so that that is the max size of each class. Classes are offered in the early morning (usually 6 am, 7 am), noon, and in the evening (5:30 pm, 6:30 pm, 7:30 pm). and in the mornings on weekends. There are several instructors. They are VERY supportive. None of them mess around -- you are getting a 45 minute workout. No two classes are exactly the same because they are always changing the combinations and lengths of exercises. \n\nYou can pay by the class or get them as a package. For example, I signed up for \"six weeks to awesomeness\", which is any session for a total of 3 per week (so now I'm officially awesome). There is also an unlimited where you can go once per day as many days per week as you want for a month. \n\nIf you haven't done this before, then I would just start by buying a few classes or look for the the coupon on Living Social. If you like it, then I would jump in. If you really want results, then I would ultimately get the unlimited and then straight line depreciate that by going as often as you can, if not every day.

So, naturally, I enrolled him in a class that would make his strikes more deadly! \n\nWell, no.  Actually, I discovered that other parents found help for their similarly-disposed children via the martial arts.  Many said that the emphasis on discipline and focus was the reason.  Others said it was their child's increased confidence.   Whichever reason, they were saying it worked, so I was intrigued.  But I was also cautious.  I didn't want this to become another \"you damn well are going to practice\" struggle, ending with an unused violin in the closet.  Or whatever the karate equivalent to that would be.  \n\nI discovered the website for Church's Karate Academy, and the price and length of the trial package was fantastic.  Low output of cash, two months, uniform included.  After that, you enroll at the regular monthly rate, or you walk away.  No strings.  Not bad!  I went to the studio with the intention of enrolling my son.  So glad I did!!  \n\nIf you go to the website expecting to find information about the studio, please don't be put off.  The website is flashy, but it's also a bit generic, offering reasons why studying the martial arts is a good choice but no sense of Master Church or his studio.   Frankly, the website feels like more of a sales pitch than much else, but that is not how Master Church himself is.  \n\nThe studio works like this.  Karate students are placed in a class group based on their age and expertise.  Master Church holds classes for each of those groups five or six days per week at regularly scheduled times.  You attend two of those classes per week, and he tracks this via an attendance card.  You do not have to commit to particular classes.  For example, if you can normally attend on Mondays and Wednesdays, but something comes up one Wednesday, you can go to the Monday and Friday class for your group instead.  Or, if you split custody, perhaps it's easier for Mom to take Kid on Tues and Wed but Dad to take kid on Wed and Sat.  No problem.  No need to tell Master Church in advance.  Just show up to whichever two classes per week for your group.  So flexible.  \n\nAs for Master Church, enough cannot be said about how great of a teacher he is.   It's obvious that he genuinely cares about and believes in them.  In return, they want to do well and can't stand the thought of disappointing him.  He's that kind of teacher.  If you have ever had such a teacher yourself, you know their magic.  He is firm, though, not a push over, and he has their respect for that. I eventually even enrolled a certain violin quitter, and she loves it. \n\nWhat's more?  I honestly cannot remember the last time my son hit me, although I'm sure I'm just as frustrating as ever.", "date": "2015-03-12 15:30:22"}, {"_key": "1161509", "_id": "reviews/1161509", "_rev": "_fNyr4Eu--T", "review_id": "QIdcqDisX9GOzHu9PPIDOQ", "user_id": "-CdMUy8T2Z-K3UmPtvkKCg", "business_id": "dqWk-PLqY2_TgW1SdfUyew", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I love the kickboxing program!

I am accustomed to huge two story locations with day cares, tons of mirrors, full locker rooms, pools, saunas, packed schedule of classes.  Now the offset of that (back in the day) was that you were in some crazy contract for ever and paying 40-60 bucks a month.  Although pricing changes for each location and depending on the placement of the moon and the sky, most people at anytime fitness have a 1 year contract for between 20-30 bucks.  So, you know, you get what you pay for. \n\nAt this location, as compared to my experience at Bullard location, you may get a little less than you pay for.  The space is extremely cramped. That being said the equipment is quality equipment, they do have the standard classes, and it is generally clean. There are no lockers just cubby holes by the member entrance/exit door.  The parking lot can get crowded when the dance studio and dojo are having classes.  The classes fill up and it gets dangerously crowded and hot in the studio.  There is one shower.  Fortunately, I haven't had to wait for cardio equipment.  Most of the people working out at the time I am there are in class or are on weights.\n\nI think the most annoying thing about this location is the service. By the time I arrive at 6 or 7 in the evening, the staff has zoned completely out.  They are nice but not at all proactive.  The first time I went to this location, one of the members let me in the front door and I stood there for a good 2 minutes before I had to then go in to the office and say, hey I am here on a free pass.  No tour was given, no information about classes (until I asked), no policies, and no membership prices.  I loved that it wasn't a hard sell but I expect 1) for people to be aware of people coming in and out of the locations and 2) for you to care and follow up with me on whether I had a good experience or not. Also, with the classes, the teacher was late and her music skipped.  However, everybody has an off day so I am going to reserve my final opinion on that.  Especially since her zumba choreography was fire!\n\nFor me, working in CBD and living in New Orleans East, this location is more convenient because I can stop there on my way home.

Worst of all, is the women's locker room! Doors falling off of the lockers. The toilets haven't been cleaned in FOREVER. The shower curtains literally have gaping holes in them. What's the point of a shower curtain?! For paying $30 a month and an annual $30 fee, I am highly disappointed in platinum.

CityFitness sets you up with a one month trial membership. This is awesome because it's not just limited to the spin classes offered on the pass, and you can utilize the gym for any of the services available to a trial membership. \n\nMy experience with the trial membership was fairly frustrating. I have a gym in my building so all I really wanted to do was take spin classes. Recently CityFitness switched to an online class sign-up system. I'm sure it's convenient for members but it's not available for anyone with a trial membership. Trial members have to call up the front desk and request to be manually added to the class list. For both members and trial members, each class opens 24 hours in advance. \n\nThe sign-up process doesn't seem like a big problem, however I was a huge fan of the 6:30pm Monday spin class with Steve. CityFitness closes at 6PM on Sundays. By the time the gym reopened on Monday morning, the class was typically full.\n\nThis speaks very highly to this class and the instructor, Steve. I enjoyed every moment of each class I was able to attend. He is lively, enthusiastic, motivating, friendly, encouraging and just overall fantastic. When my husband and I first started, we took the beginner class where he took the time to teach us proper set-up and technique. Aside from being a great teacher, his music selection was killer. I could only imagine what a bad song set could do to a class, but his music selections were upbeat and perfect for spin. \n\nI wasn't thrilled with the spin studio itself. Throughout my experience I personally came across some faulty bikes, from pedal straps that wouldn't tighten to seats that wouldn't adjust. During one class, one classmate was spinning so hard that a pedal broke while he was on the bike. I'm not sure if/when it was fixed but that eliminated one spot in the class for however long it was out of commission. \n\nSo long story short: Steve rocked but based on the condition of the studio and the billing issues I've heard about, I will not be buying a membership to CityFitness.", "date": "2014-07-15 16:18:18"}, {"_key": "247729", "_id": "reviews/247729", "_rev": "_fNyr7S2--K", "review_id": "FPzc10-kNYXaItrfFTp66g", "user_id": "4UAqdgiCe1jwI1IQl96MIA", "business_id": "Tm3QiAVLJAR2fEJK7APPPQ", "stars": 2, "useful": 4, "funny": 2, "cool": 1, "text": "I was considering signing up, when I phoned to ask if they have a jacuzzi and indoor, heated swimming pool, the man on the phone told me that they do not have either.

I've been a gym member since I was 16 - at Aquatic Fitness Center, LA Fitness, The Firm (of Marlton, NJ), and Planet Fitness.  In all my years, I've never been greeted by name with a high five and sometimes a conversation.  They've got my schedule down, they know when I'm coming in for the most part, they even know what I'm reading.  And not in a creepy way.  They know I love my spin classes and when I come in they hand me over the red class card immediately because they already know that's where I'm going.  They've even got my keys memorized!\n\nI utilized their fitness assessment when I first joined, and I got really worried that I was going to be pressured and ostracized until I bought a personal training package.  Not the case at all.  Tony was super helpful, and had a ton of information, and there was no beef at all when I didn't want to sign up.  He's still friendly, fixes my form if he sees me, and he too also comments on my reading ha.  \n\nSpinning Intructor Carl is another amazing staff member.  His classes are energetic, and even though it pisses me off that he'll call me by name to sprint (or call me out on not going fast enough) he challenges me to perform and that pays off.  He's inpsired me to get my own certification that I'm very excited to utilize.\n\nThe gym itself gets crowded after work hours, but the parking isn't terrible and there's street parking on Green.

I used to play lacrosse. (Sure, I rode the bench, but I still practiced like a winner.) I used to strength train with a former Romanian World Cup soccer player who looked eerily like John Travolta from Pulp Fiction on many, many steroids. (True story; 2006 was a weird year for me.) I used to eat right, drink plenty of water, and take all my essential vitamins. I was young, virile, and full of energy, ready to live a long and eventful life free of prescription medications.\n\nAnd then I discovered beer.\n\nYears of the sauce coupled with limited time for exercise (Damn you, soul-crushing job!) made me into a pretty average, pretty chunky little twenty-something. Recently, I decided to do something about it. \n\nI began researching the plethora of gyms scattered throughout our fair city, only to discover that waiting tables could never afford me any of them. I heard great things about some of the bigger chains (*cough* SWEAT *cough*) but I simply could not afford their monthly rates. Then an angel in the form of a buddy from work told me about an incredible deal in Northern Liberties. Given how much I missed being in shape, I had to check it out, and I did just that.\n\nI've been going 4 times a week ever since. \n\nNow, before we talk about the machines, the size of the place, or the classes, let's head off on another path. If you (yes, you) are a follower of my few reviews on here, you may have noticed a theme: I have a secret love for personality displayed in the staff of the spots I frequent. (If you noticed, gold star for you. If not, accept it as absolute truth and carry on reading.) Anyhow, the first thing you notice upon entering City Fitness is the staff. And this staff has definite personality. Everyone smiles. Everyone greets you. If they remember you from the day before, they let you know. If they saw you doing a weird exercise, they ask you about it. Here's the important part, kiddies: THEY MAKE YOU FEEL WELCOME. One of the biggest problems I've encountered in the gyms I've attended in the past has been a general feeling of indifference emanated by the workers. They didn't care whether or not I was there, and I was therefore usually too intimidated or put off to ask them for assistance. Often, this little indifference is what caused me to cancel my membership. Somehow, I don't foresee that happening at City Fitness.\n\nThe gym itself is huge. A converted warehouse, it has a little bit of everything. The main room consists of the weight section (combination of free weights, benches, and varying machines), the cardio section (50-something pieces of cardio equipment, each with their own LCD TV attached), a stretching/aerobic section (that could admittedly be bigger), and the smoothie bar, which boasts some of the best original recovery shakes I've ever had. They even create specialty recipes for the holidays! Trust me, you're sorry you missed the Thanksgiving Pumpkin Pie shake.\n\nAside from the main room, City Fitness also has dedicated spinning and yoga rooms, each adorned appropriately, as well as a multi-purpose room used for many of the classes offered.\n\nWait, did he just say classes? Yeah, he did. CF has a lot of them. They offer the traditional fare, like the aforementioned yoga and spinning, as well as some more cutting edge classes, like kettle bells and core-centric bridal bootcamps. (Not my cup o' tea, but hey) Different trainers handle different classes, each according to their own personal specialty, and from what I've seen, they kick your ass.\n\nNow, that last sentence implies that I don't actually take the classes offered. I don't, and the reason for that is because they cost extra money when added to your monthly membership. Ah, the catch... Actually, most things at CF add a few dollars to your membership fee to utilize fully. Classes, towel service, and locker rentals all increase your very reasonable starting fee and make it... still incredibly reasonable. Seriously, I've done the math, and even if I were to add the fee for taking classes to my membership, I'd be paying less than a basic membership at Sweat. That, friends, is superb.\n\nSo, if you've been following along, you've come to realize that City Fitness is a large, friendly wellness center with a little bit of everything for everyone that won't break the bank and is easy to get to. (It's literally 40 paces from the Spring Garden El stop.) The question is, with this information in hand, why the hell aren't you there yet? When you do go, look for me.

Since then, I've seen a lot of improvement in the facilities (lockers, equipment, enabling digital sign up for classes and general work out areas).  I think they could improve by making their contracts and pricing more flexible, transparent and easy to understand to those who are members and non-members to truly support their mission of helping people get in shape and be well.  Also, their spin studio could use a remodel and upgrade - they may want to look at competitors that are creeping in from NYC (e.g. Fly Wheel) as something to aspire to since spin has become super trendy in the past couple years.  They'd get more people involved in those classes, which would lead to happier clients.\n\nMy favorite parts of the gym are the people that work there.  For me, the gems of the gym are Angela, Richard, and my Thrive gym family.\n\nWhen I walk in the door, I'm created by Angela, who's the friendliest and best customer service rep I've ever met.  She brightens my mornings and puts me in a positive frame of mind when I work out and when I leave to start my day.  She's a gem of this gym.\n\nRichard Gross is by far one of the best trainers I've had the opportunity and fortune to work through my fitness goals with.  He's motivating and inspiring; as he practices what he preaches by running multiple races and training himself on top of the work he does to help his client's achieve their full potential.  I've trained with him one-on-one and through semi-private training; he always tailors each workout to my individual needs and goals, pushing me to work harder each day.  The focus that Rich has helped me achieve in my workouts has positively impacted my work and life.

The sinks are ridiculous. They have pressure valves where the water barely trickles out and its all cold. Shaving or brushing your teeth is impossible. The water pressure in the showers is not much better and there is no where to hang your towel or place your soap or shampoo. Even worse, the showers face the crappers so you are surrounded by a real nice aroma while you are trying to get clean. They have a sauna but its never hot. What's worse is the culture at this gym is to go into the sauna fully clothed with shoes on. Guys prop their dirty shoes (I've even seen workboots) up on the benches. This is no spa-like sauna.

I went in to redeem my voucher and take my first class yesterday.\n\nI arrived at the gym around 5:20, thinking this was plenty of time to fill out any paper work and get ready to attend the 5:45 \"Beginner Spin\" class. I had to stand at the front desk for 3-5 minutes before anyone even acknowledged me, then was not very warmly welcomed when I explained my reason for coming in. The computer systems were slow and had to be \"cross-referenced\" at two different desks (not really sure why, nor did I get an explanation or apology for the inconvenience). Anyway, I was finally brought my waiver form, filled it out, and was asked to screenshot the groupon on my phone and send it to the representative's personal email (again, not sure why, as I already redeemed it with her when I walked in).\n\nOnce that was taken care of I wasn't offered a tour of the facility or given a towel that were being handed to every one else who walked through the door. In fact, I wasn't offered anything. As soon as I was done with my paperwork the woman assisting me told me to have a great work out and sat back at her desk. I had to ask where the locker room and spin room were on my own.\n\nAlready frustrated with my front desk experience, I was still hopeful I would have a good class. I got into the spin room at 5:40 for the 5:45 class, only to find out it had already started! And the class wasn't just warming up, they were clearly already into their first or second song. This was also frustrating as the class was on the schedule from 5:45-6:30. There were a few others who entered the room after me too, who seemed just as surprised to see the class already in full swing.\n\nI would consider myself an intermediate spinner, but if I was truly a beginner, this class would not make me want to try spinning again. There was barely any interaction from the instructor, and we repeated the same hurdle sequence for every song. The instructor didn't push the class to add resistance, or switch up the sequence (I'm used to spin classes varying between hurdles, long distance hills, sprints, etc) and if I did not have prior experience I would not have known how to push myself on my own. And that's one of the reasons most people opt for group fitness instead of working out on their own...the added push of the instructors and peers. This class wasn't very communal. Not to mention the music selection wasn't my cup of tea...lots of indie and classic rock, which I love listening to, but quite monotonous for working out especially if you're not being motivated by your instructor on top of that.\n\nAround 6:10 the instructor said we'd do one last song and then cool down, so even after arriving earlier than the designated time, I barely got a half hour of spinning in. At the end, I asked another instructor who was in the class helping people get set up on their bikes (I think his name was Steve...he was pretty nice) if it was typical for the class to start early, and he said yes. If this is normal, the time should be shifted on the online schedule and the schedules hanging up around the gym so that members can plan accordingly.\n\nI still have 9 classes left on my Groupon and I'm hopeful I'll have a better experience than this one, but looking through the rest of the Yelp reviews, I can't say I'm too optimistic.", "date": "2015-07-21 14:46:11"}, {"_key": "402964", "_id": "reviews/402964", "_rev": "_fNysBIm--M", "review_id": "mqIyYU3fIxrcZwi7fWs3mg", "user_id": "toQe9adQWV7iC7KM_eugsA", "business_id": "Tm3QiAVLJAR2fEJK7APPPQ", "stars": 2, "useful": 7, "funny": 3, "cool": 2, "text": "Firstly I want to know where all the reviews went for this place.

I loved working out with them, and saw fantastic results in a short time. Twice a week was enough for me gain strength, tone and stamina.\n\nThe facilities themselves are okay. Not fantastic, but not bad. The locker rooms stink, and the showers are gross. They offer no towels, terrible mirror area and other amenities. The machines are new and I could usually find one to use, which was good.\n\nClass options are few and far between, but Body Pump and the 20/20/20 one were fun. Spinning was also decent.\n\nWhy one star then? This place is run unethically beyond belief. I'm a patient and forgiving person, but cannot believe how I was treated when I left. Keep in mind my office MOVED so I no longer am anywhere near the gym. I didn't leave out of unhappiness or for a negative reason, but was forced to do so and choose a gym closer to my new office.\n\nWhen it came time to cancel, I gave them 30 days notice on my training. I have my signed contract which requires NO notice, but was then told I had a pending payment in 21 days that could not be canceled. Essentially I'd have 8 more sessions than I could use, nothing around that. While I was annoyed, I figured I could use them up at some point in the future.\n\nFast forward to 12 weeks later. I've been charged TWO extra times, $199 each, and have called them now 11 times. That is not an exaggeration. I've spoken to several employees, all who agree these are incorrect charges and I should be refunded. I was even told that the refund was processed, but it's been nearly two weeks since and I see nothing on my credit card statement.\n\nLet me make this clear: BEWARE of City Fitness. They are worse about treating past clients with respect than any gym I've ever been a member of, including large and infamously negative chains. They WILL keep charging you and if you aren't diligent about it they won't stop. \n\nAt this point I've been forced to contact my credit card company and file chargeback requests, as well as the BBB.

I pay $29.99 a month for unlimited classes.  I joined because I wanted access to yoga classes without paying yoga studio prices.  I had to pay a $39.99 fee additionally after three months membership to \"secure\" my monthly price.  Another thing that I like is the atmosphere, as another reviewer said it is not too commercial.  It feels non-judgemental and \"normal\".  A lot of the people who work there are really nice, especially Ellie, Carl, and Sam.\n                                Now onto why I chose 2 stars, instead of 3.  On any other day I probably would have chosen 3, but right now I am very upset at their spin class policy.  Because their spinning classes fill up so quickly, they have recently instituted a call list system in which you must call and reserve your spot in class.  On Friday I called at 3:30 to reserve my spot in the 5:30 class.  I was told I called too early and to call back later.  I called back at 4:14 and was told the class was full, oh well.  Tonight I had planned on going to the 6:30 spin class.  I called at 5:03 and was told the class was full up and that I could not attend.  I asked them how it was possible that in 2 and 1/2 - 3 minutes 20+ people had called and reserved spots.  The girl on the phone told me that there are three phones and three people answering them and that 6-7 people on each line had beaten me to it.  Then she told me I could go to Zumba instead if I wanted.  No thanks.\n                                       That annoyance aside, spin class is usually great.  Carl and Ellie are my favorite spin teachers, as they are both fun and challenging.  Ellie is really the best thing that gym has going for it.  Not only is she a great spinning instructor, she holds other classes, like \"Sweat, Tone, Sculpt\", which is a combo of aerobics and light weight training.  She puts 100% into every workout and doesn't allow anyone to slack.  She is the best fitness teacher I have ever encountered, anywhere.  If it weren't for her classes I might have just told the gym to take their spin classes and their 29.99 a month and shove it up their toned asses.\n              Clearly I do it for the classes.  That being said, I'm not an expert on the quality of the weight lifting machines.  They seem pretty normal to me and are never very crowded.  The treadmills, eliptical machines, and bikes are not many in number.  If you are someone who prefers to run on the treadmill but can only get to the gym after a 9-5 job, this is very challenging.

City Fitness overall as a gym is great.

The people who complain in reviews about not being able to bring guests obviously did not review the membership options: if you choose the cheaper membership ($40/month) you do not get free guest passes or unlimited classes. When City Fit signs you up for a membership, they have someone sit down with you to review the contract options and go over everything very thoroughly.

My favorites are spin and body pump. They are always full and have a waitlist soon after sign up opens.

I should have walked right away!\n\nSo the deal at the time was $99 to sign up and $59.99 a month thereafter.  I am an avid reader of contracts, and I pointed out the many loopholes to them before signing it.  I was assured it was a very casual contract, they were a neighborhood business, and they weren't going to screw anyone over.  What a convincing little song and dance.  Well, I believe in giving people (especially neighbors, and so called \"neighborhood businesses\") the benefit of the doubt, so I signed up because they were conveniently located and had yoga classes.  And for 6 months, I happily went to my yoga classes and paid my bills.  \n\n...Until one day I come in and find out it's going to cost an additional $10 a month (in the middle of my contract!!) to continue to attend those yoga classes.  Pretty shady, right?  Whatev.  Since they bailed on their own contract, all I want is a refund of the initiation fee, and a refund of the last 39 days I'd prepaid upon signing up back in December.  They've decided to ignore that request.  The excuses they've given me on the phone are piss-poor, and one member of their staff even got verbally abusive on the phone.  \n\nI highly recommend you check out the neighborhood message board, northernliberties.org, before considering a membership here.

There are a lot of excellent things about this gym, and there are a lot of things that leave a foul taste in your mouth.  Here's the short list: \n\nThe good: \n- Many of the yoga teachers, including Lisa, Kelly and Mark, are fabulous and I miss them.  \n- The TVs & vents atop each aerobic machine are nice \n- The overall gym vibe is nice, full of neighbors, not meatheady\n\nThe bad: \n- The gym has some cleanliness issues.  Yes it is new so it looks new, but get close up to a yoga mat: they don't get scrubbed down and you can smell an interesting, unique sweat bouquet on each one.  Dust bunnies float about like tumbleweed, too.  The bathrooms are often out of toilet paper and I used a shower once and told myself never again, ew.  A professional cleaning company really needs to be hired here.  \n- When machines break, they should be fixed promptly.  Some of the treadmills were very shaky.  Some of the TVs and air vents don't work. \n- The nickel-and-diming across the board is very annoying.  How about providing towels for the prices we are paying?  Or the full shampoo/soap/conditioner range in the showers?

I was confused... was my 20 minute speech not clear enough for them to mention this? Were my cries not enough to be told about this option? I spoke to three different people that night - neither said a word.\n\nOh well, I filled out the form, and jogged my way back the next day.

I saw their website and was like \"wow this place looks awesome and its right down the street from me\". For I didn't know a simple thing as a gym membership would stress me out for months to come.\n\nI would like to say also I do not wish harm to this gym, I hope it does succeed and this is my honest review. I hope these reviews help the owner or whomever to realize and improve their businesses ways. For me, my bad experience was customer service and billing. 1st of all NO ONE joining a gym wants to get stuck in contracts. People have stress in their everyday life and when getting done work, going to the gym should be worry free and stress free. They have to worry about real bills and real stress with everyday life, no one should have to stress over a gym contract. They want to simply pay monthly and when they want to leave they're able to leave. This gym randomly charges you $100, after 90 days as a lock in fee? Then they charge another $100 to cancel since I made poor choice of signing up for a year, which I did expect to stay for a full year. I actually did recommend a friend to this gym when I was in my 1st month and I was suppose to get a free month after that but somehow I never got that free month and was still being billed regularly. I contacted them, make long story short and gave up after awhile cause it was just ridiculous.\n\nGoing in I was told when you sign up you have 30 days to complete this list of things and if you do you get $5 off your membership every month. I told the girl, \"I'm actually going away for a week in 2 days, and would it be better if I signed up when I come back, so that when I get back from being away I can actually get everything done on the checklist and have the correct amount of time I'm suppose to have? She said \"no need, I'll make a note so that we don't start your membership till when you come back.\" So I sign up, go away for a week, come back and within that month from my start date I completed everything on my checklist. When bringing my card in I was told I was a few days past and they wouldn't give me the lower $5 rate. I told them what happened and that the one girl said it would be fine and explained the story to them and they told me \"no, she wasn't suppose to do that and I'm sorry but you cant have the discounted rate.\" So off the bat I'm already furious with this gym. \n\nI couldn't imagine those who paid for a trainer, thats another locked in contract, which when I took the free class (on the checklist) I kind of felt forced to sign up, but I didn't, thank God. Talk about pushy. The guy told me the entire time \"don't think about your finances, we'll handle it and make it work... blah blah blah. He asked me if \"finances did not matter would you sign up?\" I said \"of course, I would.\" Then he asked me how much I'd be willing to pay. I told him and he basically went on about how I could pay what they wanted and how I could cut my living cost so I could pay it. In my head I'm like is this guy serious? I just wanted to get out of there by then and they had me still fill out this paper work asking me my fitness goals and just being really pushy trying to get me to sign up. I knew when walking out of that trainer session that something was wrong with this gym.\n\nPeople want a gym that cares about its customers and not about locking them into contracts and sucking their money dry. Thats why I joined another gym cause this gym stinks. They need to get rid of fees for people who want to leave and their 90 day \"lock in\" fee. Plus get it together and teach your employees what good customer service is. Stop being pushy and make people feel welcomed and comfortable.", "date": "2017-05-15 22:18:47"}, {"_key": "874913", "_id": "reviews/874913", "_rev": "_fNysaA---Y", "review_id": "14tIN7JLohe0Dj-E0L-Mtw", "user_id": "s8fKaugDDW5VxAJUtOwo4A", "business_id": "Tm3QiAVLJAR2fEJK7APPPQ", "stars": 2, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I give an average score because lack of group classes and the Thrive classes.

My first encounter with having a problem was when my credit card information was stolen and had to close my credit card and I explained this to abc financial and the Crunch gym, that I would give them my new card information as soon as I received a new card. Every day that I had to check in for a class, they informed me I was behind on my payment (25.00!!) at the front desk in front of customers. Mind you they already had me account flagged in their computer and they said they would refrain from asking me anything until I received my new card. This happened every single time I went. My next issue with them was when I had to stop attending the gym because my daughter was unexpectedly deployed and now I was the primary care giver for my 3 year old grandson. I could not attend the gym due to my commute to work in New Brunswick every day and now the added responsibility of providing care to my grandson by taking him to and from daycare. I called several times and explained this to Crunch and their main concern was just getting money and not the concern that I had to raise a 3 year old until my daughter returns from duty in November. Then I could not due anything over the phone I had to physically come into the gym, which I had no time to do, or send a certified letter. While I was deciding to do this I was being charged from January up until June. I finally was able to take a day off from work with no pay and go into the gym and cancel my membership. Before I went to the gym to cancel I paid close to 160.00 (for a membership I didn't get to use), to make good on my contract with the gym. When the manager was about to process my termination papers, she had the audacity to ask my why I was canceling... I explained to her my situation, then she had the nerve to say that I had to pay an additional $25.00 for the month of July because in another 10 days I would be billed again! I will never and I mean never obtain another Crunch membership again under any circumstances! The manager was very rude, lacked compassion and basically made it seem like somehow I had the problem. I  am very disappointed with this money hungry gym and their lack of compassion that they distribute to people and their family members that are affected by individuals who are serving our country. My daughter's deployment was not planned, me being an alternative full time parent until my daughter returns, was not planned.....Crunch Fitness needs to be ashamed of themselves and how they treat their customers and households who are affected by family members serving our country.

And as for group fitness being nonexistent, I have been to three yoga classes there and my friend goes every week. As for managerial presence, no I don't see what I presume to be owners there frequently, but during staffer hours I have always been welcomed with a nice hello and wave- most people, I think, don't want much more when they are in their workout/zen mode. One thing to consider with staffing is that it is a 24 hour gym and there are STAFFED hours... I hate to be argumentative but I dislike seeing unfair reviews; there is only so much that a business can help. \n\nThat being said, my review is not a rave. This gym is one thing, adequate. The facility is small, so no there is not much equipment. Also, there are two shower rooms and a unisex restroom.

This place is huge with lots of parking, but I imagine it can be packed on weekends. IncrediPlex has a lot of variety of activities. Our experience was during a holiday off from school and with the games and blow up things. The kids can play on the blow up things for $6 Mon-Thur and I believe a dollar or two more Fri-Sun. For kids 2 and under, it's free. And for a good reason. \n\nThe kids I take care of are 2 and 5, even though the 2 year old tried the monkey slide a couple of times, she didn't like it much afterwards. Plus she's on the small size, so it's a bit of an extra challenge for her. It was great for her brother, I think overall I'd recommend this for ages 4 and up.\n\nSince we went on a Monday, they had a special with the game card. Put $10 on the card and they'll match it. And they don't charge you for the card either. The games were in a range of prices from I believe $.50 to $1.50, maybe $2.. I like that they list how much a game costs at the game and how much you have left on your card after you swipe it to play a game. I feel like it's easier to keep track of compared to Dave & Buster's. With the card you can play the video/arcade games, I feel like you can use the card to do the bungee jumper and the climbing wall. I think the laser tag is apart of that, but I can't recall. So those might be a little bit more than the other games, but not bad. Plus you win tickets and there's a machine to collect and count your ticket amount and put it on the card so you can get the usual toy fair.\n\nThere's also a bowling area near the games with at least half a dozen bowling lanes. Also a snack concession and an adults bar area. There are multiple tables to sit and eat, as well as numerous leather chairs and couches to sit and watch your kids play. And there's wifi, you just have to ask for the password as it's protected. This place is also geared for birthday parties.\n\nAdditionally, IncrediPlex has turf fields, hardwood courts, sport court, modified baseball/softball diamond. Plus there's an indoor fitness center.

Unfortunately that's what happened today.\n\nI brought the kids I care for there today. The parking lot wasn't busy, so I thought that would be good. What I didn't realize is that they have a camp there with various kids I'd guess between 8-13. At first we saw a half dozen kids on the court playing basketball with a camp counselor. \n\nWhere the problem came in was that the \"flotation\" area was swarmed with about 15-20 additional kids just running all over that area, acting poorly, and being chaotic. Yes there were two camp counselors \"overseeing\" these kids, meaning they were either sitting on the sofas or standing around. Not telling the kids they weren't behaving appropriately or stop running up the slides and jumping on the outside area of the safari one.\n\nIt just wasn't fair that they were behaving so terrible and there was no one acknowledging that. The counselors shirts said Incredi-plex, but there wasn't other employees keeping an eye out for the other people not with the camp. It was a free for all.\n\nAfter that they bombarded the obstacle course and finally it was time for them to have lunch and they picked up their shoes that had been thrown about. It gave my kids a chance to play, but shortly after that we had to go.\n\nIt was all so frustrating, and after seeing the lack of supervision and the chaos, I don't have any desire to return there.", "date": "2013-07-02 23:01:39"}, {"_key": "755525", "_id": "reviews/755525", "_rev": "_fNysWMO--j", "review_id": "GwOqFdE_fDhGR0Tq3JVKSg", "user_id": "2iS1vg5TYpV_iEiNC8osTg", "business_id": "kxvOUehCtJAL2nYKkeiR-w", "stars": 4, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "This is a huge sports park just off of Pendleton Pike in Lawrence.

It was also blissfully devoid of people, which always helps one have a better time. \n\nThe second time we visited, our visit wasn't as good. Their system was down, so we couldn't play any of the games, nor buy any food with anything but cash. (But who carries cash anymore? Not us, which meant we couldn't get any food.)\n\nBut despite the lackluster second visit, I'm still giving this place four stars because, to mangle the Henry Wadsworth Longfellow poem: When it is good, it is very, very good. This is a great place to take kids. They will have a good time.\n\nOne of the things that I like about Incrediplex is that they offer specials during the week. On certain days, you can get two-for-one wristbands, which allow kids to play in the bouncy house/maze area as much as they want. They also have a deal on certain days where they will match whatever you put on your game card, which you must use if you want to play any of the games or do any of the other attractions. (So if you put $20 on your game card, they'll add $20, so you'll have a total of $40 to play with.) \n\nAlso, they serve beer and wine! Hooray! Their food isn't too bad, either.

No thanks. And in the day it's not much better. So, the only reason I have gone there is for my daughter's volleyball tournaments. What I LOVE about going to Incrediblex as opposed to the other places that have hosted the tournaments is that they give you a players card worth the amount of your admission fee, $5. The place is really ginormous, soccer, basketball, batting cages, and all this is happening all at once, under one roof! They even have a full service restaurant. No, you can't order a steak and there's no waitress to serve your table, it's deli style ordering with a cute area of umbrella'd tables where you can eat everything from wings to sandwiches. Or, you can sit at the bar and partake in some wine and beer and although this is the only area designated 21 and over, you can drink outside of there as well. I saw dad's with beers in another table area watching sports. And I find it ask kind of funny. Yes, please serve parents alcohol while they watch their kids sporting events then have them drive home, lol! (And I am oneif thoseparents who partook becauae sometime a nice cold beer is just what an all-day volleyball tournament required. But, in all seriousness, no, I think the alcohol and food stuffs is about drawing in the Dave and Busters type of market without the D&B type of price. Unfortunately, they don't have the gaming and high end bar feel the other establishment can brag about;  BUT they have a lot more variety. They have bowling, inflatables, Lazer tag, and when the courts aren't being used the kids and I hopped on a court and played pepper (meaning you can just free-play between games). From what I understand they also have a gym? And open gym for the kids. \n**My only worry was having my teen daughter dropped off for open gym at a place that serves alcohol and has sooooo much to offer. It's a great place.  But as a mom, she likes to go and well the freedom to loiter and wander (20-ish age guys have been \"recruiting\" and now \"befriended\" my 16 year old daughter and her friends for open gym nights) worries me.**\n So, I'm a fan, wish it was closer, think some things might need to be reworked to keep bad situations like young girls being preyed on (precautionary), parking is more than sufficient (if you keep driving past the entrance you'll see that there's a whole lot behind the building (and the exit is one way so you have go that way to leave anyway),and I like how you can roam around watching and even just hanging around until the next game uncorralled (still love that part). As for the staff, tourney and restaurant staff have been courteous and seem to run things smoothly and they're usually busy.  To sum it up, my biggest beef with Incrediblex is its locale,  but, from what I've seen the patrons don't reflect the location, once you're inside you could be anywhere USA. So, would I recommend it?

My kiddo seems happy there and she just started, so maybe that's all that really matters. However, there are a some pros and a bazillion and one cons...\n\nFOR THE DAYCARE:\nPROS:\n- You, the parent, can easily drop off the kid and go for a work out. They're group classes seem to be timed to be just after school starts so it is convenient\n- Staff seem to be flexible with your needs if within their restricted hours.\n- Entire JCC is enclosed so at least you know when your child is running outside, there is minimal traffic and no strangers wandering about\n- Your child's tuition covers the cost of gym membership for you and spouse\n\nCONS:\n- Lunches are supposed to be nut free AND meat free\n- Lots of school closures for both christian and jewish days off\n- Lots of random rules (ex. if your child is wearing a skirt on gym day, forget it. She will be sitting on the sidelines)\n- Classes are not anywhere close to racially diverse. AT ALL. \n- Restricted hours: for any household with two working adults, you will have to deal with a 9a to 3:30p day care schedule with an \"early care\" option starting at 8am. This is pretty unbelievable considering the car traffic around here. \n\n\nFOR THE GYM:\nPROS:\n- As above, the link with the daycare seems to be the best reason to use this place\n- Sauna (but it is co-ed)\n- Several group classes offered\n\nCONS:\n- Everything is outdated even though they apparently just renovated the bathrooms. \n- Kiddie pool is kind of a joke... it's just a shallow outdoor pool that is covered with a thin film of dead flies and leaves\n- No towel service\n- The place reminds me of a YMCA ... from the 1960s. \n\n\nOverall though, I'm still using this place primarily due to location convenience and the ease of working out. I don't require a lot in a gym other than just needing the machines to work so this is fine enough for me.

Although not a member, I had visited the Spring Valley Y on a few occasions. It is almost identical to the Ambler location. We moved here and joined the Y after a tour and discussing the cost and the fact they were in the process of building a pool outside (like Spring Valley). Although the cost for Ambler is about $8-10 more a month than Spring Valley, we justified it with the difference in childcare cost. At Ambler, it's included in your membership, but at Spring Valley you pay $1/hour. Being pregnant with my second child, I figured Ambler worked out to be a better deal. \n\nThese are the reasons I'm rating this beautiful facility with 2 stars:\n\nI recently received an email stating pool memberships are now available for purchase. WHAT???? They are charging the members (who already pay top dollar for their membership) $400 to use the outdoor pool. $800 for non- members. This was not conveyed to us at the time we enrolled.\n\nThe children's classes are almost impossible to get into. I've been a member for almost a year and my daughter has gotten into swim lessons twice, but the first time, we had to go to Abington because Ambler was full. I try enrolling her first thing in the morning on the day enrollment starts, but most classes for 3 year olds are usually already full.\n\nI enrolled my daughter online for camp this year. I paid $50 for a deposit and the remainder was supposed to come out at a later date. We had a change of plans, so I called to cancel camp and they said I had to come in to fill out a form. I went in and they said I would lose the $50 deposit. I asked if they could put it towards a class or swim lessons and they said \"no.\" REALLY???\n\nThe place is gorgeous and new, but next to impossible to work out in the mornings when my daughter is in preschool. It's packed. I haven't tried going any other time because my schedule doesn't allow.\n\nOn a good note, the dance teacher, Dana, and the swim instructor, Caitlyn, are awesome with the kids. They seem to genuinely like what they do. Too bad it's so hard to get into classes with them.

Apparently \"Some restrictions apply\" means they do not actually have to honor the full promotion.  Their only reason for not honoring the deal was that supposedly part of the promotion applied to their Cathedral Oaks location and part of the promotion applied the Santa Barbara location.  There is no mention of this distinction on their promotion but I suppose that is how a bate and switch works.  When I presented my screenshot and demanded that the promotion be honored in early January the promotion was immediately pulled from their website.\n\nI understand that people can make mistakes.  A web designer can make a typo, a sales person can speak incorrectly or a business can misjudge the potential response to a promotion.  What I don't understand is why absolutely no concession is being made and when I question the ethics of their behavior I am laughed at.  Beth in membership actually laughed at me today on the phone!  She asked whether I seriously thought that I could pay no dues for 6 months and join their club for 75% of the signup fee.  Yes, Beth, when your promotion of which I have a screenshot advertises such I very much expect you to honor it.\n\nHow much would it really cost them to honor their promotion?  How much would they stand to gain by having an additional member after the promotional 6 months had passed?\n\nTo make things worse this is the second time I have fallen victim to their poor business ethics.  In mid-2011, I spoke with John Youngblood at SBAC about signing up my fiance and he offered a discounted sign-up fee yet when we returned the following week John Youngblood was no longer there and the price was not honored.

I was a member from 1998 to 2015. I see some of the negative reviews are older. Others just have no standard of comparison, clearly. Free coffee and cream, for instance, you will never find at Equinox. I miss the old cafe of course (and bar); in the 1990s, I ate here more than anywhere else in town. \n\nSince I left, they put a million at least into the locker rooms. Indoor was always a smaller room (with an oddly large dry sauna). And hallelujah! The boys and girls switched. Our locker room (\"outdoor\") was so much smaller than the guys' room. They also had a bigger steam room. \n\nIt's just beautiful. Same lockers as Equinox (no more padlocks, woohoo). The flooring is fantastic. \n\nAlso, thankfully, someone decide that the orange in the weight room adjacent to the locker rooms was a bad idea. Some orange remains in the boot camp room but it's fine. \n\nCardio upstairs is SO much brighter.  I remember when that room was a cave. \n\nThe treadmills are by the left-most squash court. Star Trac is a brand of treadmill with which I am unfamiliar. I'm a fan. They even have one of those treadmills for marathoners. Woodbine or something. I'm not a fan but the variety is excellent. \n\nSince I joined on New Year's Eve, I've never seen over 15 people at the club. The whole club! \n\nI know some people are sad that classes were closed but they're open now in a tent by the parking lot. I never took classes so it doesn't matter to me. \n\nI also am baffled by the complaints about price. At 159/month, it's less than the Bay Club (LA/SF) and wayyyy lower than Equinox. The same cleaning people are there (plus some new ones) and no one could possibly say anything negative about these lovely humans. \n\nThe managers and desk people are all new since I left. Terrific youngsters at the desk. They removed the Power Plate (a drag) and one girl at the desk was quite indifferent/unable to answer questions. Big deal. I don't need every person at a business to be perfect. \n\nThe pool is wonderful.  Best pool in America I've swum. The view of the lemon trees and the trees over the parking lot feel like home to me. I cannot begin to guess how many miles I've logged in this pool. Only when you move to NYC do you really appreciate the length of this pool. I think it's 68 lengths to a mile (about 5 alternate side strokes). So nice not to have to turn around constantly. Jacuzzi jets work---always. \n\nThere are no towels right now. That's a drag but you get used to it. (The Bay Club has towels so this is not a Newsom issue.) Steam and sauna closed but everything else open, indoors and out. \n\nI think SB people just don't know how good they have it. When you move to New York you really do appreciate just how excellent a club this is. And it used to be more country bumpkin. It's quite sleek now .\n\nCody is a terrific personal trainer (who started at Williamsburg Equinox). I got a free session when I joined. The initiation was just $199 at Xmastime. \n\nThe 1 star review is absurd and should be removed. It's a club. Of course you have to be a member. \n\nI joined for 12 months (to get the $159 rate). Originally I had intended to be here 9 months and it worked out about the same for the contract and non-contract. \n\nBut I was expecting the club dues to have jumped at least to $199, so I was overjoyed to find out that even after all the money to renovate the locker rooms, the rates stayed where they were. \n\nAlso, while LA clubs were closed, SBAC was open. They deserve ALL the gratitude in the world for this. Again, Santa Barbarans just don't know how good they have it in the gym department. New York opened gyms 9/2 but LA has been closed except for gyms with outdoor space. \n\nI love this club. The minute I walked into the locker room, I smelled the familiar scent of cleaner.

This is a standard practice even in most bargain gyms.) \n- Improve customer service, starting with...a smile. It's easy, watch :) There are a couple of good staff but the majority of the folks behind the front desk spend their time talking to one another, (sometimes whilst folding towels) while guests are waiting patiently to speak with them. \n- Train staff to monitor supplies and keep them stocked. Almost daily, if I want to utilize a complimentary water cup or grab tea/coffee, there is always something out of stock. Be it a cup but no lids, straws but no cups, cups but no coffee, or some confluence of the above. (This will prevent guests from having to go back downstairs and interrupt your gossip/flirting sessions happening behind the front desk in order to ask for those items to be replenished.) \n\nIn terms of renovations, I'd love to see the ladies' showers improved. The water pressure trickles out and halts when someone flushes the toilet, hooks instead of rings, add a fixture in the shower for folks to set their razor, shampoo, etc if they bring their own toiletries, an opaque shower wall would be nice. (I don't need to see the woman in the stall next to me scrubbing her ass crack and I'd rather not be on display to her as I scrub mine). Replace the flimsy shower curtains with heavy duty curtains that don't blow and stick to ones' body. Invest in quality, standard towels (or better) and get rid of the tiny, brittle towels currently offered. Guests will use less towels if they are larger and more absorbent. \n\nNow for some positive attributes. This is a club for all ages. It does not matter if you're 19 or 119 years old, you will have peers at SBAC doing fitness things throughout the facilities. You can feel comfortable joining with the entire family, your teens, your parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, or even your great-great grandparents. No will feel out of place. It's truly a club for all ages. \n\nA few pro-tips: \n- Ladies, lift weights! Diversify your workout for optimal results. Ignore the chauvinists in the weight room who think building male muscle is more important than a woman building hers. (Beware you may find yourself replying, \"Yes, I am using this equipment that is in my hands.\")\n- Bring headphones with ample volume for the cardio room UNLESS you want to be serenaded by a woman who likes to go to the treadmill closest to mirrors and sing loudly for all to hear as she makes faces to herself in the mirror while walking on the treadmill. \n- Don't be alarmed if you open the door to the sauna in the locker room and discover a member of the staff, fully clothed in their uniform sipping a Big Gulp and playing on their phone in the dark. I guess there are not many places for unenthusiastic employees to hideout on the clock.\n\nAnd if you're ever looking for a what a five star experience at an athletic club is supposed to feel like, go visit FIT Athletic Club in Downtown San Diego. It's the best club I've ever belonged to.

As far as gyms go this one ranks up there with the nicer ones. Nothing to special. They have the usual suspects as far as patrons and equipment goes. \n\nSay what?! I was an easy sale. Not going to lie, I wanted a gym close to me this LA happened to be a gym close to me. Hardly a match made in heaven but it was a match none the less. Looking like an easy sale did not stop Derrick from giving me his all and it's really presentation that blows me away. So the kids got to hang out in the Kids Klub and I got to tour and sign up. I got a lot of great advice along the way from Derrick. Sign up was a breeze, price was just right. We got some Kids Klub action, some personal training action. We we set! \n\nLittle in the middle but she got much back. I'm a bit of a curvy girl ... ok so I have some serious curve in the hip. I don't feel judged. I feel judged A LOT elsewhere in life. Here, nope. No one cares, they are doin their own thing. I like it. So we have a personal trainer, a master personal trainer even, who is just great! Mason works on more than just the repetitive movement, he really breaks it down to the basics and helps you with proper movement. The best thing about him is he is so encouraging and not in the boot campy, harsh or angry way. I really feel true commitment to not wanting to disappoint him. Don't tell my husband (who trains with me) but seeing Mason is the highlight of my week. I kid, I kid. We have found true pleasure in exercising together. \n\nMOMS AND DADS ... Kids Klub. Wow. The people in there are so awesome. I'm not a fan of leaving my kids with strangers. These guys don't stay strangers for long and each one of them are so awesome with the kiddos. Secure. Yes. Secure.

Please don't confuse a lack of complaints with improvement of the situation. \n\nFor example, for years we have asked for more cooling in the spin room and have been told an additional fan was about to be installed. Never happened. Same with the room used for yoga. We were actually told the room would be cooled for \"actual exercise\" classes. We were also told that each instructor was asked and said the temperature was perfect. Odd that each instructor has asked us to complain to management about the heat- it's very stuffy always and uncomfortably hot most of the year. Members have requested better cooling all the way up to corporate. \n\nAlso, we have asked repeatedly if while yoga is in session, racquetball players could be asked to use a court other than the one that shares a common wall with the yoga room- assuming one is available. We have been told that is not a fair request to make to those members. None have ever objected the move when we ask so how hard could it be to post a sign on the door during yoga classes or assign a different court? \n\nThere are lots of classes offered and the yoga and spin classes I take are great.

And then If he lost 80lbs with them then he can get his money back. A majority of the people come to the camp because they are over weight. Putting them down and making them feel that unless they lose 80lbs that it's not a transformation and how 20lbs is nothing compared to 280lbs is not how you gain loyal clients or even a new client. I'm sorry but that is very misleading and not how other camps work. She proceeded to say how it's just a marketing scheme to get people to become members (who says that?!). It hurts me that they would say that to my own brother when I'm here trying to get everyone I know healthy and introducing them to this gym. I called myself and Shareen answered; she was very pushy and rude. I called myself to get some basic info to see how she really was and turns out she's worse then he described. I'm a member at the camp on the west coast and have referred a lot of people that purchased memberships and completed challenges. At that location everyone is friendly and sensitive when it comes to someone's weight. Sadly, I re-told all my family and friends not to go there bc I don't appreciate how they treat people and don't want anymore of them getting disrespected and put down. A few of them found a similar program at a cross fit and are happy and comfortable there.

I'm definintely a fan!\n\nBefore trying it today, I was sure I was going to come to Yelp to give Body Cycle 5 stars after the first time because my favorite instructor (Robbie) from the Bellevue teaches classes here. I've even taken Russell at the Bellevue a few times over the 5 years that I belonged (though not regulary because when I was a member his classes were too early for me). I even took one class with Shoshana when I was there and she teaches here too. I remember her being really good (I over-analyze instructors that I'm new to). So with that said, I was already impressed with some of the instructors before even stepping foot into this place.\n\nWhen I did step foot, I was impressed with the simple layout. I liked the exposed brick too. It was a simple sign up process and when I got there all I had to do was initial my name. I was greeted by Kerry, the instructor, who was friendly and answered all of my questions. I wasn't familiar with the type of bike that Body Cycle uses but someone from my good ole' old gym was there and helped me out with that. Once Kerry got started he also gave the newbies the rundown on how to use the bike.\n\nThe reason for the 4 stars is because I wasn't that impressed with the class. I was expecting a livelier, more intense class. It wasn't a bad class at all. I just wanted my ass kicked. Usually, when I take 90-minute spin classes, I'm ready to go after about 60 minutes and I have to really push myself to keep going. I had to leave a little early today for an appointment, but I could've easily kept going without a push. \n\nI'm going to definitely come back on the weekends that I'm in Philly. I need to work out while here and since you pay per class, it makes sense. I am familiar with some of the instructors, so I know I can come here and get my ass kicked. \n\nFinally, there is one shower here. It isn't advertised probably because there's only one. It's nice and clean and comfortable. I had to use it today because I had another appointment immediately after.I wouldn't rely on it though because, again, there's only one. \n\nFirst class is free.

Here's the rundown:\n\nStudio- small (one room of bikes), but plenty of space to cubby your schtuff, use the restroom, and hang out when you are waiting before class. \n\nBike room-  space and bikes are close. Stadium style and everyone can see instructor. Everyone can also see themself in mirror whether from front or side. \n\nBathroom- has one shower and some toiletries accessible to guests. \n\nNoise- yes, classes are REALLY LOUD, but come on...have you ever taken a spin class before? You need this loud 'pump-me-up' music to get through a gruesome workout! And if you can't tolerate loud, they offer you ear plugs!!\n\nThe bikes- really nice. Awesome speedometer and definitely quality\n\nThe instructors- so far so good. They spend a lot of time helping people before class to make sure seat height is correct, etc. I overheard Tiffany speaking to a couple last night who had just finished their first spin class and she was giving them lots of helpful tips! Really nice girl. Jessica gave me a good instructional about bikes before my first class there because I had never worked with that brand of bike before. \n\nMusic- each instructor has their own playlist, but so far it has been a techno/rap blend that definitely gets your butt moving\n\nClass times- ok considering they have one room\n\nLocation- center city, safe block!\n\nOverall, highly recommended. I wish Classpass would let me attend this studio more then 3 times per month! \nI would consider buying a full time membership here if I had the money!\n\nAddendum: took a second class with Jessica this week.

He was great - the class was full but he did a really good job of checking peoples monitors during the class to see how we were doing, and answering any questions that people had. The website says that hes a very experienced triathlete and ultra marathon runner (!) and after the class I felt that I'd really learned a lot (we did several hill climbs using different gears, to see how our power output compared for each) and had a really great workout. The temperature was good - cool for a spin studio, and he picked good music.  \n\nA few small things meant that I didn't give the place a 5, one is that its really small (including the lobby area and the actual studio) and some of the bikes face other people in the class which can be a little offputting.

The bikes do have really good displays on them - syncs with a heart rate monitor, shows watts, calories, rpm etc, but I did find it slightly strange that there are numbered gears on the bikes rather than the dial that you tend to get on spin bikes that lets you gradually add resistance.

The maturity level of Shoshanna, the manager, is non-existent.  Some of the teaches there are not great, and I've mentioned that.

He doesn't blast the music and gives instructions you can follow.  He also doesn't make you jump up and down on the bike (not my preference) and do silly claps. I find dance-type style annoying.  Others may like it.  It slowed down the calorie burn in my opinion, and I've been teaching dance and Pilates for 20+ years.\n\nAlso, the classes aren't hard but are okay for only beginners.

There are plenty of pros about this signature gym, especially compared to other options around South Tampa. I go at various times and I have never had to wait for a machine, although the free weights upstairs do tend to get very busy and you will be waiting at peak hours. The pool and hot tub are always clean and I love how the lanes are set up for splits (two people can do laps in same lane), the sauna could be much hotter (avg. is 162 and it needs to be about 170), but it's always clean, and the showers/locker rooms (for guys anyway) are again, always clean. I've never had my stuff moved or my locker opened or anything stolen and I consider this a plus and they have a TV for every locker row which I appreciate. The scheduling of classes seems to hit the majority of work schedules and I have taken over 20 spin classes and like everything, some of the instructors are good and some are better. They even play the background music pretty low (except for those loud, obnoxious sales days where the group fitness companies get to come in), the food and drinks at the smoothie bar are good and the service there is always friendly. \nI do have a couple of cons though: the parking is frustrating! Tight, and if you go during peak hours be prepared to wait in a long line, come close to getting clipped around corners from juiced up necks in their beer-bro trucks, and I've almost hit a few pedestrians in that garage myself. It's craziness during the peak hours! They need to wipe down the racquetball courts more often - they are more slippery than other courts and that's an ankle injury waiting to happen. My biggest gripe is the staff at the front desk, and even a few trainers. The front desk are simply clueless. I was told recently that I couldn't schedule a racquetball court less than 8 days ahead of time (this was wrong), it took 20 minutes to get a receipt for a league I was signing up for, they seem to play on their phones instead of watch for the herds of people coming in to check in, and just last weekend I was dropping off a cancellation form for a friend and the desk girl said they simply wouldn't take it, wouldn't even drop it in the mail for me, I had to mail it myself to the California office (it says right on the form to drop it off at any club). They are almost useless. Over by the trainer area the trainers have their clients running almost full speed up and down the elliptical and treadmill rows and that is ridiculously unsafe and I can't believe they allow it. The TV's on the cardio machines are hit and miss and there's no way to tell what is going to work or not until your set up and running already. It's a big place though with plenty of space and equipment to do your thing without any hassles in the least.

The weight area is upstairs and is quite vast, with all the machines and free weights you can think of.\n\nSo all of this is pretty much expected for a signature location; so here's what I like the place:\n\n1) The Staff has been very friendly and receptive to comments. Usually I make them on my way out, so I can't say if they follow up immediately, but they don't give me a haughty look when I say something... you'd be surprised how often this occurs.\n\n2) The locker rooms are decently kept.  There's always someone that leaves something out, but I haven't been scared to go in and change in there... \n\n3) The pool is also kept in good conditions. You'd be surprised how often I've jumped into a pool and the water is cloudy... yeah not good.\n\n4) Parking seems to be pretty decent; now keep in mind, I usually come midday and am always able to grab ground floors spot.

I \"get\" the lunk alarm and what it represents but what I don't get is how prematurely pushing the \"lunk alarm\" to warn of disapproved behavior does not make people in the gym feel even more uncomfortable and awkward.  I was in the free weight section and had a dumbbell standing tall on its side.  I went to shift it and fell to its side creating a mild thump.  And when I say mild, I mean mild.  A 25lb weight falling on its side from a floor position accidentally did not justify creating an even bigger scene by pushing the lunk alarm.  I almost would have been embarrassed except I was so obviously not demonstrating inappropriate behavior that I didn't care, nor did I think anyone thought it was from me.  Quite simply, the noise should have been perhaps noted and observed, but it was clearly an accident (a mild one at that) and not a representation of intimidating behavior.  If it repeated again and again...that is another story.

They all seem really into it, have a lot of energy, and make sure you're really pushing yourself as best you can.

The playlists they use are also basically the best workout music ever -- great upbeat mixes of both current and classic pop songs, that also always change every class.\n\nToneZone is also extremely clean, has great new equipment, and is always a comfortable workout temperature with AC at high 60s (which is very important when it's over 90 out).

My wife and I have had countless gym memberships, and we compete in powerlifting competitions, so I like to think we are good judges when it comes to gyms. This place is the best place in town, we also have memberships at Gold's, yet we choose to come here instead. The facility itself is always clean, even if its a little cluttered some times. But, there is plenty of equipment here from dumbbells from 2.5 lbs all the way up to 100 lbs. They have a couple of squat racks, and benches, and machines for practically every bodypart along with tons of cardio equipment. Every interaction we have had at this gym has been exceptional, whether its other members, or employees. We've made friends with members, and employees as well. There is every demographic being represented in this facility, there are older members who enjoy their social interactions, younger members who enjoy their social interaction, and others in-between who come in to get a workout and leave. The employees at this gym are all nice, courteous, and helpful. My wife and I will be moving again soon, and we are sad that we won't be using this facility anymore.

I even called a few times to get the purchase done and heard nothing.

Monday is lower body workout, Tuesday is upper body workout, Wednesday is cardio day, Thursday is lower body workout, Friday is upper body workout and Saturday is whatever the teacher wants to do.  They break up the workouts by always moving and changing things up so your body never gets used to 1 particular workout.  There are also 2 different groups.  There is a phase 1 and a phase 2 group.  Phase 1 does more modified workouts than phase 2 and you have your choice as to what group you would like to work out in.  Some days if I'm hung over, I'll do phase 1.  It's completely up to you.

The greeter greets me and is very friendly. I am then taken to a waiting area behind where all the sales vermin reside. As I'm sitting there, I actually heard Clinton tell his sales team and VP who happened to be there. \"You all ready to see how this is done?!\" Then Clinton comes around the corner and greets me with his VP who says his name is also Clint.  \n\nLong story short, I sit down at Clinton's desk and he says he's going to see what he can do and starts looking at his computer's screen like as if he doesn't already know what deals he can offer. I then tell him I'm only interested in the single club monthly rate with no initiation fee as I'm not going to pay one. He then abruptly gets up, shakes my hand and tells me that plan doesn't exist. \n\nAll this could've been avoided if the dude was just honest.

I believe the gym was remodeled a couple of years back, though it makes me wonder what the place looked like before. From what I heard, LA Fitness tends to clean the equipment often, compared to 24 Hour Fitness (not that any exist in Arizona). We see the staff cleaning the equipment, mirrors, and floor each evening. \n\nThe saunas are located in the restroom, showers have curtains and there is one handheld blow dryer is located towards the end of the locker room. It's not very glamorous compared to the university gym I've used in the past, but I guess it gets the job done. And there are free mini-lockers (where you enter in a code) located outside the locker room, if you need to store small things, like your wallet and keys.\n\nThey have a 4 lane pool and small hot tub. Sufficient treadmills and ellipticals, but I can't promise anything on Mondays --I'm not sure how everyone seems to gain the motivation to get to the gym at the beginning of the week. Then again, maybe it was because the nearest LA Fitness was under construction.\n\nThere are several racquet ball rooms (personally, I wished badminton or tennis was an option). The gym has one basketball court, another room for stretches, a cycling room and another for classes. There is a childcare area, I'm not sure about the specifics, but I believe it comes at an additional price. \n\nAs for the people at the gym, it's fairly diverse in regards to ethnicity, age, and physical fitness. There are classes like Zumba and aquatic aerobics. I would imagine the schedule is posted online. \n\nTHE STAFF\n\nThe bad: I am often wary about gyms as I am at car dealerships. My first experience here, 6 months prior, was with a stereotypical and superficial employee, trying to shove a gym membership down my throat, despite having stated multiple times that I only wanted to try the free trial for now and I wasn't ready to commit to a gym membership yet. \n\nAlternatively, the person who signed my brother up for a trial felt it was appropriate to show off a photo of himself with abs. Weird flex, but okay. I'm happy to say I think that both guys have moved on to a different facility. (:\n\nThe decent: The staff at the front will usually say \"hi\" or \"bye.\" I realized this doesn't always happen since half the time, people walk past without responding. I haven't had any extended interaction with them, but the staff seems pretty alright to me.\n\nThe good: Mike is a new-ish general manager and he's definitely your go-to guy, if you have any questions or concerns. Mike is the most personable gym manager I've met and I appreciated his small gestures of encouragement when I revealed my couch potato life. I've also seen gym members discussing concerns with Mike in a friendly manner, so it appears that he is approachable and does a good job resolving issues.\n\nSo after my 6-month hiatus fo the gym, I returned for another trial and was pleasantly surprised with Mike his genuine and respectful demeanor. When it was time to sign-up, he informed me of a deal that came up in February. It was truly a great option for someone who is committed to visit the gym consistently, which I can't say that I am.\n\nI want to commend Mike's integrity in providing an honest recommendation to help me determine which membership was the best fit (rather than his or the company's bottom line). I feel that the trust he developed is more than what money can buy.

I have been practicing yoga regularly for 5 years, Barre for 2 years, and have a personal trainer. I work hard in my classes and I know proper form so as to avoid injury.\nThis studio does NOT care about your form, about whether you're misaligned, about whether you hurt yourself. The moves and motions we were doing were made up and not based in any sort of classic fitness moves. Was this class a Barre class? No. Was it an aerobics class? No. Was it a HIIT class? No. What was happening was a synthesis of random choreography that the instructor pulled out of thin air. I came out of the class with neck pain that lasted almost a week. We were jumping around, over utilizing bands attached to the Barre, and not ONE person received hands on adjustments in a class of 6 women. Our moves weren't in sync with the music, she kept changing the songs, at one point her phone rang over the speaker. I felt like I was in the twilight zone. The owner/instructor said that she is opening another studio, I hope that's not the case. She also commented on being hung over, which was unprofessional. \n\nIt baffles me that this studio has such high ratings on Yelp. When I told fellow ClassPass goers that I took a class here they all had the same reaction: they tried it once and would never go back.\n\nThis is SUCH a shame because we have almost ZERO studios East of Broad street and I can walk to this place from my apartment in under 10 minutes.

I have been a member to other gyms which include:\n\nRetro fitness (Lumberton) which was a decent gym.\n\nLa Fitness (Mount Laurel) which I wasn't the biggest fan of. I just didn't like how big it was and the environment was one I personally didn't like for working out I didn't feel comfortable at this type of gym.\n\nSnap fitness (Hainesport) was the worst experience I ever had at a gym let alone with anywhere I have ever been a customer to. The owner Adele and her husband (who owns the Medford location) are very awful with customer service. I do not recommend ANYONE to this location and if you have been to this horrible location and didn't like your experience I highly recommend the Columbus location.\n\nThankfully I gave Columbus a try before totally nicking Snap Fitness as a whole. It was the best decision I made. I love working out but was struggling to find a location that I was comfortable with and fit around my schedule. Also most importantly a gym that had enough equipment but not an overwhelming amount. This gym is what i've been looking for in a gym and more. The first day I went there I was a little skeptical because Adele (Hainesport owner) was such a witch and I didn't want to deal with another person like her. I won't forget how welcoming these three brothers were from that very moment when my husband and I walked in the door. I was instantly relieved and happy with my decision to go there. They welcomed me an apologized for what that other location did. I was told I could go to any Snap Fitness but Adele lied her pricing is based on HER GYM ONLY. However, Dennis, Stephen and Mark honored what I signed up for; given the circumstances. Every time I walk into Columbus they welcome me and at the end of my work out they always make sure to say bye have a good night! These guys know how to treat customers. They take great care of the gym and always have the AC on. I've had many great work outs at this location. Peter is the personal trainer here. I have not had sessions with him but he has went out of his way to talk to me he's such a nice, friendly, outgoing person. When I was pregnant he came over to me to ask what I was having and what his name was going to be. He even saw me trying grab a weight at an awkward position and went out of his way to help me by handing me my weights in-between his training session. I was so thankful for his help!! This has happened on several occasions with him helping me reach for a weight or bar that was a little high for me or too far away from my reach.\n\nSnap Fitness Columbus gave me more motivation to want to work out which is the most important thing, finding a gym that motivates you to want to keep going not one that gives you an excuse not to go. I can't say enough what a great gym this is in every aspect. As a female I can say I am 100% comfortable here and my husband loves this gym too. Snap Fitness Columbus works for him and I which I can't say was the case for any gym prior to this one. I decided to finally write this review because even after my first visit, which was about 15 months ago, these men continue to be so kind and I want to express my gratitude. They put 100% into the gym. I hope people see this review and go to this location you will be happy and motivated! Sorry if any of this was repetitive or it dragged out but I did not want to miss out on anything and wanted to emphasize how great this gym truly is.

In March 2020 I decided to joint Crunch Fitness on Bloomingdale. Of everyone knows COVID happened shortly after. During the state wide shutdown I attempted to find a number to call crunch in order to cancel my membership because my wife is high risk. Of course there are no general contact number because the gym is franchised.  I tried contacting the gym during the closer and was unsuccessful. So, on Monday May 18, 2020 Gym's opened as well did crunch fitness. I called them at 0800 to cancel my account. They said in order to cancel I would have to go in person or send a certified letter.  So after work at 3pm I stopped by. I learned that as of that day everyone in crunch was charged $27 which was ok if I was going to use the gym. I talked to the AM and explained that I won't be using the gym at all because of my wife's status and asked if I could be refunded my money because of COVID. Their response was \"no, we are not giving any refunds. If we gave you a refund we would have to give everyone a refund.\"  So I spoke to the GM. At this point I just wanted my account canceled. She wouldn't cancel my account because when you initially sign up there is a 90 day mandatory period. Fine my $27 takes me to my 90th day but I still wouldn't be using the gym. The GM said oh btw in ten days you're going to be charged approximately $45 for your annual fee.  Wait what? I explained that it's not that I don't want to use the gym it's that I can't again due to my wife's condition. GM then mentioned she may need to contact her manager and get a doctors not about my wife's condition. I've called everyday since to get an update from the GM and have been unsuccessful because the GM is always busy but won't return my calls even though I leave my information. Finally someone talked to me and relayed messages between the GM and I on the phone because the GM Kirstey won't take the call.

The childcare has a musty mold smell, just look at the carpet in the child care room. \nThe manager brian is unprofessional and rude. He started yelling at me and my husband in the middle of the weight floor instead of pulling us aside and telling us our child is crying. He started telling us the policy is a kid crying 5-7 min and it's stressful for everyone involved to force our kid to cry for that long, he went on to tell us that he would never bring his 8 month old out at 5p because that's his child's  cranky time. And a bunch of bullshit before I got to ask him if my child was crying right now. Finally my husband grabbed my child out of the childcare and we left pissed off. I called back 10 min down the road to cancel the membership and Saul answered the phone. I said \"'hi I was just in..\" He cut me off saying \"yea with the crying child hold on Brian was helping you\". Wow, this gym was  horrible experience. Brian gets on the phone, I tell him it's best if we cancel membership because our child can't stop crying in there child care all of the sudden( first month I did 2 a days and he was completely fine playing in there. No issue) all of a sudden one day we started having issues and the girls had to get us almost every time we went. We stopped coming 2x a day and shortened our length to 20-40 min workouts. Nothing was working. Brian's response was \" why didn't you cancel it before you left here?\" I said \" I wanted to make a rationed decision and not in the heat of the moment\". He said well you're going to have to come back and sign a paper being you are 2 months in your membership and contract is until 3 months we won't charge you your last month but your fees for this month are in process so we can't stop it. Ok whatever, next morning I drive 10 miles to crunch just to sign this paper. I walk through the door and janell at the front desk tells me there's no paper to sign and her and Saul don't know why he told me to come sign a paper. So the outcome was I drove there for no reason, Brian never sent the email to corporate to close both my husbands & my account.

In March 2020 I decided to joint Crunch Fitness on Bloomingdale. Of everyone knows COVID happened shortly after. During the state wide shutdown I attempted to find a number to call crunch in order to cancel my membership because my wife is high risk. Of course there are no general contact number because the gym is franchised.  I tried contacting the gym during the closer and was unsuccessful. So, on Monday May 18, 2020 Gym's opened as well did crunch fitness. I called them at 0800 to cancel my account. They said in order to cancel I would have to go in person or send a certified letter.  So after work at 3pm I stopped by. I learned that as of that day everyone in crunch was charged $27 which was ok if I was going to use the gym. I talked to the AM and explained that I won't be using the gym at all because of my wife's status and asked if I could be refunded my money because of COVID. Their response was \"no, we are not giving any refunds. If we gave you a refund we would have to give everyone a refund.\"  So I spoke to the GM. At this point I just wanted my account canceled. She wouldn't cancel my account because when you initially sign up there is a 90 day mandatory period. Fine my $27 takes me to my 90th day but I still wouldn't be using the gym. The GM said oh btw in ten days you're going to be charged approximately $45 for your annual fee.  Wait what? I explained that it's not that I don't want to use the gym it's that I can't again due to my wife's condition. GM then mentioned she may need to contact her manager and get a doctors not about my wife's condition. I've called everyday since to get an update from the GM and have been unsuccessful because the GM is always busy but won't return my calls even though I leave my information. Finally someone talked to me and relayed messages between the GM and I on the phone because the GM Kirstey won't take the call. I was told \" Kirstey has already passed your information to her manager and he will get back with you. We no longer have access to your account and can't change the active status.\"  There was no guarantee that the annual charge wouldn't be charge to my account nor that I would get my $27 back and my account was still active.

The photos on the Doylestown Rock Gym website make this gym look much larger than it is. This place is actually extremely small with a only a few walls to boulder on - the rest are for top roping. Things got even more frustrating though when I tried to boulder. None of the holds went above 8 feet, 10 at most. For someone who is 5'8, this was the biggest disappointment. On many of the walls, I could start and be up the wall with maybe two moves. Their setup forced me to practice traversing for two hours - which I guess isn't bad but I was hoping to be challenged, not bored.\n\nAside from the setup, the overall aesthetic left a lot to be desired, maybe the safety too. Many of the holds were totally falling apart and would slide off their screws when you grabbed them. Some of the holds were also on thinly painted walls just covered by a piece of falling apart wood - especially in their \"ice climbing\" hallway. Also, and I don't know how they get away with this, there were hardly any crash pads. Every other gym I've been to had stacks of crash pads available for climbers.

They have overhangs, flat walls, a cave, a hallway, an upstairs bouldering area... lots of places to go with ratings from V0 to ??? (didn't pay attention b/c I can't do much more than a V3, but I'm sure they go up to at least V8 or higher).  Crash pads are scattered around and there's plenty to play on no matter what your level.\n\nThey have pretty good top-roping too, though it's a little smaller than some of the other gyms in the area.  About 15 or so top ropes are set up with multiple climbs on each.  Pass a quick belay test on the ATCs and you're good to go.  Good variety of features - cracks, aretes, a chimney, inclines, etc.  The best wall is the barrel; it's tough pulling yourself up over the bottom part and the incline at the top pumps out your arms even more, but you'll get major kudos for doing it.  At least the preschoolers watching us clapped.  5.11 is the highest I noticed, but then again I can't climb more than 5.9 currently so I may just not have noticed.  Definitely a lot of good beginner and intermediate climbs though.\n\nThe gym is really kid-friendly too.  Birthday parties, parents with kids... rugrats were all over the place.  The staff is good at keeping things organized and making sure everyone is safe.  They even have a separate \"kids\" wall.  Staff is friendly in general.\n\nMy friends and I spent a good 5 hours here on a Saturday afternoon trying everything out (even took a break and ordered in pizza from a local shop).

I like the lockers with no locks and you can set your own code.  I peaked in the private bathroom and it was very clean and had a shower, hair dryer and a few products to use after the ride. \n\nAfter grabbing some goodies and chatting it up with some other Yelpers, we were able to go find out seats.  There were three rows of bikes all facing the instructor and two mounted tvs.  The room temperature was perfect.  \n\nFirst off, my gym has not upgraded to the bikes that have the display with your heart rate, speed, time, etc.  So, I was already excited once I saw that.  Then, when I hopped on my bike after adjusting the seat and handle bars and did a small test ride, the bike was super smooth.  \n\nThe ride was the same time as my usual class, but a lot more animated.  Our instructor was very upbeat the entire ride.  He was able to display videos on the tvs and alternate back to our stats.  For some reason my stats did not show up on the board, but I was immediately emailed my stats from after the class.  I feel like I got a good workout and it was good to changeup from my regular routine.  The music was good, but he made it fun.  I liked the changing lighting too.\n\nUnfortunately, I have to wait for a closer location to open near me...in Avon.  I guess Traders Point will be my best bet. Good workout.  I do have to admit that they are a bit pricey,  Switching from a gym membership to this would cost you more money; however, there are more classes offered than my gym.

I clicked on a link for a promotion on FB - 30 day challenge! How exciting! I needed the accountability and support. I spoke with Mandi, who encouraged me, offered me a first class free, and really kept on me about getting me in and started. All good. I paid the $149. First red flag, she had always wrote me back promptly (text message), but when I saw on my account that there was an auto monthly renewal- I wrote back and heard nothing for over a day. I went in for my next ride, and spoke to someone else about this being a one month promotion. \n\nThere is NO benefit to the one month challenge that I paid $149 for only to see the price go down to $99 within a few days. I asked for the remainder to be credited to another month and was told no. Not only told no, but that girl never spoke to me again - even in passing. There are no extra perks- I was told there was a Nutrionist coming to speak - she came, but just set up a table and advertised her products. Nothing extra for the challengers - I never met another challenger. I wasn't encouraged to keep coming and I actually stopped. It's just a marketing ploy - I was bamboozled. I wouldn't encourage anyone curious to try the challenge - you can just pay the $99/month and follow their social media for all the happenings. I don't blame Mandi at all - I'm sure the promotion came from corporate- just sharing my experience.", "date": "2019-06-02 14:18:24"}, {"_key": "614085", "_id": "reviews/614085", "_rev": "_fNysSDy--Z", "review_id": "40XsgXn40ntYzsfXS7b2RA", "user_id": "uRgAL9v1PSVlmoY7VKlc4Q", "business_id": "ZpXgr1Vq2wl1qS2SWB-eoQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "text": "I am a big fan of spin class workouts.

For one the technology in class.   They also have been giving water bottles away to each member of the class to keep.  The cooling towels and additional space between bikes is perfect. \n\nI look forward to them growing the number of classes.

It's also right across the street from my office! I signed up online, bought a discounted beginner package of 3 classes, and scheduled my classes online as well.\n\nThey have clip-in shoes that you can use for free (or bring your own compatible ones) that they wash after every class along with the towels (as far as I can tell). The bikes are great - fully and easily adjustable, with a light-up screen that shows you things like RPM, an estimate of calories burned, and the resistance level you're currently at, which is really useful. Each instructor has a different personality, which is interesting, so you can get some variety or pick a favorite and schedule your classes with them. You can choose whether or not your stats show on the scoreboard in class, but either way, your results get emailed to you automatically right after each class with a summary of how you did. The mood is great, with low lighting, and the instructor can choose different colors of lights. Depending on the song, there are sometimes videos on the screens up front.\n\nI also love that they have lockers to secure your stuff so you don't have to worry about whatever you bring in, free water bottles which you can fill there, and snacks - I always grab a banana on the way out for a post-workout refuel.
