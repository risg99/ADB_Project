There is nothing else positive I can say about them. The place is so badly run it is almost comical.\n\nMy experience went like this: My mom, sister and I went to find a bridesmaid dress for my wedding. We walked in on a very slow morning and were ignored. The salespeople saw us come in but didn't say a word to us. My mom and I spent about 20 minutes combing through the extremely disorganized racks and both had an armful of dresses. The salespeople watched but did not offer to start a fitting room nor did they try to help us find a dress. Oh yeah did I mention we were the only customers in the store? We were. For the whole hour we were there. And the staff was standing around chatting with each other (in Cantonese or Mandarin I think) and on the phone with people who were obviously not customers. I don't think any of them cared that we were there.\n\nSo we ended up randomly choosing a fitting room and my sister started trying on the dresses. Once she had tried on about half the dresses a salesperson waltzes into her change room without asking and just takes ALL the dresses out. I told her that we weren't done trying dresses on yet and that there were a couple that i might choose for my wedding. At this point she started acting friendly in the most obvious fake way. She brought out swatches and started hovering around us. When we were down to deciding between 3 dresses she did this ridiculous fake giggle thing and says \"oh you guys like everything!\" Uh no we were deciding between 3 and was that really the most helpful thing she could think of to say? I ended up choosing one of the dresses as my bridesmaid dress but we bought it at another store in Edmonton because of how horrible our experience at Mina's was. \n\nThis store has been in business in WEM for years and I don't get it. They clearly don't care about the customers in their store, they have no desire to help out nor do they have any people skills at all.

I pulled up yelp and found this place. The reviews look good so we decided to try it. It was Thursday night around 9:00pm and a slightly chilly night so plenty of empty tables outside so figured we would have no wait. The hostess told us that they had calls out to other customers waiting for those tables and had to give them 15 minutes to show up. The thing is those customers put their names in an hour ago, don't think they are coming. So it was very frustrating we had to stand around waiting for 15 minutes when there were 5+ empty tables. This place would of been 4 stars otherwise. \n\nNow onto the drinks and food. We were trying to decide between two bottles of wine and the waitress kindly brought us out a taste of both. We went with Domain Gayda- 'Flying Solo' Grenache Blanc-Viognier and it was pretty reasonable in price at $36 for the bottle. \n\nThen we decided to share a few appetizers. We got the BRIE & CONFIT CROQUETTES, LOCAL SQUASH BRUSCHETTA and CRISPY PUMPKIN GNOCCHI. The LOVED the gnocchi. You could tell it was made fresh and the flavor was delicious. The Leek Hay on the bruschetta was different but tasty.

The food is great and unique for the desolate culinary wasteland in which we live, and we were happy to find a place featuring fantastic, creative cocktails for me alongside craft beer for my husband. We especially appreciated the variety of local beers on tap. Today I read that Cinder has joined a small boycott of NJ breweries and will no longer serve their beer in protest of a proposed change in the law that would allow local breweries to skip the mandatory tour of the facility and sell packaged snacks like bags of chips. A few bar/restaurant owners are protesting because they feel it will devalue their liquor licenses. How on earth is going to a brewery that only serves one brand of beer and snacking on some Fritos at all comparable to going out to a nice restaurant and enjoying your pick from a variety of alcohol and menu options? When we go to a brewery we are looking for a completely different experience than we do when going to a restaurant or bar. Last week we went to Death of the Fox, which is just a few doors down from Cinder, and we were planning to go to Cinder tomorrow night. Going to the brewery doesn't mean we no longer want to visit Cinder too. Having a local brewery in the same shopping center shouldn't affect Cinder's business in the long term if they continue to focus on serving tasty food and a variety of beverages. I assume this protest is in direct response to a brewery opening up next door. Way to be neighborly and welcoming of a new local business. I was hoping we'd see Death of the Fox beer on tap at Cinder so this is especially disappointing. Obviously we'll find somewhere else to go tomorrow since we too feel we have something to protest, in this case an unwise business decision on the part of the restaurant owner.", "date": "2017-08-31 14:10:43"}, {"_key": "1000056", "_id": "reviews/1000056", "_rev": "_fM14PS6--i", "review_id": "SvTuI3aZW_qQSr1m44V8HQ", "user_id": "sVB9qCYlWn4FonAfRXrvwQ", "business_id": "P-rEyB0Pdf45rBqQFI-9xw", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Do you want a clean place to eat.

Not only that, but your beer prices seem to increase with each new menu you put out.  No reason a Bell's or Upland should be running $5 a pint.  I guess the term \"recession buster\" does not apply. \n\nI normally love giving rave reviews about restaurants but the last few times I have visited your 96th St location and your Downtown location (both in Indianapolis) I have been under-whelmed/dissapointed.  We'll give an overview.\n\nAmbiance - 4 hosts at the host stand greet you, but they don't necessarily seat you.  They just stood there and basically expected you to pick a table.  Blaring music from the late 90s was a plus but made it hard to hear each other at 6pm.  Every TV but one was on the same station.  I love ESPN, but what is the use in having multiple sets if they are all playing ESPN?\n\nMenu - We get it Scotty.  Your menu is 3 lbs.  You have a lot to choose from, but nothing is really above 2/5 stars in taste.  What happened to the 3 pager you had in Muncie where the food was quality and competitively priced?  I think you may be too big for your own good.\n\nSpecials - $12 Burger special and $4 beer special.  Not anything special about that.\n\nSever - This was a complete joke.  The guy didn't know the menu, didn't know the specials, didn't know the difference between a draught beer or a bottled beer, and couldn't tell us which beers were from Indiana (which was the special).  He kept using the excuse \"we are getting a new menu so everyone is confused\" We were patient with him, as he was foreign, and allowed him to make FIVE separate trips to the bar to verify the above questions.  Piss poor.  Not to mention he phantomed out on the meal after he had his food runners drop it off with no pre bussing and no check.  We actually had to leave our seat to find him to get the check.\n\nFood - Like a said usually a strong suit that could save the experience, but not this time.  We had a handful of differnt items, nothing worth having again.  One lady ordered a cajun tuna sandwich which came out as a well done tuna steak on rice.  I know that its the midwest but tuna is meant to be rare or seared, not light brown on the inside.  The cole slaw was rancid and the chicken in the appetizers and the wraps was dry and tasted a bit old.  Not even the \"Mo Fo\" sauce could hide how bad it was. Just an overall dissapointment from a brand that used to mean quality.\n\nScotty if you get the chance to read this, maybe you can make a few changes:\n-Stop wasting money on oversized menus\n-Stop with the daily email spam on supposed specials and events\n-Return to quality in - hiring, food taste, beer specials, and general professionalism as a business\n-You had a great brand, stop running it into the ground.", "date": "2010-07-14 15:31:41"}, {"_key": "1000063", "_id": "reviews/1000063", "_rev": "_fM14PT----", "review_id": "ryicmNl1fvB7vdW2_WQzug", "user_id": "iN8UmCrCKqs64MxVyf2Dqw", "business_id": "NHb6QTrJOnyIj-Zd0fYzFg", "stars": 5, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "text": "Love this place!

I recently moved to Levittown, Pennsylvania after graduating college and found a great Trini spot in Hamilton, New Jersey about 20 minutes from my house where I can get some great, cheap, authentic Trinidadian eats. Then, I moved to Warrington, Pennsylvania, and began to crave some good Trinidadian food! I did a search on the Internet for places nearby and this came up. Upon entering the place and looking at the menu, I could tell that the food was primarily Jamaican despite the owners being Trinidadian. That was no problem for me because I love Jamaican food as well. The food was very tasty: I got a fish sandwich as well as a curried shrimp platter with rice and beans and cabbage. My total came out to almost $26. The food was pretty decent. However, it was extremely, extremely pricey. The shrimp platter in itself was $15, and most of the other platters on their menu range from $14 to $16. (The fish sandwich was  $7.) Coming from Queens, and also having traveled around Brooklyn as well, I knew that this price was outrageous. I've gotten similar platters for $9, $10 max in NYC. Maybe even $12, but nowhere near $15. The food was very good for what I have eaten around Pennsylvania, but it was also not as good as the platters in NYC in terms of taste.

We were staying in the Overland area, so we were looking for restaurants more centrally located, not downtown.  After reading several reviews, we settled on Pastaria in Clayton.   We arrived there around 6:30 on a Sunday evening and found street parking easily.  When we walked in, we realized that it was packed!  I was still on Tennessee time and so that felt like 7:30 to me and I was starving, so we grabbed the last two seats at the counter.  Kind of awkward and right on the end, but we loved it.  We had a great view of their wood fired oven and the stoves.  Watching the chef's work was fascinating.  I'm so glad that we didn't sit somewhere out in the restaurant!\n\nOur waitress, Tiffany, was excellent.  She answered all of our questions and took our order quickly.  My husband ordered the Wood Oven Roasted Chicken.   I ordered the Italian Ramen.  We split a mixed green salad.  They split the salad for us and it was perfect.  A nice spring greens mix with pears, walnuts and goat cheese.\n\nIt did take a while for us to get our food, but we didn't really mind.  We were watching the chef's work, the pizzas being made and of the goings on behind the counter.  We kept trying to guess which chicken in the oven was going to be my husbands.  When the food came, it was more than worth the wait.  My husband's chicken was fantastic.  It was a large chicken breast with part of the wing.  It was smokey with crisp skin, but still moist inside.  It was served with a bread salad of toasted bread, cucumbers, tomatoes and pickled red onions.\n\nMy Italian Ramen was incredible.  I could eat this every day for the rest of my life.  The broth was insanely rich and flavorful and almost thick from the grana padano cheese.  The ramen noodles, perfectly chewy and the chicken, smoky and tender.  Topped with a perfectly cooked soft egg and fresh basil.  I was going to try and get the runny egg yolk food porn shot, but I knew that once I put my spoon it it, I was going to be all about the eating, and not about the photos.  I want to try and make this at home.  It was like chicken noodle soup kicked up several hundred notches.\n\nNext time we go to St. Louis, it's going to be hard to stick to our only new restaurant rule, because this ramen is going to be calling to me.", "date": "2015-08-08 02:33:09"}, {"_key": "1000113", "_id": "reviews/1000113", "_rev": "_fM14PTC--Q", "review_id": "AuBAxss4fzGcQ-V8AhdRhw", "user_id": "yXw13vZtZi-J9xDW_GHxSA", "business_id": "ZTctPm8-lBy0iJ9dFhYhyQ", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Service superb.

Overall, the portions are small, and there is nothing particularly exceptional about this experience. Prices are a bit over inflated and I had a hope that my second experience would offer more.

It's been real, but I am over it.\n\nFollowing the white pizza catastrophe, I sought to raise my spirits with the \"Stuffed Slice\".\n\nImagine a pie, but it's pizza. Bottom crust (like any pizza) then an inch or two of mozzarella, ricotta and other goodness and a TOP CRUST and that's what you have. You know what? Just check the picture, I can't explain it and do it any sort of justice.\n\nThe pizza is very good; it's in the top five on it's own. The \"Stuffed Slice\"; it's over the top. It's fantastic. I am a convert. I will never go here again without getting it. It is a must. My only criticism, (God, I'm really splitting hairs here) is that they only do one type of \"stuffed slice\", as best I can tell. I have to defer to my man Fred Zand who said it would be great to have some other types, a cheesesteak or something and some other samplings. This pizza is really something that you have to try. I love it, and you won't convince me that it doesn't have magical properties. If you're on a diet, break it. You have to have this pizza; you too will be a convert.", "date": "2013-05-11 14:26:05"}, {"_key": "1000137", "_id": "reviews/1000137", "_rev": "_fM14PTG--_", "review_id": "RfI1OyCVpPafIFbuGdYWGw", "user_id": "riQse-6ETVSeMkTJcRRjcQ", "business_id": "i2rTkdbTyqgxcBopIGRT6g", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I read about Pet Vet on the internet and liked their story (they've grown out of two different locations since opening almost 20 years ago)...so I made the drive with two kids in tow for our cat's annual checkup.\n\nThe receptionist Nancy was super super friendly!!!

Quality ingredients aren't cheap, but beans, bread, and rice aren't exactly luxury goods either.\nWe stopped in for brunch today, and had the choice of breakfast or lunch food. I had the field and dreams salad, which was fresh mixed greens, pickled onions, yams, orange segments, and walnuts. All the ingredients were good and crisp, but the portion was pretty meager for $8.00. My friend had the Rita Pita Pizza, which was basically a pita pizza, for $8.00, which had skimpy toppings and also seemed overpriced. She enjoyed her smoothie (for $6.00!) made with fresh fruit, and I liked my coffee. Mashed avocado toast that we added on because we were still hungry, was absurd. For $4.50, we a piece of diner-sized toast, with some avocado and nutritional yeast on top. At least I didn't have to worry about portion control or getting a to-go box.\nI know I'm harping on prices, but I felt like I could get food that tasted much better at other local places: Fork, Juniper, Locavore, etc that is just as healthy and quality. Banking on the health halo to support the restaurant and the prices is irritating.\nI love the idea of the Cultivate plate, however, which you can buy and pay extra for to support meals for those who can't afford as much. As a vegan, I also support any restaurant who makes eating cruelty-free a priority. I think it's great they have healthy food and are a much needed third option for veg*ns in Boise. I just think they're relying on being in a small market and not serving the quality they could.\nI spent several years in Santa Monica where they had amazing vegan food, and I think Boise could really step up and do better.

Here, it's about the same for cheesesteak,  hoagie and pizza. So I went around and tried a few places around me.  Someone in my family said Vids. I tried it, but chose a meatball sub.  Fresh homemade meatballs.  Delicious, except the sauce is a little heavy with oregano. Ive since then tried Vids cheesesteak with fried onions,  ham and cheese hoagie, scrapple/egg/cheese sandwich,  pork roll sandwich, corned beef special on rye, and cheeseburger. I basically tasted my way 'back home', grabbed some wise potato chips, a birch beer soda, a soft pretzel and a Jewish pickle. (Not all on the same day). Everything was homemade where it could be.  The meat is loaded into their sandwiches and is as awesome looking as it tastes.  This is the only sandwich shop I'm going to go to from here out.  I have paid the same or more elsewhere for similar food and got less meat and less philly flavor.  By far the best deli in Burlington county.  Maybe the workers are old philly residents, they remind me of when I lived in philly.

I was quick enough to catch myself before toppling over it, but the guy who entered a few seconds later was not.

They also weren't too keen on the baby. We had to split up between a booth in the back and seats at the bar and our server actually had the nerve to ask us to only order drinks from her. OK. So we'll stand by the table, order drinks, then go drink them by the bar. 20 minutes later they relinquished a large, unoccupied table held for a no-show reservation. Some of us moved to the table, some stayed in the booth that was within arm's reach. They said we had to give up the booth. This still did not solve the problem of the lacking seats.

We were told that the music was great and it was a much different and better experience than Bourbon Street. Snug Harbor was recommended as a good restaurant on Frenchman Street so we decided to try it. Unfortunately, we were disappointed in the atmosphere and food. While the music we heard playing upstairs sounded great, we could not get tickets ($15 each) until the next show which was 10:00 p.m. and since it was only 8:00 p.m. we decided to pass. For the initial impression, the restaurant lacked character. It was very plain and cafeteria like. But we were seated right away and looking forward to enjoying a nice meal. Our waitress was friendly and got us our drinks. The drinks were good. I had a Captain Morgan and Coke and my husband had a Tanqueray gin and tonic. I wanted a burger and since we heard Snug Harbor was known for good burgers I ordered the cheddar burger. Since the baked potato it came with seemed too heavy, I ordered a salad instead with blue cheese dressing. About 5 minutes after we ordered, the waitress came by and said they ran out of blue cheese dressing. Well, I was disappointed (and surprised) but since I had watched a couple enjoying the gumbo, I told her I would get that instead. Then she said, \"We ran out of gumbo too...I'm sorry.\" Uh...really? Wow...okay. Anyway, I decided to just get the baked potato and box it up. However, when I got my burger, it was a huge piece of meat but with no flavor to speak of and topped with shredded cheddar cheese. The bun was burned so bad it was black. So I ended up eating the potato instead of the cheeseburger. Unfortunately, that set our evening off to a negative start. We ended up calling it an early night. On the bright side, my husband had the fried chicken sandwich and loved it.

We were all pretty happy that another BBQ place was occupying the former Dickie's location, since you can never have too much BBQ, so giving this place a shot was a no-brainer.\n\nThe Good:\n- The BBQ was very good. I had the brisket and tried a coworker's turkey. Both were great.\n- My french fries were small and crispy, just like I like 'em. More surface area to get good and fried (compared to say, steak fries).\n- Lots of BBQ sauce choices at each table. I'm a fan of the sweet.\n- Ski on tap! The soda fountain had ski, along with lots of other relatively obscure (and sugar based) sodas. It's a very nice change from the normal Coke versus Pepsi choices.\n- Great customer service. We were greeted quickly by a host, who offered a quick rundown of our options, and every person in the food line served us with a smile.\n- It was fast. I'm sure that might be obvious considering the type of restaurant it is, and the fact that they aren't cooking to order, but it's an important point for the work lunch crowd. You can get in and out in good time.\n\nThe Bad:\n- The soda fountain! Oh god, the soda fountain. As another reviewer also pointed out, the soda fountain layout is TERRIBLE. You walk past it on entering, then get instructed to double-back for your drink before ordering. Want seconds during lunch hour? Fight your way through the line of people waiting to get food and it's all yours. A much better location for this would be over by the exit, in the little area where the trash is today.\n- The potato salad. I'll admit, I'm pretty picky about my potato salad. Few stand up to my gold standard (homestyle red potato salad w/ egg from Schnucks. get some.) and this was no exception. It was just bland and boring. Like somebody insisted that they have potato salad, since it was BBQ, but nobody there really knew how to make it.\n- The tray. You don't get plates at SugarFire, they give you a metal tray with butcher paper on it that you get your food on. And that would be fine, except that mine wasn't level. It had a big dent in the bottom so I would push down into my food with a fork or knife and the other side of the tray would pop up, constantly, like I was sitting at a table with a short leg.\n- The size. I can't say this is a really big negative, but it's important to note that this is not a good place for bigger groups. If you go off peak you can probably pull a few tables together, but during lunch hour I wouldn't really want to try with more than about 4.\n\nI'll be back to SugarFire, for sure. I'll make sure to get a flat tray, and I'll just skip the potato salad; problems solved there. The fountain needs to go, though. They just opened so they get a pass for now, but if that doesn't get moved soon I'll probably drop another star off my review.", "date": "2012-10-14 21:09:23"}, {"_key": "1000342", "_id": "reviews/1000342", "_rev": "_fM14PTe--I", "review_id": "zIXSPLOtGlv9b5xxzphiZQ", "user_id": "G80qpGf8tV4N3ic60DOK1A", "business_id": "GmaZOaUG47DRbfzKAGKwcA", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Great food and homemade soda's.

Zero communication, below par services - don't waste your time and instead find a professional dental office - there are still a few good ones left.\n\nLast year we switched insurance, went from top notch coverage to a notch down, so I moved to this dental office.  What a huge mistake!  I had my first cleaning, which was so terrible that it was visible how little was done to clean my teeth. I had told the hygenist that, since I have a high risk of periodontitis, I was on an regiment of a deep cleaning, followed by a regular cleaning, four times a year at my previous dentist.  She obviously ignored this information and her version of regular cleaning was beyond terrible.  I then called the office and spoke to the manager about it.  They got me in to see a specialist, who agreed that I should be on the old regiment from now on.  \n\nAfter my first deep cleaning and then a regular cleaning, I tried to schedule the next deep cleaning appointment.  I was THEN told that my insurance will not cover any kind of cleaning until the end of the year and it will be over $150 out of pocket.  When I said I was told to see the specialist who will approve the regiment (and my insurance company will pay based on this approval) I was now told that the insurance will not approve it, unless after the first cycle of deep cleaning/regular cleaning, the specialist performs some sort of gum surgery.  The initial advice they gave me was wrong, what the specialist told me was wrong and now my only option was to come see the specialist for a new assessment.  His next available appointment was over 3 months later - January 22.  \n\nI arrived 10 minutes early and proceeded to wait another 35 minutes.  When I went to inquire whether it will be much longer, I was told that they do not know exactly how long, but there are two people before me...  I told the receptionist who checked me in that had she mentioned something when I arrived, it would have been better.  She was unapologetic and said that he is running late and that cannot be helped and the other receptionist chimed in advising me to maybe keep this appointment as the specialist's next available appointment is in April.  Needless to say this nonchalant attitude, coupled with the lack of communication since day one, made me walk out and write this review.  I am counting the months until I can purchase the top notch insurance again and move to my old dentist office.", "date": "2018-01-22 17:54:49"}, {"_key": "1000365", "_id": "reviews/1000365", "_rev": "_fM14PTe--f", "review_id": "zmptn8YOPXWD_xEsque6KA", "user_id": "CaVEy7kpASLwNBGymLwhgw", "business_id": "WykmE4FdA3UThjU88SfIxw", "stars": 3, "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "While this is the closest theater to where I live; I normally drive up to the Regal Park 16 for several reasons:\n\nThe Bad:\n1)  few movie showtimes & the last showings are pretty early in the night\n2)  It smells like really bad, old, stinky, atrocious feet when you open the doors to each theater\n3) They have Pepsi on fountain and not Coke\n4) If there are a lot of people that show up (this rarely happens here), they are not equipped to handle it with the 2-4 employees visible at any given time. \n5) No RPX, crappy 3D and IMAX that doesn't seem to be any better than the regular screens\n\nThe Good:\n1) You are often in an empty/ almost empty movie theater (hence no cell phones and giggly teens to ruin the movie).\n2) It's generally quick to get your movie ticket and get into a seat. \n\nTo Note:\n1) No immediate free parking right in front of the theater.

Add a tartine, piece of quiche, small salad, and we have the makings of a legit Saturday lunch. Lucky for me, Like Home offers all of the above, which saves me from pulling my hair out during my macaron-ing adventures. They also have bags of homemade marshmallows, which I make on the regular, but just couldn't help but buy a $7.50 bag.\n\nAdditionally, the food was delicious. We enjoyed a salmon tartine and a croquette madame followed by a couple pastries. Each item was served with a small salad and they offer balsamic, ranch and caesar dressings (a bit strange for a cafe, I'd say). I was expecting a few vinaigrettes or other varieties, but I went with caesar. The tartine and croquette were divine. A few problems arose with the pastries.\n\nWhen we arrived, the area where you order is haphazard. You do not know where the line is or where to stand, and either way you are going to be in someone's way. The girl taking orders was 90% clueless. It took her 5 minutes for each of us to place a one person order. I pointed to ONE remaining rectangular bar, described it, and asked if it was a lemon bar. She said yes. I ordered it. After sitting down, another woman came over to tell me it was passion fruit, which I said I would take. She then told the people that ordered directly after me that the passion fruit bar was already sold out so they had to get something else (the order taker sold ONE remaining bar to two people, back to back?) It gets better-she came back 5 min later to tell me that in fact it was sold (ok, so she sold ONE bar to three people??) I did not see anyone eating it and there was no one in front of me ordering, so I'm clueless where it went. I said I would take the berry tart, which had 3 up there previously. Those were now gone too. I settled for peach.\n\nThe flavored iced tea was sitting in a jug by the order taker. \"it's peach tea\". Strange since there were floating strawberries in it. Turns out, it was strawberry, or so we guessed. Definitely not peach.\n\nWe wanted to get macarons to go after eating, but after meandering around the register area as lots of people came in, we couldn't figure out where to stand or how to finagle the line. Further, some of the macarons look like \"mini macs\" but sign says they are all $2/piece. I'll pay $2 for a regular size (~1.5-2\" diameter) but not a 0.5\" diameter mac. In the end we left with no little cookies.\n\nI will probably be back, but with different expectations. I live near Patisserie Choquette and it's just a better run pastry shop, at least for now.

I personally found that all of the BAD Reviews are mostly Legit!. \n\nThis place should be famous for serving Way-Overpriced Portions of Uninspired Cuisine by a Waitstaff that would rather be somewhere else.  \n\nAdd one side-item, a cup of coffee plus tax & tip to your Breakfast Entree and you can expect to pay between $25 & $33 per person... for a half decent, small-portioned Breakfast!   \n\n$18 FOR FRENCH TOAST? ($14 menu price plus 9% tax & a 17% tip: rounds up to around $18 and I just can't see this entire plate costing them more than 85 cents in total food cost, plus or minus 15 cents).  The texture of the french toast was a bit weird with mush bananas and the Rum-flavored syrup had little flavor. I saw $10 sandwiches that came with a side dish that had more sustenance than the $18 French Toast. French Toast is Cheap (bread, milk, egg, butter, banana & syrup), for $20, you can serve French Toast to a lot of people at home. \n\nThe Hamburger was a disaster. The bun was overly crisp & dry to the point that it was difficult to eat. While trying to fit the burger in my mouth, the unseasoned hamburger patty fell apart into about 9 pieces. I had to eat it with a fork... pathetic!  The shoestrings Fries were good!  \n\nMy biggest turn-off about the Menu here is the constant repeat of the word \"Shane-Made\" as a combination spin off of the Chef's first name and the word \"homemade\" or \"housemade\". This was more annoying than it was cute. The Chef Owner's EGO seems to be larger than his ability to serve a decent, fair cuisine at a reasonable price. \"Shanemade\" has become our new word to describe a Restaurant's Cuisine that is Highly Overpriced and Underwhelming. \n\nUpon reading Chef Shane's Bio on his website, I learned that he had previously worked as a head chef under Emeril, but, on his own, he seems that he lacks the business knowledge and self-discipline to run an effective restaurant. Then I decided to Google 'Shane Pritchett' and learned from a (NOLA dot com) article that he and his wife were running a 'Ponzi Scheme' out of their Magazine Street Interiors Shop.

I do not generally like fish tacos, and lead the tragic life of being a picky eater...so let me tell you about how these fish tacos changed my life! Haha. My boyfriend and I live close (both originally from Birmingham, Al). We have been going to Taqueria Corona for these fish tacos since 2008. Always friendly staff, always magical fish tacos. We always (just about) order two fish tacos each, with chips/pico/guac, and cokes to drink. We normally don't get sodas, but their coke tastes wonderful for some reason! We consider that a rare treat. The guac is amazing. Pico is amazing. Cheese dip, we prefer elsewhere-we like the white cheese (Americanized I think...). I sometimes get the cheese and chicken quesadilla (which sounds like nothing special, but is really something incredible too) and we split that. Pro tip- if you get an appetizer with chips, tacos, AND a quesadilla for two people, you probably won't be able to finish...I have been getting instead (when I didn't want leftovers or we wanted a little cheaper bill) a chicken and cheese only taco. One of our favorite waiters said this was basically the same as the quesadilla-same quality cheese and chicken, but a smaller portion! I prefer no pico, but you can leave it as it comes if you wish! I get no cabbage on my tacos because I feel it's a little bitter for my taste, but even if I forget on accident to say it-they're still fabulous! We are regulars, and they always laugh and say \"see you tomorrow!\" As we leave. We will forever love our old waitress Jess who left for Panama recently, but love our other waiters and waitresses too! This place will always be special, because the first time I visited Josh in college from Birmingham, they let me sneak in the back and deliver their drinks-he was so surprised, and it was the best valentines gift ever! :)", "date": "2015-05-27 18:53:22"}, {"_key": "1000478", "_id": "reviews/1000478", "_rev": "_fM14PTq--V", "review_id": "oSnlLHNu0xkCqp28Sbr5PQ", "user_id": "EmiqDmfjVo4ZV-HJGRgo0g", "business_id": "HYiLl8OWiiUSVJpOQyXVsA", "stars": 5, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I enjoyed the whole experience at Biera.

When Karen saw my hair she immediately told me not to worry, that she was going to fix everything and it would look a thousand times better. She was wrong - it looks a million times better! She foiled my hair using a technique I've never seen before and then used a different dye on the hair outside the foils. She used two different glazes as well. What I really liked was that she never once made a disparaging remark about the other salon or colorist - very professional. She was super friendly, too. But my hair - it's gorgeous! I've gotten so many compliments on the color.

It could save both of you from serious injury. \n\nIf you're on a bike, park at Cypress Point Park and pick up the trail just outside the road that takes you back to the park entrance (at the entrance to the business park).

Enjoy the scenery because it's really pretty beautiful! Lots of different birds to check out and you might even get sprayed by some saltwater on your way back to Tampa.

My 1st visit would have been 3 stars because it didn't wow me, but it didn't really make me think I needed to ever go back either. \n\nSo I ordered the steak, it typically comes with mashed potatoes and broccoli with bread crumbs. I asked if I could switch the asparagus with the mashed potatoes and was told it would be a $1.00 upgrade fee...okay...didn't make sense to me since a side of asparagus was the same price as a side of mashed potatoes in the menu. Whatever, decided to not get the asparagus since I ate a ton of veggies at lunch. I ordered my steak medium...was told it had to be medium well or medium rare because there was no medium. Okay, did medium well because in the past when I get medium rare at places it's way too bloody. \n\nOkay, bread and oil comes. I do not have any. My friend does...and is unimpressed. Says I'm not missing much and she doesn't even really touch the oil after the first taste because it's just not a good grade of dipping oil. I dipped a spoon in and tried a bit and pulled a nasty face at the taste. \n\nWell, we only have a faint hope for the meal is good at this point. \n\nMy steak comes...burnt around the edges, and a very sad little pile of broccoli next to it. Steak was well done. Okay, I could have sent it back, but I'm not a send back person, sorry, I just don't trust people. You had your chance when you sent me the food. So, steak is...okay, not amazing, just okay, not what I wanted, just okay, I could eat it. Broccoli...just bad, no flavor, did not eat it. I blame veggies cooked like that for people saying they don't like vegetables. \n\nMy friend ordered the chicken marsala. She said chicken was just okay and the mushrooms, but the potatoes and green beans were funky. potatoes...don't know how they were cooked, just tasted wrong. Green beans seemed old and were overcooked, shriveled, and burnt. She did not finish hers. \n\nSooo yep, had we not had the gift card, we would have asked for our money back and just left a few bites in.\n\nMaybe their pasta is good.

Is it the garlic mashed pototoes?   Is it their world famous Happy Hour?  Is it the Lobster Bisque with the puff pastry on top, or maybe that they seem to have AWESOME people working for them.

The almonds on mine were bacon almonds, (can't beat bacon toasted almonds!) The spinach salad had pistachios and a dressing that was divine! \n\nFor the main course,  I had the, herb garlic flat iron steak. It was amazing, tender, and delicious! My son had the Parisian gnocchi. It was the best I've tasted in a very long time! (Yes, I got to try everything.)\n\nEven though I probably shouldn't have, I couldn't resist having dessert.Their Creme brulee is a no brainer, and one of my personal favorites. It was heaven! Then we tried their ice creams and sorbets. We had the pineapple-basil, rhubarb-ginger, beet, passion fruit-chili, and a melon-mint. My personal favorites were the pineapple, the rhubarb and the melon. The flavors are seasonal, so go try these while you can!\n\nI had such a lovely evening, and there was nothing that I ate that wasn't delicious and perfectly prepared!\nTheir venue is gorgeous.

This is a little belated, as I went to their soft opening when they first came to Goleta. Poke is a part of Hawaiian cuisine that's slowly swam its way into hip, trendy Southern Californian joints, and people are obsessed. Although not much of a raw fish aficionado, I love anything that's new and gives me a reason to reassure my mom that I've eaten something that wasn't bread or deep-fried in the last week.\n\nFor a soft opening, all the elements were there: harried workers, limited menu, line going out the door. Those are all things I don't believe influenced my review, but definitely something to note. They have a cool boba shop called Sno-Crave in there that I wasn't able to try, but I certainly will when I return for the cool glasses they serve them in. As for PokeMee, I'm not sure I can say the same.\n\nThe ingredients were all fairly good quality -- the fish didn't smell of anything other than the sauces they were marinated in. I definitely noticed that the crab meat that I paid an extra amount for was imitation crab meat. It just didn't have that same texture or taste that ordinary crab meat does. That's definitely a skip if I choose to return for the poke.\n\nI got a large bowl with salmon, yellowtail, albacore, shrimp and tuna. The shrimp was legitimately difficult to find after mixing my bowl together. I know that out of five proteins, finding one would be difficult, but I genuinely felt like I was chewing and everything was the same fishy texture. The edamame offered as a protein might be an interesting option to shake up the feeling of what I'm chewing if I return.\n\nAside from that, while it was a functional meal and I didn't get food poisoning, it was one of those cases where I hear someone going, \"I eat to live, not live to eat.\" It's sustenance, but it didn't quite dazzle me the way it did others.

The butterfly is one of their signature doughnuts.  Think of it as a honey bun/cinnamon roll in one.  The yeast doughnuts melt in your mouth.

For the entrees, we shared the fluke (very bland) gnocchi with romanesca sauce (very sour & bitter) & the scallops... 2 large scallops, this was the best of the 3.

We were so excited to try CCC and finally had brunch there today. 3 adults and 3 kids. We ordered several dishes as well as the famed ccc. The place was less than half full yet our wait for food was surprisingly long. After about 20 mins, the server seemed apologetic and offered us an appetizer as we waited, we accepted (stay tuned for more on that later). The app was toasted bread with a refried type black bean paste and cheese melted on top, it was good, not great but the kids liked it. About 5 mins after that came the tamale dish of one adult at the table, no one else's food was in sight. She liked her dish. Next came nachos: as another Yelper stated, it was good but with too many cold components to make it great. It seemed each dish came out within 10 mins of the one before... My husbands migas especial came and he, who has NEVER in all the years I've known him, not eaten what he's ordered, did just that today... He just did not like the soupiness not the flavor of the dish...total surprise to me. So we are 45 minutes into this meal and 3 kids have still not received the 3 chicken tacos they ordered and I did not get my dish. I got up and politely asked the server if we could cancel those orders as the rest of the table was already done. I asked why there had been such a delay (btw, I speak fluent Spanish so there was definitely no issue with understanding one another). The server just apologized and agreed that small kids should usually be the first to get fed (especially really you g ones, since otherwise you'll have a nacho chip throwing mutiny). She gave us the bill and guess what, she charged us $6.50 for the appetizer she offered us what seemed to be a co cession for the delay.

This place has a lot of room for\nImprovement , starting from the moment you walk in to the restaurant. \nAs son as I stepped in thru those door I was not greeted at all by the hostess ,I had to stand there to wait for her to do so , ( I still said hi first )then I promptly asked for the rest room. \nThe men's rest room also has a lot of room for improvement ,1.- for instance the odor as soon as you walk in, they had at least 6+ of those deodorants laying around and they all were VISIBLE to guests. As if they were some type of ornamental items.   \n2.i asked the hostess what the specials were for the day , first thing she pointed was to the clock before she even said the spatial of the day which she didn't know by heart she had to go grab a menu or pamphlet ( which I understand she might be new or something idk,also the language barrier could be an issue I may add I've being told I can come across as  a little intimidating  to others , not that I mean to but it's just the way I carry myself everywhere )\n3. She mentioned the happy hour specials about $1 off and also said something about \"mini chimis \" and she was hesitant about it , not very convinced about it. Which also doesn't look good , all employees need to be sure about all specials and if not have a daily special menu or \" cheat sheet\" handy so they don't have to walk away from the guest area and miss another one coming in. \n4.  I walk myself to the bar area and a women dressed with a tuxedo style attire greeted me promptly but in a \"dry and cold \" manner lacking of hospitality and/or welcomeness , she placed some\nSilverware and a menu and asked me if I was ready to order even tho I had just ordered a small pitcher of beer. The right question should have being \"\nWould you like to order something from our menu..our happy hour starts in about an hour ...etc c etc. \nBut none of that was done. \n5.-my salsa and chips were not refilled nor the bartender asked me for anything else until 45 minutes went by ( don't believe me ? Check your cameras ) she instead went and had a \"meeting\" with other employees , I don't know if it was work related but that's besides the point , she never checked with me for 45 minutes nor sent anyone Else to check on me. Keep in mind The restaurant was very slow from 2 to 3 pm , also saw the store manager I believe  walk around the store several times and not \"touch tables\" with any of the guest let alone to me. \n6.-a different bar tender girl came along after 3 pm (night shift I suppose ) and she was just as distant as the other tender , after I finished my small pitcher of beer around 3:10pm (hour and 10 minutes later ) I asked about special happy hour again but when I asked she was cleaning the blender and I said \" excuse me \" to what she answers \"yes\" ( but didn't Approached me to listen to what I had to say since I was siting at the extreme opposite corner of the bar , I wasn't going to yell across the room and say what I needed. \nThen I said : I have a question but with a certain tone of voice , not disrespectful but yet acknowledging I wanted her to approach me. \n\nYou as an enployeee even as a manager of this restaurant after reading my comments may or could be offended  for absolutely no reason , but if that's the case (I hope not because that's not the purpose of this review )  you should actually feel grateful that someone a customer that is , took the time to write this long review on your staff and premises to pint point something that you probably don't see while your \"managing\" , feedback from your guests is crucial is what gives you the opportunity to grow as a company and as a business.  Good or bad I necessary for growth. \nShorty after this I waned to pay my bill and get going , so I looked around and nobody was near by , I strongly dislike when this happens , there's no reason why a bar customer should be unattended let alone for that long period of time. \nSo I stood up to draw attention to me but no success i sat back down and stood up again but this time I made noise with the stool/bar chair and no luck again , despite the fact that the manager and bartender were behind me having a \"meeting\" , so I got up for the 3rd time\nAnd went to the restroom  and as I walked toward the back I notoced there were 4 female employees at the main entrance where register is at just chatting about non work related stuff , I went back to the bar and still no attention until i had to say I needed to cash out and had a really....", "date": "2017-02-01 23:07:35"}, {"_key": "1000701", "_id": "reviews/1000701", "_rev": "_fM14PUC--Y", "review_id": "07v5mO99MBcOtC_XaAPasw", "user_id": "e6JORaX5SepVjIrnuQoWnQ", "business_id": "NHb6QTrJOnyIj-Zd0fYzFg", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "I no longer live in St Louis but come back a few times a year to see family, friends, and stuff myself silly with BBQ and frozen custard.

We ended up at Enterprise because all the wait times of the places i yelped around were about an hour and a half - go figure, holiday weekend. I walked up and said \"A table for 6 please...\" the hostess' in front looked up at me (while talking away with another co worker) it will be a long wait. i said \"how long? \" she said \"40 minutes, we are very busy.\" I said that is fine and she said okay - handed me my buzzer i walked away... *rude* 50 minutes later i walked in and asked how much longer, the girl said i am sorry we are very busy and there is still 3 parties ahead of you i said okay that is fine, we will wait at the bar... We left to the bar (great bartender by the way) ordered a few drinks and hung around some more. I saw at least 5 parties get seated after, at this point i was hungry and impatient so i walked up to the gentlemen host in front and asked how much longer because originally i was told 40 minutes and it was more than hour already, he said i am so sorry we are going to clean up your table and seat you shortly. Seems like he actually did move some things around and finally an hour half later, we were seated.. *Thanks to the nice gentlemen who made it happen*\n\nThe host that sat us brought us some cold water while we waited, Our waitress was GREAT!

This place brims with potential, but it's not so close to living up to it. There are small things that left me ambivalent about SOHO. For one, the pizza options are definitely unique; however, they don't always pan out as excitingly as they do harmlessly waiting behind the converted deli case. The cheesesteak pizza, for example, isn't worth it. The cheese whiz on pizza was not what I anticipated, meaning it was kind of nauseating. My other complaint, just to clear the air, was that my pizza was lukewarm. They throw it in the oven for a few seconds to heat it up, but a solid minute or two was definitely in order for these slices. \n\nIt's a tough racket to open a pizza place. In Philly, there's one on every block. NYPD pizza, Old City Pizza, and every single Italian restaurant in the city come readily to mind. What SOHO has going for it is that it's at least different from the rest of the Market Street fare. What it needs is a staff that's a little better-trained (couldn't recommend the pizzas, just offered a generic 'everything's good') and a process to get the pizza to the right temp before dishing it out to customers. On top of that, they could reconsider the pizzas they sell by the slice. They're creative, I'll give them that, but I'd love to see that creativity go toward something better than their cheesesteak pizza or the mediocre buffalo chicken pizza.

You know there's a problem when the best thing on a menu promoting beef is the onion rings.\n\nThe onion rings are perfect, just the right thickness with a nicely spiced breading, and not at all greasy. The steak fries were thick wedges done to a golden brown, also not greasy but unfortunately coated with so much salt they were inedible.\n\nNow for the various beef dishes. The cheesesteak sandwich was a combination of the Philly classic and traditional grilled cheese. The meat was paper thin as it should be, but the peppers and onions were a little too thick, which made them too crunchy because they weren't cooked through. They were piled on a slice of white bread, covered with a slice of processed American cheese, topped with another slice of white bread, and then grilled on both sides. Certainly not your typical Philly cheesesteak, but at least it was flavorful.\n\nThe chopped sirloin steak was so dry it had the consistency of sawdust. The so-called Swedish meatballs were covered with a sauce containing a mystery ingredient we couldn't identify that gave them a very odd taste. The sliders were as thick as hockey pucks and just as hard. The pot roast was dry and tasteless.\n\nMany of the old choices, like roast chicken and mashed potatoes, are still here and still good. We thought the macaroni and cheese was greatly improved. In the past, it was overcooked and swimming in a sauce that tasted artificial. This time it was al dente, dry (in a good way), and tasted like it was made with real cheese. It actually had a nice crust on it. I don't know if this change was intentional or a fluke, but they should keep making it this way.\n\nThe bread pudding is very good. Most of the other desserts are too sweet. The sugar-free chocolate pudding is surprisingly rich and tasty.\n\nI think business here might be down - the place was nearly empty at 1:30pm - and maybe that's what prompted them to try a new menu. Now they might want to consider hiring a few new cooks who know how to prepare beef right.\n\nP.S. They serve a weekend breakfast that's much better than this new lunch and worthy of three stars.", "date": "2008-09-11 12:59:17"}, {"_key": "1000829", "_id": "reviews/1000829", "_rev": "_fM14PUS--A", "review_id": "2x9R6_uLY14eRPjiYPaJkg", "user_id": "Ny8NnREFL894xTsfbP7QLA", "business_id": "Wmeez3dUfKkCGZT3lMZGFg", "stars": 3, "useful": 1, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "text": "Good but not great.

Luckily everything was fine!\n\nWe took the 11:30am bus from Philly to NYC on Saturday (note: we didn't take it on the way back so can't comment on the NYC to Philly end of it).  We arrived about 10 minutes early.  It was easy to find and not confusing at all.  The Megabus boards right next to the Bolt Bus, west side of 30th St. Station and New York was the only bus boarding at the time.  Everyone was standing in an orderly line and we had no trouble finding 2 seats together.  And we got to ride on top of the double-decker bus...fun!\n\nWe left about 10 minutes after the scheduled departure time.  We got to NYC well past the 2pm (scheduled ETA was 1:30pm) due to traffic, but you can't fault them for that. I did not use the outlets or Wi-Fi, so I have no idea if they actually work.  One complaint is that it was COLD on that upper level.  I was wearing my winter coat, scarf and gloves and still felt the chill. \n\nUnlike the Bolt Bus, the seats are first come, first serve based on when you arrive to the bus, not how early you book your ticket.

The ice had a failry smooth consistency and was somewhere in the \"middle of the road\" between coarse like shaved ice and velvety smooth.\n\nThe flavors she chose were raspberry rose hips on one side and lime mint on the other.  The raspberry rose hips were too subtle, but would probably be good for someone who is looking for a refreshing dessert that was very unobtrusive and leaves practically no syrup aftertaste.  However, the lime mint was a real treat.  The lime had just enough tartness to make your mouth pucker (my mouth is watering now just thinking about it) but the cool mint aftertaste is very subtle and helps subdue the tartness of the lime.  To me, this is a great spring / summer flavor.\n\nThe line on a Sunday afternoon was only 3-4 people deep and we were served in less than 5-6 minutes.\n\nAll in all this was a pretty good snowball.

The tomatoes were very tasty, and the other vegetables were cooked just right not cooked to death like zucchini often is. The shrimp were a nice size and there were quite a few . I thought the dish was a good balance of flavors , not over powered by any one item. Everyones food looked good and  all were happy with what they got.   When we were finished with our dinner they brought out the cake that we had brought in that they had kept in their refit  while we were eating. As they came one they sang happy birthday.  The service was excellent, I wish that I remembered the waiters name, because he did a very good job , refilling everyones drinks at just the right time! Thank you for the pleasant mealtime!

The bf doesn't like seafood and he liked the fact that the pasta did not taste \"seafood-y\".  The clams were great - good quality and clean (no sand/grit!).\n\n4) NY strip - cooked perfectly.

First, upon check in, the clerk, who was friendly, seemed preoccupied and took 2 phone calls during the time it took us to check in.  During our time at the desk, another guest complained about the smell in their room, and they were moved.\n\nOnce we got to the room, we noticed that there was no remote for the TV.   Strange! Who steals a TV remote?  Anyway, the room was recently refreshed, small, but looked updated.  Bathroom was fine with a new tub surround.  \n\n I also noted that I forgot the charging cord for my iphone 4.  I went to the desk to ask for a remote and to see if they had a loaner charger (most hotels do, as people like me often forget them).  They were able to bring a remote, but apparently, all the phone cords are in the housekeeping office, and that was locked at 6pm on a Saturday, and not one had a key.  I asked what if we needed housekeeping, and didn't get a response.\n\nWe got back to the hotel around midnight, went to our room and got ready for bed.  At about 12:40, a very strange alarm started going off.  It would go off for about 45-60 seconds then stop for a few minutes, then go off again.  At about 1, I went to call the front desk, but the only phone in our room didn't work.\n\nThis morning, upon check out we inquired about the noise.  The clerk told us it was some type of fire alarm (kind of a problem that the fire alarm was intermittent, didn't sound like any fire alarm I have ever heard, and that the fire alarm light in our room didn't flash).  We told about the phone and were told they would fix that (we were checking out, so what difference did that make)\n\nI am not one to want free stuff when my stay is less than satisfactory, but this upset me.  No that we didn't get anything from the hotel for our troubles, but we didn't even get an apology for the magical fire alarm going off, having no idea what it was, and no way to contract the desk.  A simple thank you would have gone a long way.\n\nI also consider the $150 I paid for the night reasonable under the circumstances.  This is not the cheap $40 per night motel 6 next door (with all due respect)\n\nI would recommended against staying at this property until the staff learns how to treat the guests, and they do simple things, like keep TV remotes in the rooms, and have a working fire alarm system.", "date": "2014-08-03 20:05:33"}, {"_key": "1000897", "_id": "reviews/1000897", "_rev": "_fM14PUW--Z", "review_id": "G6Nc0rpcLCEGDV2HOvjXYw", "user_id": "bstGjztjo6ZOVX-rd01R7g", "business_id": "dsEWTyoP2eZwRfczWAk_ug", "stars": 4, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Suck it, McCallisters, they've got you beat.

They are using local ingredients and the food concepts seem to be a collaborative effort of everyone they have hired.  We went on the opening weekend and I thought the food was good (even very good), with a few dishes that had minor flat spots.  \n\nOne thing I think is important for you to know before you go:  \n\nWhile this is not a communal dining experience, it really is.  Although they set the room as individual tables, there is no more than a few inches between the tables.  You can't quite figure out whether you are supposed to talk to the people next to you (although you can hear every word of their conversation).  As soon as the wine starts flowing, it turns into a community dining experience.  A community dining experience is not for everyone, so keep this in mind before you make your reservation.  \n\nA few things I would suggest they consider doing:\n\nThe table next to us requested beer pairings, instead of wine.  The beer choices were lackluster, in my opinion.  They served Miller High Life as the dessert pairing--funny, but not for everyone.

Definitely a fan.  The space is not huge, the ambiance is nice (although I would prefer it just a tad bit darker).  Bartender Andy has pujt together a great drink menu; every one we tried was creative and tasty.  There's a limited but very good beer selection (Chimay, Delirium Tremens, Lindemans etc.).  We started with the asparagus which was good, and accompanied by two tasty dipping sauces.  We also tried the mussels which had an excellent garlic flavor; possibly the most flavorful mussels we've ever had (and the broth with bits of garlic was great for bread-dipping).  Next we tried the onion soup.  My wife thought it was a little short on cheese, but we both agreed the flavor was very good.  The dinner salads were good but not great, just a little plain (although the dressing was nice).  My wife tried the steak and fries and thought they were excellent (I tried both and agree).  Yummy fries, tender steak, and a great but not too heavy sauce.  I tried the vegetarian dish and was not quite as impressed by the flavor, although I suppose there are limits to what you can do with baked veggies.  We finished with one of the chocolate deserts.  Can't remember what it was called, but it essentially was a chocolate molten lava cake, very good.  \n\nWe ate at the bar, so I can't speak to the service other than to say Andy was great, and took excellent care of us.\n\nIn short, this is probably closer to a 4.5 star review than 5, but I'm rounding up as 4 just feels too low.

Hummus was good.  The pita bread was super greasy and appeared dipped in grease.  I Could have ordered friench fries for that much grease.  But, I ate it because it was good.  Filled me up, so I ordered the simple salad.  The salad appeared fine.  But, when I looked closely, a few of the shrimp were greyish, which means not fully cooked.  I DO NOT eat partially cooked shellfish.  Another server came and stated they can throw it back on the grill.  That violates Health laws.  I said, \"no thanks,\" and she brought me back another salad without the shrimp because I said hold the shrimp.  What upset me was, the original server came back and with an attitude.  He stated, \"buy the way, we took the shrimp and looked at it under a bright light and it WAS fully cooked.\"  We discounted the shrimp.  I said, \"It was not about $$.  Really?
