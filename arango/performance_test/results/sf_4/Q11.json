They use only Louisiana oysters and because of the oil spill in the Gulf, they cannot serve any dishes with oysters.  Boo.\n\nI subbed in a fish (catfish, I assume) po' boy instead and it was delectable.  It had catfish, shredded lettuce, slices of tomato, mayo, and pickles, inside a loaf of French bread.

Both businesses are located in Pie Town, a neighborhood on the southern edge of downtown Nashville. There's not a whole lot of stuff in this part of town. These are definitely two of the highlights.\n\nTennessee Brew Works opened on August 18, 2013. It's popular. This place has won numerous awards and earned plenty of recognition including the best brewery in Tennessee according to Yelp. These folks are all about being local, green, and sustainable. The taproom is two stories with views of the brewery from both floors. There's a patio with both covered and uncovered spaces (mostly uncovered) as well as a small, string-lit rooftop patio. As this is a brewery, the property has an industrial, warehouse feel to it, much like the other businesses in Pie Town. It's clean and modernized. The first floor of the brewery features a small stage for live music (a band was setting up on our way out) and the room upstairs, which is much more spacious, has TVs playing sports and nice overhead views of the brewery floor below.\n\nBrewery tours take place every Saturday at 3pm, 4pm, and 5pm. It costs $10 plus tax and a fee per person. Tickets for the tour can be purchased online.\n\nAlong with high-quality craft beer, the brewery also serves food. Their limited menu includes apps/snacks like Baja fish tacos, Springer Mountain chicken wings, salads, burgers, and sandwiches (including a Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich). Food prices range from $8 to $18 per plate.\n\nWe grabbed a few beers and hung out inside the taproom downstairs. Downstairs, they use barrels (some with tabletops) for tables with bar stools. We showed up around 2pm on a Saturday and the place was busy. It wasn't slammed or jam-packed, but most of the tables upstairs and downstairs were taken. Our group of six was lucky to find a table in a corner next to some brewery windows. The atmosphere was very relaxed and laid back. The staff was cool and friendly. We all enjoyed our time here.\n\nI don't think Tennessee Brew Works has dedicated parking. We parked for free on the street (Middleton Street because we also went to Third Man Records).

It's managed by the city's Parks & Rec department. This is a great sightseeing spot in Philly. I recommend it. The views are beautiful.\n\nSome quick Q&A:\n\n1. Why is it called Logan Circle?\n\nBecause it serves as a major traffic circle for Benjamin Franklin Parkway (https://www.yelp.com/biz/ben-franklin-parkway-philadelphia), connecting it to North 19th Street, Vine Street, and Race Street.\n\n2. Why is it called Logan Square?\n\nBecause it was one of five squares originally planned for the city in 1864 by William Penn, founder of Pennsylvania.\n\n3. Who is the circle/square named after?\n\nJames Logan, 14th mayor of Philadelphia.\n\nLogan Circle is actually surrounded by three other parks: Aviator Park, Sister Cities Park, and Shakespeare Park (small). Combined, the land area for these four parks, including the roads (Benjamin Franklin Parkway is wide and scenic) is about four city blocks. So for a city park, it's not huge, but not small neither.\n\nThe highlight of Logan Circle is a large fountain in the center called the Swann Memorial Fountain: https://www.yelp.com/biz/swann-memorial-fountain-philadelphia-2. We visited on a bright and sunny Sunday afternoon and the park was filled with people, both locals and tourists. Even though there were signs that said no swimming in the fountain, I can't tell you how many kids I saw swimming and playing in the fountain. A lot. It almost looked more like a pool or water park than a historic fountain.\n\nLogan Circle is centrally-located between Philadelphia City Hall and the Philadelphia Museum of Art (Rocky Steps: https://www.yelp.com/biz/rocky-steps-philadelphia). Benjamin Franklin Parkway connects all of it. If you've never been to Philly before and want to sight-see, I think walking the parkway between city hall and the museum is a must. Including the aforementioned adjacent parks, Logan Circle is surrounded by sights and attractions including the Franklin Institute, the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University, and the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul.\n\nNote: At the time of writing this review, there's another Yelp listing for Logan Circle. It's called Logan Square Park: https://www.yelp.com/biz/logan-square-park-philadelphia.

I purchased my old Google Pixel phone from the Google Store (online). One of the options I could add to my phone was Device Protection for $99. Device protection is the same thing as phone insurance and Assurant was the provider.\n\nThe coverage I purchased was good for two years from the date I received my phone. The maximum number of accidental damage repairs or replacements under Device Protection was two during the coverage period. My Pixel's camera lenses, both front and back, got scratched. The scratches caused light streaks in my photos and videos so I decided to file a claim and get a replacement.\n\nPer the Device Protection welcome and terms and conditions email I got from Assurant, I filed my claim at https://mydeviceprotect.com/. It was really quick and easy to do, especially since Assurant had most of my information on file from my phone's IMEI/serial number. I filed my claim on a Friday night. In less than 24 hours, someone from Assurant called to verify my information and approve my claim. I received a claim approval email after the call and a shipping notification that Monday (first business day after my claim was approved). I received my replacement Pixel on Tuesday afternoon; basically, in two business days. Fast!\n\nI did have to pay a $79 deductible, but it was totally worth it to me. It was like I got a brand new Pixel for only $178 ($99 for Device Protection + $79 deductible). Technically, the phone was refurbished, but it looked and worked like new - the battery too, which was huge, since my old battery was on its way out. Considering my particular phone model at the time, a 32-GB Pixel 1, originally retailed for $649, I thought this was a good deal. Plus, I had one more replacement remaining on my contract before my two years were up. It was nice to have that peace of mind.\n\nGoogle made it easy to transfer all of my apps and data from my old Pixel to my new Pixel. I just connected the two phones with a USB-C cable and followed the prompts. The entire transfer took about an hour (my new Pixel had to download and install almost 100 apps). I was really pleased with how simple and seamless the transition was. My old phone was essentially mirrored to my new one which was exactly what I wanted. I did have to set up new fingerprint recognition and log in to all of my apps again, but that was it. I was back up and running with a \"new\" phone with hardly any interruption.\n\nI returned my old Pixel in the same packaging that my new Pixel came in. Assurant emailed me a shipping label to print and tape to the outside of the box. I had to return my old Pixel within 14 days from the date my new Pixel was shipped. Otherwise, I could've been charged an \"unrecovered equipment fee\" of up to $2,000.\n\nIn the end, I am very happy with the Device Protection I purchased from Assurant. I already bought it again for my latest phone, the Pixel 3, for $129 (unsurprisingly, the insurance price went up).", "date": "2019-02-03 16:24:22"}, {"_key": "679931", "_id": "reviews/679931", "_rev": "_fNysUCq--h", "review_id": "xNTO7hUoAIx9I2uL0s8K-g", "user_id": "j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "business_id": "pCmaISSyKum22MOtPOxL-w", "stars": 3, "useful": 10, "funny": 3, "cool": 8, "text": "The Philadelphia Phillies are one of the oldest American professional sports franchises, established in 1883. Unlike other storied teams, the Fightin' Phils have never left their original city.\n\nIt took nearly 100 years, but the Phillies were able to win their first World Series championship in 1980 and then again, 28 years later, in 2008. In 1980, future Hall-of-Famer and perhaps the greatest third baseman of all time, Mike Schmidt, led Philadelphia to a 4-2 series win over the Kansas City Royals. In 2008, four-time All-Star pitcher Cole Hamels led Philly in a dominating series performance over the Tampa Bay Rays, 4-1. (Since 2020, Hamels has played for my favorite team, the Atlanta Braves.)\n\nThe Phillies play at Citizens Bank Park, located in South Philly. The ballpark opened in 2004 and is part of the South Philadelphia Sports Complex which includes the adjacent Lincoln Financial Field (home of the NFL's Philadelphia Eagles) and Wells Fargo Center (home of the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers). You can see the complex from the interstate (I-95) as you drive into the city from the airport. It's just across the Delaware River from New Jersey.\n\nThe Phillies haven't done well since 2011, the last year they made the playoffs. From 2012 to present, they've yet to finish a single season above .500 (they finished at exactly .500 twice, in 2012 and 2019), a far cry from their 2008 championship. However, the Charlie Manuel (manager) years (2005-2013), immediately preceding the current playoff drought, comprise a great era in Philadelphia's baseball history. Under Manuel, the Phillies made the playoffs five straight seasons (including that '08 World Series title), had first baseman Ryan Howard named NL Rookie of the Year in 2005 and then NL MVP the following year in 2006, shortstop Jimmy Rollins named NL MVP in 2007, and pitcher Roy Halladay named NL Cy Young Award winner in 2010. Unfortunately, the team hasn't been the same since Manuel's firing during the 2013 season.\n\nAt the time of writing this review, the Phillies have an all-time win percentage of .472 (9,853 wins against 11,032 losses).", "date": "2021-02-12 20:10:07"}, {"_key": "747073", "_id": "reviews/747073", "_rev": "_fNysV9W--V", "review_id": "Ez_VZ6uSsna2r9tGKbWbKA", "user_id": "j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "business_id": "TgbI5_wXWa82NBVwkvC0yQ", "stars": 4, "useful": 5, "funny": 1, "cool": 3, "text": "We stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott Philadelphia Plymouth Meeting and really enjoyed our stay. Everyone at the hotel seemed nice, especially Kim, the lady who checked us in. Kim set the tone and was really welcoming and affable. The hotel and amenities were nice considering the tier of hotel and price paid. We were part of a wedding block and were charged $119.90 per night after taxes. Not bad.\n\nIf you're not familiar with Philadelphia, this hotel is located in the suburbs northwest of town. There's plenty of free parking and the hotel is located within walking distance of a big shopping mall, Plymouth Meeting Mall, that is anchored in part by a Whole Foods. Aside from the mall, if you don't have a car, you're going to have to Lyft/Uber to get anywhere.\n\nThis Courtyard by Marriott is four stories. Our room was 335 on the 3rd floor. It was a \"KSOF\" (king with sofa bed) room with a view of the parking lot and office building to the north. The hotel is surrounded by several office buildings so I suspect a lot of business travelers stay here to work at those buildings.\n\nFrom the outside, the hotel looks like your standard Courtyard by Marriott. Inside, it looks like some renovation work has been done. The place was clean and looked fairly modern. While there's no full-service restaurant or shop, there is a fast-casual counter where you can order made-to-order food and drinks, a small retail corner with grab-and-go items, some dining and lounge-like areas, and a business center of sorts. There's also an indoor pool, hot tub, and gym. The gym is tiny. Outside in the back is a little courtyard with nice landscaping and additional seating. It's worth exploring and checking out.\n\nWhen we checked in, Kim handed us two bottles of water and two Peanut Chews, delicious candy bars that are manufactured in Pennsylvania.\n\nOur room was clean and comfy, and contemporary in design. The toiletries, such as the shampoo, conditioner, and body wash, were Paul Mitchell Tea Tree brand. The bathroom had a standard tub and shower with a floor that was tastefully tiled. The bed was very comfortable, from the soft-yet-firm mattress to the silky-smooth and smell-good sheets. There was an artsy-looking couch (sofa bed) with a conveniently-angled end table. The office desk was extendable which was great for more surface space. The TV was a smart TV with apps like Netflix and YouTube installed. There was a coffee maker, iron and ironing board, luggage rack, and hair dryer. The Wi-Fi was free and fast enough. And there was free, self-serve, tasty coffee and fruit-flavored ice water in the lobby.\n\nStandard check-in time is 3pm and check-out is 12pm. I used the Marriott Bonvoy app to keep track of my reservation and make an early check-in (12pm) request. The hotel (Kim) was quick to respond to my chat messages in the app and she remembered me from our chat conversation when I showed up in person to check-in. I like how they stay on top of that. Saturday night, when the lobby was used for the wedding after-party, I called in a request for additional toiletries and housekeeping was reasonably quick to respond despite the craziness going on downstairs. I appreciated that.\n\nOverall, I think this is a very good mid-tier hotel.

The Flyers won back-to-back Stanley Cups in 1974 and 1975. The team's number of championships (2) is tied for 11th best in the league. Historically, the Flyers have been a perennial playoff team. All time, the team ranks in the top 10 in total playoff seasons. However, over the last decade, the Flyers have only made the playoffs on average about every other year. All things considered, Philadelphia has been home to one of the NHL's better-performing franchises.\n\nThe Flyers are among the NHL's second-oldest members. They were part of the second wave of franchises that joined during the league's 1967 expansion. That expansion saw the league size double from six teams (the Original Six) to 12 teams. Of the 1967 expansion teams, Philadelphia was the first to win the Stanley Cup. Another 1967 expansion team, the in-state rival Pittsburgh Penguins, have won the Stanley Cup five times (the most of any of the expansion teams from that year). After winning back-to-back titles in 1974 and 1975, the Flyers went on to appear in six more Stanley Cup Finals, the latest in 2010.\n\nFour of the Flyers' six retired jersey numbers belong to players who won the Stanley Cup. They include goaltender Bernie Parent, defenseman Barry Ashbee, left-winger Bill Barber, and center Bobby Clarke. Parent is a legend among goalies and a Philadelphia sports icon. Clarke was the captain of both teams that won the Stanley Cup. Parent, Barber, and Clarke were all inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. Ashbee was a member of the 1974 championship team, but his career was unfortunately cut short from an eye injury he suffered in the Flyers' series preceding the Stanley Cup Finals. Tragically, only about three years later, Ashbee passed away from leukemia at age 37.\n\nThe Flyers' home arena is the Wells Fargo Center. With a present seating capacity of 19,600 (the number can vary depending on where you look; 19,600 is from the Wells Fargo Center website), the Wells Fargo Center is the fourth-biggest arena in the NHL. The Flyers and the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers have been the building's only two full-time occupants since the building opened in 1996. The seating capacity for Sixers games is slightly larger at 21,000. Wells Fargo Center is part of the South Philadelphia Sports Complex which includes Lincoln Financial Field (Philadelphia Eagles; NFL) and Citizens Bank Park (Philadelphia Phillies; MLB).\n\n#AnytimeAnywhere", "date": "2021-07-28 13:55:17"}, {"_key": "824251", "_id": "reviews/824251", "_rev": "_fNysYgy--H", "review_id": "YOp7ftuc3Biiuj4I9n9Mgg", "user_id": "j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "business_id": "Jio1vxVDY7qzNR5tVQj2lQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 6, "funny": 1, "cool": 5, "text": "I'm rating the Edmonton Oilers five stars based on their dominance from 1983 to 1990. Sadly, Edmonton has only made the playoffs twice since losing to the Carolina Hurricanes in a heartbreaking Game 7 in the 2006 Stanley Cup Finals. However, their history in the 80s cannot be denied. The Oilers won the Cup five times in seven years: 1984, 1985, 1987, 1988, and 1990. To date, the Oilers are tied with the Pittsburgh Penguins for the sixth-most number of Stanley Cup championships. The Oilers and the Penguins have the most NHL titles outside of the Original Six. A finer point, the Oilers franchise did not join the NHL until 1979 while the Penguins were part of the league's 1967 expansion. It's impressive how many championships Edmonton racked up after being a member of the NHL for only about a decade.\n\n\"The Great One\" Wayne Gretzky, started his NHL career with Edmonton. He is the franchise's all-time scoring leader in both goals (583) and points (1,669). Unlike many of the great hockey players today, Gretzky was not drafted. He played in the now-defunct World Hockey Association (WHA) for Edmonton for one season before the WHA folded. After that, the Oilers joined the NHL and the rest is history. Gretzky won all four of his Stanley Cups with Edmonton. He left the team in 1988 when he was traded by the Oilers to the Los Angeles Kings. The Oilers would go on to win the following Stanley Cup without him and Gretzky would never win another Cup again.\n\nToday, Connor McDavid is the Oilers' best player. He's currently considered one of the best players in hockey. Edmonton drafted him with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft. Already, McDavid has won the Hart Memorial Trophy (NHL regular season MVP in 2017; Gretzky won the Hart Trophy nine times), the Ted Lindsay Award twice (NHL regular season most outstanding player in 2017 and 2018), and the Art Ross Trophy twice (NHL regular season most points in 2017 and 2018). He was also on the cover of EA Sports NHL 18. He's quickly climbing up in the franchise record books.\n\nThe Oilers' current home is Rogers Place, located in downtown Edmonton. Opened in 2016, Rogers Place is one of the NHL's newest arenas. It has over 1,250 TV screens and the largest HD center ice scoreboard in the league. For hockey, Rogers Place has a seating capacity of 18,347. The Edmonton Oil Kings of the Western Hockey League (WHL) have also called Rogers Place home since 2016.

It's located just one block away from Philadelphia City Hall and is adjacent to the very popular Reading Terminal Market, so it's convenient to other must-see spots in the city.\n\nBy my count, Chinatown takes up about 21 city blocks. The Pennsylvania Convention Center takes up roughly a quarter of the neighborhood. Like other Chinatowns in big American cities, Philly's Chinatown is relatively old and densely-packed. Food is a big draw, of course, with restaurants serving not only Chinese food like dim sum and Peking duck, but also Japanese ramen and yakitori, Korean fried chicken, Malaysian, Thai, and Vietnamese cuisine, and vegetarian food. There are also Asian bakeries and bubble tea galore.\n\nThe official entrance to Chinatown is located on the south side of the neighborhood on N 10th St at Arch St. The gate is known as the Friendship Gate or Friendship Arch (https://www.yelp.com/biz/chinatown-friendship-gate-philadelphia). It's a vehicular gate and, ironically, traffic flows only one-way: out of Chinatown. N 10th St is also home to the Chinese Cultural & Community Center as well as the Mandarin-language campus of the Chinese Christian Church & Center (https://www.yelp.com/biz/chinese-christian-church-and-center-philadelphia-2).\n\nI attended a wedding at the church's Vine Campus which is less than a five-minute walk away. Vine St forms Chinatown's north border with N Broad St to the west, N 7th St to the east, and Arch St to the south. The neighborhood immediately north of Chinatown, Callowhill, is referred to by many as Chinatown North. The Asian Arts Initiative, a non-profit community and arts center, is located there (https://www.yelp.com/biz/asian-arts-initiative-philadelphia).\n\nIf you want to sight-see and explore Chinatown, N 10th St at Race St is a good place to start.

This is my first review of a gate.\n\nThe Chinatown Friendship Gate, also known as the Chinatown Friendship Arch and the China Gate, is the \"official\" entrance to Philadelphia's Chinatown. The gate is located on N 10th St at Arch St. It's 40 feet tall and weighs 88 tons. It's called the Friendship Gate because it symbolizes the friendship between Philly and its sister city in China, Tianjin. The gate officially \"opened\" (was dedicated) in January 1984 with a rededication in 2008.\n\nThis is a neat landmark and worth checking out if you've never been to Philly Chinatown before. It's ornate and colorful and makes for a nice photo/selfie. The architectural style comes from the Ming (1368 to 1644) and Qing (1644 to 1912) dynasties. I think Philly's Chinatown gate trumps San Francisco's Chinatown gate, Dragon Gate (http://bit.ly/2Yy21uu), in terms of size and decor, but SF's gate is actually three gates in one (two gates for pedestrians and one for vehicles). This gate is built over vehicular traffic only: two one-way car lanes and one one-way bike lane, all heading south out of Chinatown and into Center City.\n\nIf you're visiting Philly from out of town, I recommend going to Tea Do (http://bit.ly/2M9XSWV) one block north of the gate and Reading Terminal Market (http://bit.ly/2OOoUFG) two blocks east.\n\nAfter leaving a review for this gate, I realized I never left one for the SF version (http://bit.ly/2Yy21uu).

The restaurant is known for their charbroiled oysters which were created by Drago Cvitanovich himself.  The oysters are prepared with garlic, parsley, butter, black pepper, and two cheeses.  I ordered a dozen of these, but only received 10.  After letting the server know, he (eventually) brought out three additional oysters.\n\nThe charbroiled oysters were hot off the grill, very buttery, and quite tasty.  However, many of the oysters were quite small (the key to good charbroiled oysters is to use big fat oysters).  At $16.95 for one dozen, it may not have been worth it.\n\nWe also tried to order raw oysters of which they had none.  Our server tried to explain to us why they did not have raw oysters and all we could surmise from his explanation was that there were not a sufficient number of oyster boats due to the BP oil spill, but he also mentioned something about a one-hour refrigeration time, so it left us a bit confused.  Oh well.  No raw oysters = bad.\n\nDrago's serves higher-end Creole cuisine and also specializes in a variety of lobster dishes.  The restaurant is located at the ground level of the Hilton.  They do not take reservations (first-come, first-serve only).  The restaurant is popular and thus service can be slow.

It was sooo unbelievably uncomfortable.  \n\nI felt bad, because my bf gave me the massage as one of my birthday gifts, and instead of leaving the salon relaxed and refreshed, I felt even more tense and stressed from clenching my butt cheeks every time her hand grazed and caressed it. When it was over, I couldn't get to the exit FAST ENOUGH!! lol. To add insult to injury, she had the nerve to hand me an empty envelope, indicating that she was expecting to get a tip.  Well, I ended up tipping her a few dollars, because in the end, I usually DO tip people when I receive any kind of service. Trust me, I would have rather kept that money in my wallet. \n\nI understand that for some people, the butt massage is no big deal, but I would have preferred to be asked. Don't just grab it and HAVE AT IT without my permission. This experience has me so jaded, that I doubt I will ever go to a spa for a massage again. I'll stick to Massage Envy and places in the mall. They do a better job anyway and for much less money.\n\nOh, and forget about trying to get an appointment here. It took me two weeks to get mine, because no one answered the phone during business hours, and then when you leave a message, no one calls you back!\n\nDo yourself a favor, don't go to Total Serenity for a massage.

A conference center and hotel, Gaylord Opryland offers ample walking paths, multiple restaurants, a river boat ride, a salon and spa, and now a water park as well. It is quite the labyrinth and is easy to get lost despite the signposts peppered throughout, although this often makes for the best exploration. While the hotel isn't located in the heart of downtown Nashville, it isn't a terribly far drive either.\n\nTaking a stroll through the atriums is like being in a tropical oasis. There are multiple waterfalls, streams, and lush foliage. While I have no idea what any of it has to do with Nashville itself or its history, it is quite lovely. The strategically placed oversized guitars feel a bit out of place, and yet seem more authentic to the local flavor. Compared to Gaylord Palms in Orlando which actually has decor centered around Florida (Evergaldes, Key West, and Saint Augustine), I felt less of the connection to the city here. However, I can't deny that the hotel is still quite picturesque. Visit around Christmas, and the entire hotel is bedecked in holly and strings of twinkling lights as well.\n\nLike any major hotel,\u00a0Gaylord Opryland\u00a0\u00a0comes with its pros and cons. The parking is high on my annoyance list, because although it is ample, it is pretty steep extra on top of the cost of your actual room. Whether\u00a0you are a short term visitor, or a hotel guest, expect to pay around\u00a0$32 a day.\u00a0Also the restaurants are plentiful (think Italian, Mexican, sushi, and a grill), but none are particularly great. They do have Starbucks on premises if you are short on time, but walk or drive across the street to\u00a0Nashville Coffees\u00a0for a better selection and more interesting options.\n\nIf you are staying on business or at the hotel for a conference, the conference center is massive and quite convenient. There is more than enough space for an exhibition hall and smaller rooms for more intimate talks. WiFi is available throughout the area if you need to sneak away to get work done on your laptop. Speaking of the WiFi, you can also connect throughout the grounds or in the hotel rooms, and they have a direct wired connection if you need something faster, which makes a better choice if you need to connect to a VPN or are on a call.\n\nThe rooms themselves are comfortable, although certainly some sections are better than others. For example, a room in Magnolia may have you in a fairly basic look (your standard outdated hotel) and a view of a courtyard/pool, whereas in Delta the rooms seem to be a bit more modern, and if you're lucky you can get a view of one of the domed areas, which makes for great people watching.\n\nWorth visiting at least once, even if you aren't a hotel guest!

Other varietals include adjuncts ranging from vanilla beans to maple syrup to raspberries.

For those unfamiliar with meads, or those just wanting to try more of their masterful libations, I highly suggest grabbing a flight.

Where did the baby end up?  In the aisle, in the same 'fire hazard' manner as before.  Whatever.  Let's freaking eat, I'm starving.\n\nI ask the waiter for the lunch menu, as it was almost 11, and I don't like breakfast foods.  He says that most of the food won't be ready, as they hadn't prepped the vegetables.  Really?  It's nearly 11 AM!  You're a diner!  Anyway, he says he'll bring the lunch menu, then never returns.  When he does, the wife and I want Bloody Marys.  We order, they come out, and I ask for the lunch menu again.  He says he'll get it.  We wait longer.  He comes back and takes the order from Meg's sister and her fiancee, then asks me what I want.  I tell him that I want the lunch menu.  Now, he's got to go find one, which took another give minutes.  It's almost 11:30, at this point.  It finally comes, and I have three seconds to look over the menu before he bails on us again.  I order a chicken club sandwich.  It was terrible.  At least my bloody mary was good.\n\nWhat I'm more annoyed about, and marking them down big time for, was the fact that they couldn't accommodate four adults with an infant, and we were hassled because we were a fire hazard.

My primary concern is that when I spoke directly with the person at reception about having the repairs done, she neglected to tell me that there was a problem and that she needed additional information. Instead she told me everything was all set. I think she was overwhelmed and just wanted to move on to the next waiting person.  A week later, after having been told the car was completely repaired, I went to pick it up to find only half the work done - and, had to find this out myself.

We got a drink at Harry The K's the restaurant in left field named after Hall of Fame broadcaster Harry Kalas. You can sit and watch the full game there as long as you keep buying. We watched the Phillies batting practice and walked around the park as it opened.

It also wouldn't be Philly without a replica Liberty Bell.  It \"rings\" and lights up after Philly home runs and wins. Unfortunately, we didn't see either. The Nats won. Another Philadelphia quirk is that their bullpens are in the outfield amongst the fans. When they first opened in 2004 the Phillies bullpen was closest to the fans and after Philly fans booed their own pitchers (these are the same fans that booed Santa Claus) they switched to have the visitors section closer for heckling.\n\nThe mascot always needs mentioning.

I knew that.  Neither was Rotier's.  But my handy Yelp app had assured me that Fido's was open.  Imagine the disappointment when I realized there was a very real possibility that no burgers would happen on this trip down to the Deep South.  Would I really have to wait two more weeks when I would find solace in East Texas?   \n\n\"We can try Burger up,\" I mentioned.  \n\n\"Why don't you just call them?\" hissed the appropriately nicknamed Viper.  \n\nTrue.  We didn't have to keep driving around aimlessly.  So I call Burger Up, and a very pleasant, sweet voice assures me they are indeed open.  \n\nViper: \"What was her name?  She sounded hot.\"\n  \nMe: \"Paige.\"\n\nViper: \"Yeah, she's definitely hot.  Have you ever met an unattractive Paige?\"\n\nMe: \"Good point.  At least we have that going for us.\"\n\nPaige was indeed attractive, but this review isn't about a photogenic individual who happens to work at Burger Up.  It's about what ended up being a visit to our fourth choice for burgers in Nashville.  \n\nBurger Up follows a national trend towards upscale burgers.  My particular order consisted of a medium rare patty served with aged cheddar, Benton's bacon (very good), and ketchup served on an artisan bun.  Basically, it was a gussied up bacon cheeseburger, but it was a rather tasty one.  My major complaint is that I wish the actual meat itself exhibited more flavor.  Having said that, the burger was cooked properly and the flavors worked well together.  I ordered some wilted spinach on the side (mediocre) and truffle fries.  Let's talk about those truffle fries for a bit.  I know more people are apparently into the sweet potato fries here, but I think they are missing the boat.  Burger Up's truffle tries have pleasant aroma, taste great, and are the perfect texture for soaking up oil.  If you are on a diet, it is true you should skip these delightful fries.  But if that were the case, why are you at a burger joint in the first place?  Seriously, if you get nothing else out of my review, please do yourself a favor and order the truffle fries.  \n\nBurger Up also boast an interesting beer menu with semi-obscure breweries from the Deep South included in the list.  I tried a pecan-infused amber from Mississippi - not bad.  I could imagine Burger Up could be a decent place to drink for a bit after eating.  \n\nIf I attended Vanderbilt, I would probably go here on a moderately frequent basis.

That cheese!\n\nDinner: Burger - medium, cheddar, bacon, awesome. 2 can split it. The bbq Pork looked wonderful, too, and when I looked at my friends' plates, they were clean. It was gone in, like, 1 1/2 minutes.\n\nDessert: We got to try all three desserts. The Irish Car Bomb was good, kind of like a wet cake, though. The Shortcake was good, with a mix of strawberry/rhubarb, though you couldn't taste much rhubarb in it. On the side of that was a buttermilk sorbet which really impressed me. The winner of best dessert, though, is the 'Nutter Shake. I've never had such a milkshake - so many flavors, thick, and with a bite-sized blondie on the side. Blondies melt me.\n\nI would give it 5 stars, if it weren't so pricey.\n\nThe decor is outstanding, as all of Jose's places are. I love a great-looking old-timey-looking bar. Very classy. Wish I could go more, but this is no health food, and I'd have to save up.

Seriously I am not paying $6 for a small sized sno ball with a few pieces of fruit and ice cream on top.  RAWR\n\nThe inside of this place has become a hot mess.  There is crap everywhere.

Next, if you want to display extra things to sell (like nuts) find a tasteful way to do that.  FINALLY learn something about the product you're selling, I get the impression that the owner has no idea what this shaved ice thing is, doesn't know what to call it or how to talk about it, and it really makes her look incompetent.  How can you sell something if you don't know what it is!\n\n I also think she is trying to find new ways to make more money.  However, I think that if she did some research into what is is selling then maybe she could find a way to enhance the Asian theme rather than trying to turn it into a kitschy sandwich shop that also serves this ice thing that has fruit on it.  The design is modern, you aren't going to re-design the place then stop trying to put cute pigs and pottery bowls around that look better in your home.  GO WITH THE THEME.  If you don't know what the theme is, I'll help.  The theme is modern Asian.  What kind of music would you play in a modern Asian shaved ice/bubble tea place?  \n\nThese are my suggestions:\n1. Add more variety of things you can add to the shaved ice (red bean/coconut jelly/taro paste) AND come up with some signature combinations\n2. Consider adding more Asian snacks that most people would find different, but enjoy.  One of my favorites is the Hong Kong style egg waffles \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_waffle\n3. Add ice creams that compliment asian desserts (eg., coconut and green tea would be wonderful additions).\n4. COFFEE, some really good coffee would be an excellent addition.\n5.

Here, you can order any kind of frozen concoction you want because they have a wall of frozen drink machines glorious churning up the colorful sweet stuff. You might feel like a kid at buffet where you can mix & match Pepsi and Mt. Dew and even Dr. Pepper (I was that child once). They have all these varieties and then will do something outrageous like a Pi\u00f1a Colada/Hypnotiq parfait. I stuck to the classic pi\u00f1a and wow, it even tasted like it wasn't filled with that obvious artificial flavor that some daiquiri places typically use (Gene's version is not drinkable, I'm sorry). It's true that I normally shun the sweet boozy stuff but there's something about a hot New Orleans day and the way these days practically beg for frozen cocktails. I'm a believer now. And this is where I'll be getting my fix. Sunday fundays, here's looking at you! \n\nDespite not bringing an appetite, I wanted to try their veg black beans (perfection-- just the right texture and seasoning) and oh, I can never say no to homemade tortilla chips. So, yes, I ate. It's kind of impossible not to at Pelican Bay. Know that if you're a vegetarian there are options for you (and how cool is it that they have a separate fryer for veggies?) and they note what isn't vegan on the menu, too. When asked by chef/owner Tanzanika what they could do to make the menu more veg-friendly, I suggested having some tofu options, maybe (I just love tofu. I know it's crazy). She laughed but seems like she's open to the idea. It's not even really necessary and if you're open to dairy, they have pizzas that look really great, too. Their emphasis is on FRESH food and yes, they shop daily. My guy had a burger that he said tastes just like \"Mom's burger,\" which for him is a big compliment (for me, not so much. My mom's burgers possibly turned me off meat forever. Please don't tell her I mentioned it, K?)\n\nService is fantastic from the moment you open the door and are warmly welcomed.

Thanks to my born-again vegan status three years ago, though, I crossed leather off my list forevermore and although he has been known to have a vegan shoe or two in his repertoire, that stopped a while back. Ages ago, I used to justify buying leather shoes and honestly, there weren't many affordable quality non leather options out there. Not to mention the fact that I have weird small feet that are also wide, have very high arches and an annoyingly high instep. Many shoes just do not work for my feet. Especially cheap ones (ie typical non leather shoes that you might find at Payless, Target etc).\n#excuses\n\nSo yes. I was buying vogs like nobody's business because when they work for my feet, they really are pure bliss. They are gorgeous/quirky/cool and wearable. Then there are the outrageous super high ones that turn heads (the Malibu. I wore these to MOMS one year and I may have been sobbing in pain by the end of the night, but damn, I looked good). \n\nThe other day an email arrived from John Fluevog. Angels sang. Cartoon birds landed on my shoulders. The bright purple stretchy velvet over the knee boots, aka \"The Munchies\" are in fact vegan! I called the local store and was informed that they have them in stock. Ten minutes later, I arrived, tried on my usual size 6, though because they are pointy toed, I expected I'd need to go up a size. The 6 fit perfectly and because they are stretchy, they can accommodate a variety of calves; skinny to muscled to those with some heft. These boots are perfect for Mardi Gras... and for Prince tributes. \n\nJF, thank you for making my dreams come true.

The Moonrise gets an extra star for the vintage moon photos that are just about everywhere in the hotel. I think decor-wise, Moonrise is my favorite, beating out even the Hotel On Rivingon's sleek rock and roll blood red/black decor! I just love the theme to death!!  There are the cute touches like the voice in the elevator making it seem like you're taking off/landing, the way that it always feels like nighttime is falling in the public parts of the hotel, the stationary, pens, all of it.

I stepped onto the elevator feeling guilty about not being more pleasant.  I really hope that guy wasn't cleaning my room. I do have issues with male housekeeping staff. The very idea of it just creeps me out, especially when traveling alone.\n\nNoise, well, I'll be honest, there was a morning when people were talking way too much in the hall (step to the elevator, please!) and there was a night that I just couldn't sleep due to the crowd spilling out into the street (apparently the lobby has that disco after hours thing going on that the W has) and what was more annoying was the asshole in the room next to me who banged on the wall to indicate that I was talking too loudly on Skype.

Their employees are nice without making you feel like you've committed a sin by asking for plastic (to be fair, the cashiers at WF aren't nearly as self-righteous as the floor staff who seem like they'd spit on you if you ask for something that is against WF puredom, like artificial sweetener. Not that I'd ever ask for it, but a friend once had the audacity to do so and was met with a lecture).\n6. Kick ass olive bar\n7. They just have a lot more grocery items, and more affordable options at that\n8. Not everything has to be gourmet specialty foods and products. They have those, but sometimes you want a bag of Zapps chips or a harsh cleaning product for eff's sake!\n9. Nowhere nearly as pretentious (for example, you probably don't notice, but WF has plenty of produce that's from Mexico, California and other places).  \n10. Aeroponic rooftop garden!

The oils area is confusing not only to shoppers but to employees as well. I had three different employees attempt to find me a vessel in which to pour truffle oil from the jug thingamajig and no one could help me. Not their fault as apparently they had just changed all that around, but no one clued the staff in. \n2. There's just not enough organic produce. It would be ideal as well, if the organic stuff wasn't all mixed in with the other stuff.\n3. Not enough produce in general (uh, dino kale shouldn't be that rare).\n4. Lack of gourmet whole bean coffee\n\n\nNumbers 2-4 have double weight, as I'm all about the organic produce selection. A fine whole bean coffee i(extremely dark roast that I grind myself) is what gets me through a morning. I realize not everyone is as particular as me, but there you have it. Supermarket shopping is painful enough, I'd rather not have to go to more than one store per week.\n\nOther things to note:\n\n-gourmet and deli sections in this Rouses is really outstanding and similar to WF. I didn't check out the prepared food section too much, so I can't report on that just yet. \n-the staff really did go out of their way to find me an oil vessel. \n-that wine selection blows WF's out of the water\n\nExpect review updates!", "date": "2013-02-27 21:25:05"}, {"_key": "1125675", "_id": "reviews/1125675", "_rev": "_fNyr2pm---", "review_id": "8gty-0RzIN0N9aXFzljVYw", "user_id": "0G-QF457q_0Z_jKqh6xWiA", "business_id": "SDhiF9UG0gsuaXgCnJR-sQ", "stars": 4, "useful": 12, "funny": 4, "cool": 5, "text": "Give me liberty or give me death!

I ordered a Bloody Mary, figuring it had to be top notch there and oh yes, it was. There was a hint of an usual spice in there (I'm thinking allspice) that didn't overpower it, but made it extra tasty. I believe they pickle their own green beans too, which may be the reason I was tasting the all spice. If the Bloody Mary is the most complex cocktail, then the bartenders at Maurepas are surely at Mensa level. \n\nThe menu is divided into 2 sections grains, vegetables, and starch and then meat and fish. Note that several of the dishes may be in the first category but are not vegetarian, however, Danielle offered up suggestions and said they'd alter things to make them so.  \n\nThe soba noodles in hot broth (made from andouille, but you can get it made with veg-based broth) was just what I needed on this frigid day.

I've also booked several of my colleagues at the Mazarin when they've come to New Orleans and heard good things from them (as recently as January 2015).\n\nSo when looking to book a hotel for a work conference 10 people I was leading, Hotel Mazarin was at the top of my list. And when you realize that in other local hotels you're probably going to get that New Orleans jenk known as \"charm\"  for a similar price, I will absolutely recommend Hotel Mazarin for being immaculate (with one tiny exception in my bathroom, but I'm insane), amenities (almost Westin-quality beds, flatscreen TVs), and the restrained modern baroque decor (gold fixtures, marble floors). If you're a breakfast-lover, you cannot beat that deluxe complimentary breakfast (eggs & bacon, pastry, toast, cereal, juices). Seriously, I've stayed in New Orleans hotels with TVs straight out of the 90s, ancient (as in, not antique) beds, dated decor and questionable levels of cleanliness. I won't name names (search my reviews if you must). But Hotel Mazarin boasts higher standards. \n\nThat said, my colleagues and I had some issues during our stay last month that should be noted. \n\n-multiple reports of the front desk/reception staff being aloof and often downright surly (unacceptable and so not typical of the superb hospitality that is the custom of New Orleans. I'm honestly scratching my head over this one). One of my people was reprimanded for putting a room card/key in her wallet when she came down to report that her keys weren't working (she never put it in her wallet but even if she had?!) When she explained that she had done no such thing, the response from the desk was an eye roll. Another colleague called the desk to report that his room was noisy. With a week of late nights and early mornings ahead of him, he thought he could request a quieter room. He was informed that he was in a quiet room. That's it. No apologies or explanations. I can write more, but in the interest of space, I leave it at these two instances. \n\nHowever, all of the other hotel staff were great, from management to catering (special props to the lovely Mary who took care of our conference room. She is a gem!) Everyone in the breakfast room and in catering were ALL so lovely and friendly (everyone says good morning and the catering manager walked around talking to everyone, making sure they were having a great stay). \n\n-the showers are extremely tricky to work and some of us didn't have anything hotter than lukewarm water. This is horrible to deal with first thing in the morning on one of the coldest weeks in New Orleans. I live here and I know the city's water pressure leaves a lot to be desired, especially in old French Quarter buildings, but this isn't OK in a hotel. Apparently there was some trick to get it to work and I can't even tell you what that is, because it's really *that* tricky. There should be instructions posted, unless this was a fluke with half of my colleagues' rooms. \n\n-catering: although the food is good, it's extremely overpriced for what you get. You are not allowed to bring in outside food, so if you're using their conference room you're going to have to use these services. I know this is common practice in hotel conference rooms, so although I won't fault them for this, next year I'll try and find an alternative.\n\nRelated to this: when setting up my catering order, I specified that three of my group had dietary restrictions/extreme food allergies. For the very expensive muffaletta sandwiches, I thought they'd at least offer a GF bread option for one or two of them for my G/F colleague, but no. Second, I was told the king cake would be nut free and it was not. Suddenly I saw one of my colleagues leaving the room in the middle of a session and I later learned that he had to go up to his room and take an emergency Benadryl. If he hadn't, he likely would have needed to go to the hospital, for his nut allergy is that extreme. If I put on my request that at least one dessert should be nut free and the only other dessert item is pralines, the cooks should pay attention and not put nuts on the king cake. Pretty simple. Attention to detail is crucial. Again, when you're paying extremely high prices for catering, high expectations should be met.\n\nI would still recommend Hotel Mazarin thanks to its amazing location for visitors to our city, as well as the nice perks, including two comped drinks at the fabulous 21st Amendment Bar.

Where there were once specific streets or neighborhoods that were known to be great for vintage shopping in any given city, that's no longer the case in cities like New Orleans or New York. I look at the 50+ dresses that are in my closet, mainly from the 20s through the early 60s. It's discouraging to note that even though I don't really even wear them anymore, they are slowly but surely disintegrating (especially my 1920s and 30s numbers). What was once a fine silk frock is now reduced to spiderweb thread-bare on the seams, shoulders and anywhere there's the slightest bit of friction. Evil moths have attacked cashmere sweaters (they sure do have good taste, as they leave alone the cheap cotton numbers) leaving them beyond repair.\n\nBut I don't mean to depress you. There's Blue Dream, restoring my faith in vintage. I looked through well-kept racks of dresses, men's shirts, jeans and accessories and was quite impressed.

New Orleans now has a fabulous Tiki bar, with just the right dark Polynesian atmosphere that's straight outta Trader Vics circa 1965. My mom would always regale me with stories about her times at Hawaii Kai in Manhattan in the 60s. As a child, I'd cherish our annual trips to Mai Kai in Fort Lauderdale (which still exists, apparently!) Fun fact: About 5 years ago, I was a featured bartender in Inked Magazine where I talk about making Tiki drinks (you can see the photo in my profile), as I worked in a Tiki bar in NYC (Waikiki Wally's RIP).\n\nSo, yeah. I'm a lover all things Tiki, though I have to admit, I hate loathe and despise sweet drinks for obvious reasons, but hell, it's a Yelp review so I'll just come out and say it: usually sweet drinks mask cheap liquor. Usually sweet drinks are meant for people who aren't drinkers and can't stand the taste of alcohol. And last but certainly not least, sweet drinks mean for inevitable hangover. I pride myself on being a veteran drinker and at most, get one hangover a year. In fact, my year anniversary of my last hangover is coming up. July 4. \n\nThe fabulous thing is, Tiki Tolteca offers up *craft* Tiki drinks. Yes, you're reading that correctly. Look at my menu photos that detail the ingredients! They even offer up little stories with each drink. Their cocktails don't only feature rum, but such lovely spirits as my beloved Mezcal, and my much less beloved ca\u00e7aca. I settled on a Hemingway Daiquiri, which is frozen and perfect because it's not a fruit daiquiri, so not filled with artificial nonsense, just lime, rum, & maraschino liqueur. And potent, seeing as I was feeling a nice buzz after two.\n\nThey also have a menu feature small plates with a tropical flavor. DO NOT PASS UP THAT CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE DESSERT. The Tiki gods command it, too. Seriously. It really is the stuff of the gods. Chocolate, coconut, banana sauce... 'scuse me while I talk in tongues. I look forward to going back and trying the sweet corn tamales (vegetarian!). No crab rangoons, though, thankfully (created at Don the Beachcomber and now for some reason is expected on any given Chinese restaurant menu for some perplexing reason).\n\nOh!! Be sure and order a High Life, if you're so inclined, so you can get the full bottle service experience. This is no joke. They serve it in Champagne glasses and ice your bottle. Luckily my drinking partners indulged so I didn't have to.\n\nMore fun trivia. You may see in my profile that my current (and forever) crush is Howard Hughes. Apparently there's a tale of him drinking one too many zombies at Don the Beachcomber and then killed a pedestrian with his car. Bad Howie!! I hope it's not true.

FYI they also have thin crust if that is your thing. Typically, that is my thing, but when in St. Louis, one should do as the St. Louans (is that what they're called?) do. Although, I think St. Louis pizzas are traditionally cracker crust. Ah, there I go again. ANYWAY...\n\nIt was a beautiful spring day on Wednesday, so we sat outside and were immediately taken care of by our friendly waiter who brought us water and drinks (really good house iced tea that is infused with some kind of blossom). We were warned that the deep dish pizzas take 35 minutes to prepare, which was fine with us.\n\nIt was worth the wait. Holy delish, batgirl! I ordered kalamata olives and mushrooms on mine and the sauce to cheese ratio was just perfect. I love the sauce! Chunky tomato, not sweet. Mmmmmm mmmm good. And that crust was just awesome.

I think check-in should close a lot later than 6pm, after all, the opening bashes were all going on that night and without your tickets, you can't get in to them (or so I thought. Luckily I was able to get into both Better with Age and the Absolut opening party with my assistant's tickets since she had her media badge). Besides, with people coming in from all over at all times *and* it being that it's in a hotel, next year it would be nice to see extended check-in times.\n\nThat aside, I thoroughly enjoyed my lost week, I mean, incredibly fun-filled week at TOTC. From the volunteer staff who checked you in at each event and seminar (all of them incredibly nice) to the tasting rooms to the hotels and other types of event venues, all I can say is that I was left thoroughly impressed. There was just so much going on, it's impossible to catch everything. I paced myself rather well (time for a pat on the back). \n\nAnd that L'agniappe Lounge. WOW!!! This room, I believe, is only for media and other sponsors, but holy crap. All of the brands and sponsors left swag, product and other fun materials (favorite had to be the moleskine notebooks thanks to Tanqueray or Hennessey-- it's tastefully embossed into the cover). OH!!

The Diageo Happy Hour was fun because of the people I was with, however the food left a lot to be desired (do not bring a bread bowl around to hundreds of people to dip their hands into. Whose idea was that??)\n... not to mention that although there were master mixologists at the bars, they had to make due with the ingredients that were given to them (kind of like the \"Chopped\" for bartenders). I definitely preferred the vodka cocktails to any others.\n\nWhile the booze flowed freely, my tip to attendees is to make sure and pack some energy bars because this event is not about food, so don't expect any.

I had been drinking coffee all morning at the fabulous Park Avenue Coffee next door, but alas, a low fat blueberry muffin did not keep me sated for more than 3 hours, so come lunchtime, I checked Yelp and was overjoyed to see an Italian restaurant is located right next door. Especially because St. Louis is known to have some damn good Italian American food!\n\nI was seated by window without even asking. Bonus points again for first impressions here! The menu has a good amount of pasta dishes, but I was dazzled by the eggplant parmesan, as is typical for me. It's offered both as a small plate and as an entree (don't quote me on this, but I believe the full size portion is offered on a lunch special).\n\nMolto sadness: apparently due to the freeze in Mexico, there are no eggplants to be had, as I was told by the waitress. Soooo, if you were hoping to get locally sourced vegetables, well it ain't happening here (I know, I know... eggplant isn't in season in MO right now). I instead ordered the minestrone and penne tossed with garlic, oil and vegetables.\n\nThe Minestrone... I hate to say this, when I wanted to like a place so much (yes, that warm greeting really does go a long way), but it is possibly the worst I've ever had. I hate likening anything in a restaurant to store bought, but this is the stuff that Campbell's Alphabet soup is made of. Inexcusable in an Italian restaurant.\n\nOn to the main course: let's say it made up for the soup in droves. I quite possible inhaled this dish! Delicious pasta, crisp broccoli, fresh mushrooms with just the right amount of olive oil and garlic. Perfection.\n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant lends itself well to both a business lunch or a romantic dinner. There are two cozy dining rooms (you enter through the bar) and while it won't be winning any design awards, it's a familiar kind of scene that conjures up Italian American bistros across the US and I like this sort of thing. It's not garish with pink lighting and marble busts like Anthony's in Kansas City, and several notches above my beloved Milo's here in Saint Louis. \n\nI do think I'd return to Ricardo's when in the neighborhood.

The original was dark and red, where the new is drenched in lighter hues, but it's colorless as far as I can tell. The original was cozy and inviting (at least to the likes of me) with Victorian lamps and Soviet memorabilia everywhere. The new is rather devoid of any kind of signature style.

It's Louisiana-owned\n2. They have Cajun hot nuts\n3. Related to the above, they have an array of other NOLA specialty items (tourists, buy your foodie souvenirs here rather than the FQ)\n4. Kick ass olive bar (but just about as pricey as WF's)\n5. They just have a lot more grocery items, and more affordable options at that\n6. Not everything has to be gourmet specialty foods and products. They have those, but sometimes you want a bag of Zapps chips or a harsh cleaning product for eff's sake!\n7. Phenomenal wine/beer selection (see my note about hard liquor below).\n\nThere is no hydrophonic rooftop garden at this one, but that's OK. What they do have that the CBD Rouses doesn't have is a larger and easier to navigate produce section. That said, the organics are still seriously lacking. And what's with the tomatoes imported from Mexico? The store is bigger and there is less of that clusterfuck feeling that you'd expect in any supermarket smack dab in the middle of downtown. \n\nThe popcorn selection is bliss, by the way. An entire section of the snack aisle and I found those black and red popcorn types that promise all kinds of antioxidant benefits. I don't really care, though. I just wanted to buy black popcorn.\n\nOn a distressing note, I cannot believe there is an entire subcategory of Hot Pockets, as noted on the aisle sign (Ie the head category is Frozen and then below it, they have subcategories of normal stuff like pizza, vegetables, fruit etc.) I mean, Hot Pockets are a brand, not a type of food. Actually calling Hot Pockets \"food\" is also a stretch. Sorry, that's just my hatred of convenience foods shining through and has nothing to do with my star rating. But please, for the love of your body: Stop your Hot Pocket habit.\n\nOne thing that is really hella lame: what's with the separate counter for hard liquor? It's just terribly inconvenient and we actually skipped buying the bottle of vodka we had planned on buying because who wants to check out twice at the grocery store?\n\nI think of all the Rouses, my favorite is the one on Tchoupitoulas, followed by Mid-City and CBD at a tie.

It was a dark and stormy day...\n\n(yikes, that doesn't bode well. Neruda would never be prone to such clich\u00e9!)\n\nSo, let's just say that the overwhelming vibe of Il Posto is that of a rustic Italian cafe. Not unlike the cafe in the movie Il Postino. You may be overcome by the desire to just order shot after shot of espresso, but the sight and smells of the cafe's offerings will convince you to do otherwise.\n\nI admit I'm not at all a fan of half service. I prefer to sit down and order from a server, receive food from my server, ask them for whatever else I may need, and then tip them. It's the whole anxiety of \"will I get a seat after I order my food\" thing, plus the fact that I just want to be served. \n\nNow that that's out of the way, I'll just ignore all that, because Il Posto is worth that little annoyance.\n\nThe pastry on the counter is incredibly tempting. A bite of my friend's insanely moist and decadent carrot cupcake proved that they might all live up to their expectations. \n\nThe menu is on chalkboards above the bar. For near sighted people like me, this proves to be a bit challenging, though I understand that perhaps the menu changes frequently enough to demand it. I was undecided between a choice of two vegetarian panini and a cold sandwich with hummus, avocado and veggies on whole grain (this sounds like the perfect sandwich on a hot day).\n\nBut then I saw the antipasti and all bets were off. We split a cheese plate with all five cheeses they offer and then opted for a garden salad. The cheese plate is divine and has just the right amount of each variety, my favorites being the goat and Brie. The bread that comes with is irresistible and fresh, rather than the typical crostini. The garden salad was good, albeit not very exciting. My friend added avocado to hers and I think everyone should follow her example, though I doubt I'd order the same salad next time with all the other options.\n\nIt had been a trying afternoon.

Luckily I exhibit a fair degree of self control. The cruelest irony that ice cream season coincides with swimsuit season. WHATEV, right?\n\nSo, this is the best ice cream I have ever had. Want some cockamamie never-hear-of-before flavors (Green Fairy, anyone?) They've got that here. Die hard traditionalist? They've got you covered (anything from vanilla to butter pecan). Diabetic? There's both an ice cream and a special sundae for you. Can't have dairy? While I didn't see any soy or nut ice creams, they do have sorbet. On a diet? Well, then, I'm afraid you're SOL. There's a kiddie cup, but it's for the kids only. Their small cup *probably* won't kill you too much, though.\n\nFirst visit had me sampling my friend's choice: red velvet cake. While not a fan of red velvet cake, I can't deny this ice cream brings it to a whole new level. Instead of being merely red velvet flavored ice cream, it's got bits of red velvet cake throughout. Scream-worthy, right?\n\nSecond visit, I came with a mission: to try four flavors via the 4 scoop sample (you get 4 small scoops for $4. A bargain, no?) My choices: sweet corn with raspberry and black peppercorn, Green Fairy, butterscotch butter pecan, and blueberry pie, my favorites being the latter two, however I wouldn't throw the other two out of bed... I mean the bowl. Green Fairy wins the creative award because I'd never think to have absinthe-flavored ice cream! It also has bittersweet chocolate and orange peels, which make for a really tasty, unique concoction. My only issue is that I'm not a fan of chocolate bits in ice cream, otherwise, I'd be all over this. Butterscotch butter pecan brings a bit of a more intense, grown up twist to an old timey classic (I had to wonder if there's booze in it). Blueberry pie... sigh. Just perfect. I need a moment alone with it. Perhaps even a year. The sweet corn is a bit too overpowered by the peppercorns and could stand to have more raspberry, in my opinion. That's the *only* criticism I'd have. With all those flavor choices, who cares? Oh and feel free to sample if you're on the fence (but obey the sign: don't be a sample hog).\n\nThe best thing about this ice cream is that it's not crazy sweet. I realize that sounds ridiculous, but it's true. Take the salted caramel, for example (I know you will). I tried my friend's and was quite taken with it. I love the idea of salted caramel but I've had that flavor before at other places and found it sickeningly sweet- not at all salty. Creole Creamery has somehow managed to achieve just the right balance of flavor.\n\nAnd so, I bid Creole Creamery farewell... meaning in this review.

It really just tasted like absinthe. The lavender lace, OTOH, I could have drank all night. Champagne plus lavender? Oh hells yeah.\n\nMusic. What can I say? They book great stuff here.

A personal preference would be to have full table service, as I don't like ordering at the bar. Since they don't do separate checks, this requires one person from your party to go up and give in your entire order. It's just awkward if you're with more than one other person.

Yes, please!\n\nIt's so hard to settle on just one place for your big night, so my guy made the decision for me. That's nice for a change as you can imagine I'm always being asked to make the choices by friends and family.\n\nMy experience was again good, but not 5-star excellent, given the caliber of the restaurant. It was a Saturday night and the restaurant was reasonably filled, as it was Carnival season and getting close to the big day. My issue was with the lighting. I'm of the mind that at nighttime, unless you're at a diner or fast food joint (and that would be *never* for me), lights should be dimmed and the candles brought out. Not so at Muriel's. Some people hate dimly lit restaurants, so have at it if this is you! \n\nAnother thing, and this is more of a criticism of my fellow Americans than anything: Muriel's doesn't have dress requirements like some of our fancier joints in town, but really, when you go out to a *nice* restaurants with table cloths and a typical bill for 2 is over $100 can you please make an effort?! Or how's this, please don't wear shorts and T-shirts. Or worn out jeans. At least the hostess made the guy take off his baseball cap. On that note, this \"no hats\" rule seems at odds with the fact that they let the table of 4 slobs in anyway. A brightly lit restaurant filled with tables of bachelorette parties (I saw no less than 4 tables of ladies on the prowl) wearing silly wigs and hats do not for a romantic dinner out make. If they are going to ask that gentlemen remove hats (and I get that, even if the hat is a really nice one), it seems they should stay consistent with a more refined vibe. No?\n\nNow that *that* is out of the way...\n\nI started with the wood-grilled Eggplant Reloude. *Incroyable!!!!! So good that I needed to exclaim in French. The eggplant is perfectly grilled and is sweet/smoky with delicioso (see? I did it again) ricotta/marscapone inside and topped with a bit of tomato sauce. Perfetto. (stop, Joi, just stop).\n\nAs I mentioned in my previous review, Muriel's main nod to vegetarians is with a seasonal \"Vegetarian Soiree\" entree. I appreciate the seasonality but last year's vegetable plate was much much better than this year's - I visited during the same season, winter. This time there was a so-so mushroom crepe rather than polenta. There was no kale. There was inedible eggplant that was tough/bitter/chewy. Pickled cucumbers. Pedestrian spaghetti squash. In fact, it was altogether unmemorable to the point that I had to just look at the menu to remember what was on it so I could write this review. Not bad, just nowhere nearly as impressive as last year. Give us vegetarians at least one other exciting option, perhaps? A vegetarian tasting menu? Dare to dream...\n\nOn the other hand, that butterscotch pudding dessert was birthday bliss-worthy.\n\nSo, there you have it. Five star lunch combined with a 2.5 star dinner (five star service and decor) means just hanging in there at 4 stars. I'm still a fan of this legendary and beautiful French Quarter restaurant.

They are uber important!\n\nI was referred to Dr. Loyola by my regular dentist at Mid-City Smiles. I'll be honest and say I had misgivings when I walked into what could only be called a dreary waiting room (it's tiny, without windows). I was called into yet another dark, slightly sinister room (I was scared like a baby and I have a terrific imagination. C'mon, laugh with me here) and then realized it had to be this way because, X-rays. But come on, at least make the waiting room inviting?\n\nOK, so I realize how ridiculous this all sounds. The *good* news? Getting my tooth pulled here was 10X more seamless than it was when I got my last one pulled elsewhere three years ago (I'll spare you the horror story). Dr. Loyola had me in and out in about 30 minutes. Can you believe that? I was terrified about going under with anesthesia as last time, I just received novocaine. And that, was horrible, so it didn't take much convincing. My last dentist couldn't get my bottom tooth out (after 20 minutes of yanking. I guess I can't totally spare you from that horror story), and so recommended that I go to a surgeon. Dr. Loyola told me that it's pretty common for the bottom teeth to be more difficult. He was also honest and said that I should just spare myself enduring the procedure while conscious. \n\nOne other thing: he was also honest that the source of my pain could be due to something else (namely, clenching and grinding my teeth) and said that I didn't necessarily have to get the tooth out. I appreciate being conservative rather than \"just get it yanked, you don't need it\" philosophy that's all the rage these days, but I knew it had to go and I was right. \n\nGetting put under was not quite fun (I have these veins that are difficult to tap into) but what I did like was that it was almost twilight-y (not of the glitter and teenaged vampire variety) and I wasn't entirely unconscious. I didn't feel any pain, though I guess I was moving a lot b/c I recall being reprimanded a bit by the doctor. He's more stern than jokey, but whatever. The tooth. Is. Gone.\n\nThe reason for three stars? Their billing policy is utterly absurd and unheard of (to me, at least). Get this: even though my insurance covers anesthesia, I had to lay out the 300+ dollars *just in case they didn't.* What kind of BS is that? Oh and the clincher? The ridiculous % surcharge for using your CC. Because surely it makes sense to carry almost 400 dollars in cash around with you for dental services. It's unacceptable and I won't return here for that reason alone (it cost me well over 30 dollars for the \"convenience\"). I realize you've been burned by patients before but that doesn't exactly instill confidence in your professionalism. I've been to two other dentists in NOLA and they always bill you later if your insurance doesn't cover a procedure.\n\nSo, that's that. I'd give only two stars for the ridiculous payment policy but I was rather impressed by my practically pain and discomfort-free extraction (and that's probably what you really need to care about). Plus the ladies who assist and work the reception are really nice. And yes, I did receive a check from them right away after they were paid by my insurance. This was a month after the procedure was done and I can survive without that 350 dollars in my account but not everyone is that lucky. \n\nOh and another positive note: the room where you get your surgery done is practically cheery, with big windows!", "date": "2015-02-04 22:07:34"}, {"_key": "834213", "_id": "reviews/834213", "_rev": "_fNysY0O--S", "review_id": "IGVQGSx4j7_tBtxbUjfWhA", "user_id": "0G-QF457q_0Z_jKqh6xWiA", "business_id": "4WdDY97x4GdMYtyk1KQMnw", "stars": 5, "useful": 18, "funny": 12, "cool": 13, "text": "I've met the banh m\u00ed that I want to marry and live happily ever after with!\n\nI shamefully admit that for a while now, I've been kinda meh about banh m\u00ed in general.

I'm not too crazy about how bright it is in there and definitely not a fan of the huge TVs, but that didn't detract from all the other greatness going on... like the food and the cocktail I soon had in my hands (I can ignore TVs, but it's funny how the child next to me was transfixed on the Simpsons as soon as he sat down. We need less TVs in restaurants, world!). \n\nGetting back to the cocktail: Mint Iced Tea. GET. IT. On this warm Sunday in February (75 degrees in the evening!), I couldn't resist a taste of summer and even though I typically detest sweetened tea, this drink is on point! I can easily see myself throwing back three of these on a porch somewhere. It goes just as well with the avocado spring rolls I ordered, however. These spring rolls are now my favorite in town, because they are just bursting with fresh ingredients, like mint, avo, carrots, sprouts and vermicelli. Dip these babies into that perfect peanut sauce that comes with. So so so good! \n\nVeg heads get happy for there are options a-plenty. I can't refuse a bowl of bun, and there is a lemongrass tofu option that is brimming over with tofu and vermicelli noodles. Lilly's has an option to add veggies to that, so next time I'll ask if that's possible here because it could only make this better! The lemongrass tofu is spectacularly tasty, with a texture that is crunchy on the outside and slightly firm on the in. Herbs and hot sauce only serve to heighten the fresh flavor that's going on up in here!

It didn't detract from the extremely delicious Thai iced tea, however and I'm definitely a fan.\n\nAlthough Honeydeux is more of a take-out kind of place, they also have a decent seating area, with a comfortable loungey area up front that's nice to work at, especially if, say, the closest coffeeshops are packed with people.", "date": "2014-01-27 20:30:16"}, {"_key": "863701", "_id": "reviews/863701", "_rev": "_fNysZrK---", "review_id": "KGyq1SKitQGg2uaKM6ORPg", "user_id": "0G-QF457q_0Z_jKqh6xWiA", "business_id": "Zi-F-YvyVOK0k5QD7lrLOg", "stars": 5, "useful": 18, "funny": 6, "cool": 14, "text": "For my 1100th review, I review the iconic Muriel's Jackson Square, one of the loveliest restaurant/event spaces in New Orleans. I first attended a wedding here on Halloween 2010. My two fabulous friends pulled out all the stops and had an amazing horror movie-themed wedding where Jason and Leatherface got things started with a bang (er, a chainsaw). Sure seems like the folks behind Muriels worked well with my friends and the wedding was an occasion to remember. We were upstairs, where private events are held, and took breaks from the main room in the bordello-like seance room. One of my favorite things about this night included hanging out with cocktails on huge balcony overlooking Jackson Square. \n\nBy the way, if you're dining here and there isn't an event going on, you're free to go upstairs and check all that out. You can even have a drink and bring it up to the Seance Room (and I strongly recommend that you do, if you like rooms dripping in red, chandeliers, velvet and brocade. It makes me want to decorate my entire apartment in a similar fashion). \n\nRecently I came to realize that besides the gorgeous environs, the restaurant serves up some really great food and drink. My friends and I had lunch here recently. We were seated in the room where they open the huge glass doors to the sidewalk so you can watch passersby and listen to music being played out in Jackson Square. \n\nAt lunchtime, they offer $4 Bloody Marys, wines and martinis. I indulged in a Bloody Mary, as I am often wont to do, and found it to be quite satisfactory (garnished with olives, pickled green beans and citrus and served in a pint glass. No skimping here just cuz it's a mere 4 bucks). \n\nI ordered the modestly-named Vegetable Plate. I'll be honest and say I wasn't expecting much because I've had many a pedestrian veg plate where they barely even marinate the vegetables before skewering them and grilling. Booooring. \n\nI'm thrilled to report that Muriel's Vegetable Plate belongs in the Vegetable Plate Hall of Fame. First of all, it contains braised kale. Almost 'nuff said there, but I'll go on to say its flavor is just so so so very good. The other star of the plate is that compact square of polenta flavored with herbs and Parm cheese. Everything is so delicately placed, which I love, and nothing overwhelmed with oils or heavy sauces to \"make up for\" the fact that you're eating a plate of vegetables. There's a delightful little bit of everything from beets to parsnips to tender shittake mushrooms. A healthy, hearty plate. Thank you, Muriels! I seriously could not stop thinking about it all day.\n\nThey also have a gluten-free menu.\n\nI think I'll be dining here on the regular when I have visitors in town. It's just the perfect place to take them when they want the quintessential French Quarter dining experience.", "date": "2013-02-08 17:33:47"}, {"_key": "885525", "_id": "reviews/885525", "_rev": "_fNysaTK--X", "review_id": "2vcF_alecAF5KvkMykc_9A", "user_id": "0G-QF457q_0Z_jKqh6xWiA", "business_id": "1ddqdY_piKp-abaZ-bGRSA", "stars": 5, "useful": 24, "funny": 15, "cool": 23, "text": "Yes, you're reading this correctly: I, Joi B, mostly raw vegan chick, not only went willingly to a steak house, but I'm giving this steak house 5 glorious stars, yo!\n\nIt's old school as you can get.

While that didn't actually happen, what I did order made me extremely happy, not to mention the attentive and friendly service, and the environment within this boisterous old jernt. \n\nMy friends and I got in on one of those fabulous curtained booths. I love private booths, what can I say? So, they had me there. I was dubious about what I'd be served here, I can't lie. And I was ragingly hungry after having worked up quite the appetite at the ostrich and zebra races earlier (yes, yes, I realize I was not a very good vegetarian on Saturday. I might as well have worn leather shoes while I was at it. Oh wait...)\n\nA perusal of the menu had me ordering sides of spinach, mushrooms and German potatoes.

It was impossible to resist because seriously, this garlic bread is perfection, pure comfort food and like I said, I was starvin' marvin.\n\nAnd I had a glass of wine, a decent pinot noir (they have a very respectable list of wines by the bottle and glass). \n\nAnd then I gorged on the side orders I mention above. Whereas I expected reheated dishes of frozen monstrosities, I received: *fresh* baby spinach leaves, *fresh* whole mushrooms  and freshly sliced/flash fried potato rounds. Granted the spinach had been sauteed in butter, but not overly so, and the mushrooms were served in a butter broth (oh come on, like who the hell could resist that?), but it wasn't overpowering.

I've found a hotel that *has it all*. I felt so privileged to be staying at this top-notch property and that's pretty remarkable, seeing as I typically have found some fault with just about any hotel I've stayed in.\n\nWhen thinking of how to describe the style of hotel, the words \"casual luxury\" comes to mind. It doesn't have the glitz & glamah of the Four Seasons, nor is it tragically hip like the W Hotels (read: no glowing Buddhas in the room). \n\nThink: sophisticated, yet approachable. No bells & whistles. No parading ducks. No fountains, nor waterfalls. No Buddhas glowing in your hotel room. No dance music in the lobby and no suits on the make in the hotel bar. It actually makes me think of how hotels might have been in the 1960s (though it does not have a consciously retro vibe or look). Classy!!!\n\nThere's a complimentary wine hour. There's art that's not trying too hard. There's comfy couches and shiny wood floors (slight criticism that they need to avoid the orange oil as I almost took a spill a few times).\n\nNot for a minute do they skimp on the amenities you'd expect (bathrobes, killer bath products, amazing rain showers, sumptuous beds), and then some (turn down service with ice, chocolates and bottles of water) \n\nEspresso machines in the hallway are a nice touch seeing as I don't like drip coffee (there are drip machines in the room, if you so desire). I hit these up periodically throughout the day. The gym is a step above any hotel gym that I've used before, with complimentary bottles of water, headphones, green apples and towels for your convenience. I used it three times during my five days, which made it AOK for me to indulge in those damn fancy peanut butter cups and chocolate turtles the housekeeper left on my pillow every night. \n\nThe staff, from front desk to concierge to valet is superb (and I might add, quite easy on the eyes. Hells yes, you can help me with my suitcase, kind sir!) I swear, I did not purposely leave my purse in the cab so that I could rely on the help of the valet to retrieve it for me... *bats eyes*... but I can't say I regretted it either.\n\nHutton Hotel, I can't imagine how you could be better.

Never had that happen to me in a WF before, just staying.\n\nHere, there's sushi/noodle bar, pizza, bread, display cases of deli prepped stuff (plenty of veg options), a sandwich bar with plenty of tempting options, as well as build-your-own. Yeah, I can get behind all of this. \n\nThere's also a g-damn COOKIE BAR. Is that really necessary, I wonder? Too funny. Thanks for putting that in my head, Whole Foods. Whatever. I can't quit you. \n\nTheir bulk section is also far superior to Uptown's. They have chia seeds! If you buy them by the bag, they are a small fortune, so you do save a considerable amount buying in bulk (tip: use the peanut butter containers for these, as a tiny hole in your bag of seeds will ruin your day). \n\nThen there's the massive produce area that's so well spread out, thanks to the much larger space. While this location lacks the charm of old Arabella Station (of course), what I need in a supermarket is not necessarily charm (imagine that coming from me).

Truthfully, though, once I moved here, I have not been back since yesterday. And I also had only drank here, back in the days before they even had veggie burgers. \n\nSo, it had been a long day of drinking and no eating. A parade day... By 6, or was it 7 or 8pm, I was really feeling it. I hate being hungry in the French Quarter because I don't have tons of options here (that aren't dress-up places, that is). I remembered Yo Mama's famed burger list and immediately was craving some crazy veggie burger piled high with whatever other crazy concoction they could come up with and insisted we make an immediate beeline (er, crooked, inebriated beeline).

I am always in the mood for seafood so after doing a Yelp search, we headed to the end of the pier to SB Shellfish Co.  \n\nFirst of all, it was Memorial day weekend, so the pier was packed with people & they all seemed to be waiting for a table at this place or waiting for their order at the to go window.  Good sign but bad thing since we were hungry.  We put our name on the list (there were at least 10 parties in front of us), then noticed the side to go window so ordered from there.\n\nWe had...\n*Steamed mussels in wine garlic reduction sauce....the mussels were fresh, plump & tasty in the sauce...the BF was even slurping the sauce from the shells!  You also get two bowls full of mussels (1 lb.) for $13.\n*Crab sandwich - this was on the small side, but the crab inside was tasty.  Came with a side of cole slaw & huge onion rings (I liked these).\n*Clam chowder...chunky & creamy, but not too thick...this was really good!\n\nThey do have several picnic tables outside with umbrellas & finding a seat was no problem.  Do recommend ordering from the to go window to skip the wait...only problem is that alcohol can't be served through the to go window.  Although I left my little four legged one at home, this place was very puppy friendly if you sit outside.  The inside of the restaurant is actually really tiny with only 4 tables...the rest being bar seating.  I think the outside worked out better for us since we enjoyed the view.  Also entertaining to see an Asian family that each ordered a whole steamed rock crab (there was like 10 of them) cheering each time their number was called so they can pick it up. :-D", "date": "2010-06-03 16:26:33"}, {"_key": "1095725", "_id": "reviews/1095725", "_rev": "_fNyr1kq--O", "review_id": "hUw-vo67NJ1IRApujvu6Ww", "user_id": "2aYKApNwS5gi1XS_V6qYJg", "business_id": "_9anWibEkGD0fdIDruqZAA", "stars": 5, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This was a very pleasant experience.

I have eaten here several times and have never been disappointed, in fact, I have been amazed at the quality and taste of the food each time.  The mole is sublime.   The carne asada perfect.   The place is family run, and ihey definitely saved money by not putting it into the decor which is a bit worn and and sun faded walls with old Naugahyde upholstered booths, but the food is what your looking for anyway right?  If more people knew about this place, I am sure it would have a  following such as El Sol, which is the closest restaurant I can compare it to in terms of how the food tastes.  But this place is far less pretentious or  expensive.  If you can get over the divey look of the place, and the location, and just appreciate the quality of the food, you'll will have found a great alternative to the clone like Mexican restaurants where you over eat and can't even remember how it tasted afterward.  In fact, this is likely where all the people that work at those restaurants go for breakfast, lunch or dinner out at a place like this.  I should mention that although the restaurant is a bit threadbare--I have observed a a very clean kitchen, with the cook wearing a spotless apron, so we know we have a cook who is serious about food and her kitchen.  All great finds like this one have their quirks and this one's quirk is it is easy to miss.  Although it is right on Michigan just west of the intersection with Rural on the near east side, and across from an old Hardware store, it kind of just blends in.   Do yourself a favor and take a chance like I did--you'll be back again and again.    Best of all it doesn't seem to do much advertising so it is never crowded, and often you can have the whole place to yourself--perfect for that long date where you just want to sit and talk with someone, but go with your boho adventurous spirit, and appreciate the place for what it is.  Oh, one more quirk--it is cash only, but that is exactly what you would expect.  :).", "date": "2010-05-26 23:50:30"}, {"_key": "1171176", "_id": "reviews/1171176", "_rev": "_fNyr4ZG--T", "review_id": "8e7APCGM4WFYuxybPoVYgw", "user_id": "sHwBXS0trP0CC_f5K_11VA", "business_id": "AhVvuzwWQU__CligbY4r0Q", "stars": 5, "useful": 4, "funny": 3, "cool": 4, "text": "My parents brought me a kids bean and cheese burrito from this restaurant one afternoon when I wasn't feeling well.

Of the four, the Sweet Maegan Ann is my favorite, with its sweet molassesy goodness mixing in very well with pulled pork (which does need something else). My wife is a very saucy lass, and she threw the Voodoo and the Vinegar in there as well. \n\nAs always, sides are an afterthought to meat, and Bogart's could honestly serve slaps to my face along with those ribs and I'd still come back for more.

I need to add my review to Yelp but even for old fashioned home cooking it was bland. I have decided that if a restaurant is at least half full of customers by 5pm and they are primarily over the age of say 75, turn and run. Lunch it's hard to judge by time but still can judge by age. I have found it to be true enough times that it is one of Melissa's Rules (like Gibbs' on NCIS). It was Friday and the special was catfish. We asked what was special about the Friday night catfish special vs the catfish on the menu - it had hushpuppies for the same price. REALLY, you added a couple of hushpuppies and that made it the Friday night special? Jeff had that and it was okay. I love fried pork chops so I chose that based on the recommendation of our rather young waiter. What makes a pork chop irresistible is that layer of fat around the edges and the sweetness of the meat clinging to the bone. My favorite places for pork chops know me and know that the uglier the chop, the better and select them especially like that for me. What was I served at Nana's? A couple of flavorless, overly thick slabs of pork loin sans fat, sans bone, with the breading heavy and not clinging to the meat. I ordered some greens and mashed potatoes and gravy as my sides if I remember correctly but I tried Jeff's sides and I know we had some sort of beans also. The greens were so bland that no amount of pepper vinegar and salt could season them. If things are not seasoned properly from the start, there is almost nothing you can do to save them and these were obviously one of those. The mashed potatoes were not even room temperature and the gravy was not hot enough to help warm them. As we were getting ready to leave, we heard others complaining about their steak special. I normally try to give a place a second try but each time we pass by my stomach begs me not to stop. Oh and while Nana herself might be there, I didn't find this place feeling particularly homey or welcoming and the service was at best average. There you go - my no holes barred review. I'll stick to Bolton's Spicy Chicken & Fish, Danguire's, or Skillet's for my pork chops and meat and three.", "date": "2013-09-07 18:34:46"}, {"_key": "1158410", "_id": "reviews/1158410", "_rev": "_fNyr39q--P", "review_id": "GrA8k76z0h7npbBWi73BJg", "user_id": "8zkkuk8KOoNojZhTx0j5KA", "business_id": "kRh2647DS9MNnqQs89Ttgg", "stars": 4, "useful": 4, "funny": 2, "cool": 2, "text": "I forget to check in every time we go but we come here almost every Friday night now.

My husband almost always has the East chilaquiles with chicken which most places don't even have on their menu. I have tried a lot of things and never been disappointed. They have recently changed the menu up slightly so I am trying to figure out where a couple of my dishes went or what they are called now. I started to list everything but realized I have probably had between 1/3 and 1/2 of the things on their menu. So just a few favorites:\nQueso fundido (cheese dip with chorizo and flour tortillas) - sometimes I will have this for my meal.\nCameron Ranchero (shrimp in ranchero sauce with grilled onions, peppers, and tomatoes) - this is SO good! The ranchero sauce adds a touch of heat but not too much.\nSteak Alambres (sort of like fajitas but with bacon and then cheese melted on top) - these are SO good but how could it not be with bacon and melted cheese?\nMilanese (very thin cutlets of chicken or beef that are breaded and fried) - Lately these have been my go to. It's two fairly large but thin pieces of meat, I've had both and they are both good.\nAuthentic Mexican Tacos (three soft tacos filled with your choice of carnitas, chicken, carne asada or chorizo) - It's hard to choose but the carnitas are good and again I asked for them to be shredded a little more and fried a little crispier. The char beans are whole beans cooked with chorizo and so good. If you like hot stuff, make sure to have them bring you the special hot sauce that goes with these tacos - warning it is HOT. I always ask to hold the raw onions on the tacos but make sure they bring me grilled young onions that go with them (not the little green onions/scallions but just small onions with the greens still attached).", "date": "2016-11-06 01:09:27"}, {"_key": "1190499", "_id": "reviews/1190499", "_rev": "_fNyr5Cm--Z", "review_id": "chhglHQIfxKfQeh-U5UBkA", "user_id": "8zkkuk8KOoNojZhTx0j5KA", "business_id": "BvqJe6XmjKC8fQsjEMsCrg", "stars": 3, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I had gotten food to go from here a long time ago and I didn't remember it being anything special but everyone kept raving about it and several friends that know their food said that this was their favorite Mexican place.

First the atmosphere - I did like the clean, open and modern feel. I did not use the restrooms but I noticed a long vanity with two sinks along one wall in the dining area that was very unusual and a little uncomfortable feeling and must admit I don't like it.\n\nI tried several dishes to get a feel and satisfy my cravings that night. I started out with the fried calamari. In an Asian restaurant I pretty much expect this to be a tempura batter or at least panko. These looked like the typical pre-breaded frozen calamari rings you can buy in the grocery and they pretty much tasted as much. Not particularly fresh and just a hit of toughness that comes from not being fresh or slightly overcooked.\n\nNext was the shrimp tempura. This was just ok. The only thing that kept it from being good to great was was such a small thing but the whole difference. The tempura batter was not cooked enough or the oil temp was not hot enough when they were dropped.It was soft, but not soggy, instead of crispy.\n\nMy biggest disappointment came in the Korean fried chicken wings. I wanted to try both sauces but on the side for several reasons. I wanted to taste them plain. I knew something would be going home with me and probably some of these and the calamari rather than the tempura so if they weren't sauced, they would reheat and crisp up better. And because I wasn't sure of which sauce I would prefer. I was told that they cannot send them out plain because they can't finish the dish that way. Well finish the dish out must have meant sprinkle the sesame seed on top of the sticky sauce coated wings and have it stick. I was not crazy about either sauce and particularly disappointed that they both had a good bit of sugar in them as I am diabetic and it's just something not needed to make the sauces good. And since I did take most of them home, they were soggy and did not crisp back up with reheating. I also asked them if their crust was gluten free and the waitress could not answer me nor the hostess but she said they could make it gluten free. That sort of made me uncomfortable with bringing my friend that truly has celiac here. We had another place that made all of their kfc and sauces gluten free.\n\nOverall it was an okay experience but not good enough that I really want to go back.

We also got an order of the spicy shredded beef with peppers.  This was good, but there were only a few shreds of peppers.

Siam Salmon: Great tangy sauce with a delicious fillet accompanied by crispy, fried crab.  Love!\n6. Salt and Pepper Shrimp Rolls: Filled with actual whole jumbo shrimp and served with a delicious dip.  This is unique to Jasmine Rice so highly recommend trying.\n7. Papaya Salad: Good but not differentiated from the other versions.\n8. Chicken Lettuce Wraps: A great spicy version of a classic.  It's a Gar pao accompanied with large Romaine leaves.  I would recommend getting a bowl of sticky rice and having the chicken with the rice.\n\nService is very attentive but the seating is pretty cramped so definitely book reservations for a party of more than 2.

We were here for UC Dining Days and the dishes were great.  I had the chicken satay app with the red curry chicken, and found both to be very good.  The satay was juicy and flavorful with a great peanut dipping sauce, and the curry was very solid although it wasn't very spicy.  I also had a few bites of the triple flavor tilapia in the sweet and sour sauce, and really like the crispy, pan-seared fillet combined with the garlicky sauce.  Will definitely have to get this next time.  Most restaurants like to fry the fillet when they make a sweet and sour dish but pan searing actually brings out the flavor more and gives that delicious crispy exterior without killing your arteries.  We finished off with the mango sticky rice and coconut rice pudding.  While the mango sticky rice was very good, I liked the coconut rice pudding more because I love all things coconut and this was a delicious coconut-based concoction.  If you are in the area this week, and need to grab a bite, definitely stop in for the $15 dining days special.  It's a great deal and the food is very good.  They also have homemade beef jerky at $6/order, which I couldn't resist getting to-go; while it wasn't as fantastic as my aunt's homemade jerky, the meat was very well-marinated and flavorful and great paired with the accompanying chili paste.  The ambiance is very cozy and the unique curry soup bowls add a nice touch.

The bisque was delicious: creamy and savory with a hint of fennel and perhaps truffle (I think?).  Anyhow, whatever the exact flavors were, they meshed well and made for a very good soup.  The croissant was buttery and flaky, although it wasn't amazing; The Little Chef in Princeton still holds the crown for best croissants.  They do bake them on the premises here every day and you can definitely taste the difference, though (not a fan of mass-produced supermarket croissants).  It also comes with a side of pecan butter, which was quite possibly the most delectable spread ever.  It was a nice change from the typical cinnamon butter and just so creamy with a perfect balance of pecan and the butter's inherent flavor.  It almost made me want to get another croissant just so I could finish it.  But then I would have been brought more butter and gluttony would have taken over.  So I desisted...with much restraint on my part.  Dad's BLT with pepper turkey bacon and aadditional semi-spicy fried egg was great and makes me want to add a fried egg to every BLT from now on; it's absolute ingenuity.

Sweet osmanthus and sesame mochi dumpling soup: This was perfectly light, sweet, and refreshing with thin shreds of osmanthus and egg whites.  The dumplings were fluffy and filled with sesame.  They are smaller than normal but each was  perfectly balanced bite of filling to shell.\n2. Crabmeat and pork soup dumplings: These were kind of meh with a thick shell and barely any soup and filling.  Maybe it was an off-day but I would suggest the other pan-fried options instead.\n3. Pan Fried buns: These were better than the soup dumplings but the filling was pretty sparse and definitely could have been more generous in portion.  4. Pan fried dumplings: These were solid with a plump, juicy filling and nicely crispy pan fried shell.\n5. Chive buns: Nice nd crispy with a flavorful egg and chive filling.  The only thing that would have made them better would have been some vemicelli inside but pretty solid overall.\n6. Stir-fried clams: Pretty flavorful clams albeit small ones.  It's a bit on the salty side but still pretty solid.\n7. Plum spare ribs: Fried sweet spareribs with sweet plums.  Overall, a nice appetizer-sized option (the ribs are small).  The meat is flavorful and pretty tender but the dish itself is not very filling so this is more of a starter vs an actual main entree.\n8. Seafood tofu casserole: Mostly light silkn tofu with 3 prawns, some fishballs, and 3 pieces of surimi.  This is very light but the seafood portion was tiny.  The nice part is that it isn't oily at all but it's definitely not your traditional seafood hot pot.\n9. Seafood udon: Stir fried udon with seafood in a traditional brown oyster-soy.  This was pretty standard but it was branded as a Shanghai stir fried thick noodle and it resembled more of a Japanese stir-fried udon.  It was just okay but a bit salty.\n10. Marinated sliced roast beef: This was just okay.  The beef was tender but slightly dry and didn't have that sweet and savaory marinade that is the hallmark of the 5-spice Shanghainese beef.\n11. Seasonal stir-fried vegetables: This was light and refeshing and surprisngly one of the best dishes with sliced lotus, cauliflower, broccoli, snow peas, mushrooms, woodear, carrots, and asparagus.  There was just a very slight coagulation of the corn starch thickener on some pieces but they were very busy tonight and likely understaffed in the kitchen so they were likely making this in a rush.", "date": "2021-05-31 03:45:43"}, {"_key": "819065", "_id": "reviews/819065", "_rev": "_fNysYWm--X", "review_id": "xrotHXt19_3T3yFqbPabzg", "user_id": "ouODopBKF3AqfCkuQEnrDg", "business_id": "bFO_XYnYMDF1GMY9LK3oxQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "The king salmon here is just simply delectable: the meat is moist, flaky, and flavorful.

Nevertheless, it was very flavorful, thin, and decently crispy yet chewy.  One of the best dosas in the area, for sure.  Will definitely come back to try the other varieties, namely the spinach masala.  The chicken korma was just okay; the chicken itself was pretty lean so it wasn't as tender and juicy as I would have preferred and the sauce was creamy and buttery but had too strong of an onion flavor.  While I do like onions a lot, I'm not too sure if I like it to be overpowering in a korma dish, which is supposed to be creamier and coconut-based.  The chapathi was very good for dipping into the extra sauce though and did tone down some of the onion so maybe that's the key.  Prices are very good.

She was very patronizing when I inquired about how big the turkey and chicken entree salads were.  \"It's a salad.  It's lettuce.\"  Well, geez that was super helpful.  Thanks a million for letting me that a salad contains lettuce.  Anyhow, I decided on the grilled chicken tenderloins country dinner plate, which contained 4 TINY pieces of chicken.

The food was pretty standard for the chain, and I did like that I was able to place my order online, pay for it in advance, and park right outside the takeout register and have my food practically delivered to me in minutes, complete with utensils, napkins, and fortune cookies.  Yes, I do realize that my laziness is almost sloth-like but c'est la vie.  I noticed that they have a few new menu items, like the crabmeat fried rice, pad thai, and a duck duo, so I ventured to try the duck, which had a slow cooked leg and a cripsy pan-fried breast served with a watercress salad.  The duck was just okay and the portion was a bit on the small side, but that may be a good thing considering that duck isn't exactly the most cholesterol-friendly poultry meat.  I liked the slow cooked leg more than the breast since the flavor was icily imbued throughout, whereas the breast was a bit bland in the innermost section.  It wasn't bad for a chain but I would definitely get my duck fix at Margaret Kuo, Sangkee, or New East.  The Shanghai shrimp dish was very solid, with tender shrimp, plenty of veggies, and a light yet flavorful garlic sauce.  Definitely better than what you would get from your typical greasy takeout place.  The crab fried rice was pretty good, and it had pieces of bacon, which definitely gave it a bit of a twist.  The actual amount of crabmeat was skimpy but that was to be expected.  The flavor was good, and I was glad to see egg and shitake slices in it; overall, I did like it a lot better than what Dad would usually get from China (insert noun here).  It came to about $37 for all 3, which wasn't bad at all.

Definitely better than the duck that you can get at any other Chinese restaurant in the KoP area (it's a sparse picking since you're left with China King/House/Star), but it's not as amazing as New East's (in the NE), which has that authentic pink-ish flesh in literally every piece.  The crispy fried fish with pine nuts was good with plenty of seeds and a nice batter; the bass meat was tender yet firm and took on the sweetish sauce nicely.  Not as amazing as Margaret Kuo's but still tasty, all the same.  The dan dan noodles were flavorful with plenty of minced pork although the sauce wasn'treally spicy at all.  E Mei's version is definitely spicier and more authentic with a more generous addition of chili oil.

This place is a great place to grab something to eat while having fun in a smoke free environment. Meeting here for drinks and the game is a good choice too, plus their food is better than average bar fare. \n\nThere are not too many restaurants where a group of thirty people can show up unannounced and get seated immediately. There also aren't too many places that said party can get served just as fast as a table of two with food and drink. \n\nI had the fire grilled salmon and it was spicy! A mixture of Louisiana spice rub and a topping of four peppercorn butter. It was delish. The accompanying spinach was just OK - no flavor to it but cooked well - and the rice was bland for a rice pilaf with a spicy meat. The logical follow through would have some type of Cajun gravy for the rice. \n\nThe games we played were very fun and the place was easy to get around, but this was a Thursday and there was no wait at any game. My three year old was the master of some games. She understood the concept and won hundreds of tickets. I guess games just come natural to kids! \n\nThe coupons you win don't go very far in the shop, but there are some cutesy things there. The stuff ranged from candy to stuffed animals to Rock Band 5 and everything in between. The tickets that she won amounted to a pink stuffed monkey. \n\nMy only gripe is their policy on gaming cards. It would be so much easier for them to just take the amount of tickets it takes to purchase an item, but instead they make you put the amount of tickets you won on your gaming card, even though the tickets are a physical piece of paper. And you can only have one gaming card per person. So if you lose your card, you are SOL and have to go ALL the way to the front of the place, stand in line, explain that you misplaced your card, wait for your server to get you your original receipt so they can get a number, and then wait for a manager to finally come up and approve a replacement card. Dumb. Why the hell can't they have zero balance cards for people to replace their lost card. It's not like I was worried about someone else playing my games. And, furthermore, if they had just had the tickets done electronically instead of wasting paper and killing trees, you bet I would have paid better attention to my card since it actually does have a value! It seems like that plan wasn't thought completely through, master?** \n\nAnyway, if you don't want to redeem your worthless tickets, then this place is bonkers.

I used to be a big fan and recommend their (previously) outstanding full service outside AND inside wash.  It made my car look brand new with even just a basic wash and wax.  However, their works inside service has been quite sub par lately, even as the price has crept up three bucks in the last few years from $16 in 2003 to $21 today.\n\nI waited for probably a few minutes more than I needed because I did not realize from across the lot if the car was \"done\" or not.  The driver door was just left open with the keys in the ignition.  Was I supposed to guess?  Did anyone care to come and ask me if I would like to inspect their work?  Did anyone care to close my car door and not risk it being hit by other vehicles, or worse, risk someone trying to steal it?  I did not understand why there was no communication between employees and customers, except when they ask what I want to purchase, and when I pay inside.\n\nAt my last visit, I could not tell how much \"work\" had been done.  The tire shine had been applied, but they didn't look clean, or shined.  They just looked wet.  The rear view mirror still had the annoying smudge on it, which is the main reason I went out of my way to this location.  The cup holder area was also not wiped down.\n\nI did address the cleanliness issues with the supervisor there on duty when I finally figured out that the workers were not coming back to my car.   He went and took care of the rear view mirror and the cup holders, but did not come to tell me that he was finished until I asked him.   Where is the personal responsibility here?  And why did he do it himself, when he should be directing his hourly employees to finish their work?\n\nFinally, now that I've driven after dark for the first time this year, I noticed that the inside window \"cleaning\" job was done with dirty rags that left lint and greasy smudges everywhere.  There were noticeable parts of the windows, especially the passenger side that were not wiped.\n\nEven though I cannot get a full service wash at Mike's, the service there is light years ahead of Sparkling Image.

The lobby connects everything together and makes a nice respite from the agony of waiting through six hour surgeries on your love one.  The lobby contains a pharmacy (WellSpring) a Starbucks (or as Ethan would call it, \"Evil Starbux\"), two different gift shops, an ATM, service desk, the aforementioned player piano, free wi-fi, natural lighting (see sunlight), and dozens of chairs and places to relax.\n\nThe care here is also top notch, not only for the patient, but for the family as well.  There are personalized \"guest relations\" employees whose whole purpose is to keep the family members updated, keep track where they are going, page them when they have an update, and bring them back to see their loved ones.  Now that's five star service!\n\nYou do not take my word for it, (but you could if you wanted, since I am Yelp Elite 2011), but... You can also eat like a rock star too!  No seriously, I am not kidding!!  The food here is fabulous!!!  Yes, I know it's a hospital, but the food is fantastic and is prepared with health, allergies, etc. in mind!  There is a chef who will make personal omelet for you.  Yes, I just said, \"chef.\"  There are also healthy (and not so healthy, but tasty) dishes available and that's just during breakfast!  For lunch, this place has (deep breath), a deli, a pizza parlor, a grill, an Asian station, a gourmet entree station, warm dessert area, soup station, salad station, and healthy drinks and snacks, and cold desserts.

Yes, I have actually come here to eat when I didn't have anything medical related on the agenda!  Todd's World! Party time!! Excellent!!!\n\nFinally, the medical care here is top notch.  It is focused on the patient and their overall health, preventing further issues, and family support over the long term, and not just what's going on now.  Support of family and follow up is very important here, and Community has an expansive network of services, including home care, relations with several long term facilities, and some of the best rehabilitation facilities in the nation (Hook Rehabilitation.)  Also, their extensive network of MedCheck facilities ensure that you are not far from one of their network related doctor's facilities. MedCheck offers services not only to scheduled patients, but also to walk-ins without an appointment, so one may avoid going to the ER for something that is urgent, but not life threatening.

Did these people eat at the same place i did? Who are giving this place such high ratings? Maybe in the area, there are not to many places like this, so Bailey's stands out. But i was visiting town, and I am used to great burger joints so this was a severe let down. \n\nTo be fair, I might have gone during an off time (it was a weekday, around 3 pm), but it was still no excuse for bad food. Good establishments should be consistent, no? If they can't be, then they should consider closing between lunch and dinner service.\n\nFirst off, i love the decor and layout. I am a sucker for long rustic community tables. The waitress took a while to come, and also in between (we had to flag other waitstaff to help us), but she was very sweet. These are the reasons the review is not 1-starred. But unfortunately, things went downhill from here. The boy went with the American burger (he wanted to go with a safe choice, not knowing how the food would be). I got the duck burger based on the waitress' recommendation. I asked between 3 burgers and she reassured me the duck was her fave in the whole menu. Sold! We also ordered loaded fries and smoked onion rings. \n\nThe sides came. Fries were cold (as if they were leftover from earlier) and dry, saved slightly by the \"loads\" on them. But there was a funny taste to the topping i couldn't pinpoint. We ended up scrapping the topping off, and eating the fries with the shiracha catsup that came with it. I am a ketchup purist and i don't get why people want to mess with the good old heinz. If they'd just mixed the sriracha with the ketchup, it might have been better. But the regular catsup base wasnt too good to begin with. The redeeming item was the rooster sauce, which i dumped everything into, fries, and the plain lukewarm boring onion rings. The onion rings' batter were way too thick, and it wasn't close to being hot, so now you have donut like onion rings. The smoke flavor was nowhere to be smelled or tasted. \n\nThe burgers came. I took a bite of mine and felt so let down. I am a duck lover, and i eat a lot of it (being Asian and all, too). This duck was not prepared correctly  so what you get is tough patty and flavors that didn't quite come together. It was missing a lot of things. At this time, i looked across and felt jealous that boy got the safe burger. How can you go wrong with the American? Well, it turned out to be worse than the duck. This burger too was not hot, and was on the cold side. The patty was dry and well done (asked for medium), the mac & cheese topping it was meant to give it flavor and cheesiness. Instead it was a clump of off tasting mac & cheese. It was mostly mac, and flour (roux) sans the cheese. The ratio was off. it seemed that whoever made it didnt make the roux correctly so the flour was still on the forefront. It failed as a bechamel or a standalone mac n cheese. Neither of us finished the burgers. \n\nSo what i gathered is that Bailey's has good concepts, but very poor execution. Either the cook on hand was misguided by how he was to prep the food and have them out, in which case we were unlucky SOBs. Or most patrons don't even realize the poor execution (like duck is not to be overcooked, otherwise it gets tough!), to know any better. I think it could be more the former. I hope they do much better during regular food service hours. For us, the first experience was so bad, we can never bring ourselves to try it again.

Also, we were pretty set on just sharing one order of fajitas as we had no way of easily transporting leftovers (we were in the middle of a long walk).  At any rate, the server tried to talk us into a second order of fajitas.  He told us it was a pretty small serving.  We resisted getting a second order, figuring we could just order something else if it didn't fill us up.  Okay, so all of that and the one order of fajitas was massive.  We didn't come close to finishing.  Another annoyance, is for the massive sizzling skillet of goodness, we were given three tiny tortillas.  No way you could have fit the meat and veg in three tortillas.  Of course additional cost, but it was necessary.  Another annoyance was the teensy ramekins holding the dips for the sampler.  A little weak for the price tag.  \n\nSo a few negatives, but the place is new and this certainly won't steer me away.", "date": "2011-04-04 01:58:26"}, {"_key": "1106388", "_id": "reviews/1106388", "_rev": "_fNyr18S--c", "review_id": "z63P9fKgnCwlhJne4yUUeQ", "user_id": "gYDFiPYFCeY52vvMvvy5Pw", "business_id": "3_WGRjRrnZX2b4ZVpjmL6w", "stars": 3, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Maybe my expectations were too high, but I was pretty disappointed with my first Arnold's experience.  \n\nWhen I walked in I noticed a huge sign for takeout orders and assumed that is where you go to place a takeout order.

People went on to day that it was one of their favorite restaurants.\n\nThe d\u00e9cor was nice... didn't look overly high end, but it was nice for a store in the mall.\n\nThe menu is small... a few salads, sandwiches, entress and kids meals.\n\nMy wife got a roasted vegetable paninni and I got a pizza with prosciutto, herbs and different cheeses. After a few bites my wife said, \"wow... I really like this sandwich. I REALLY like it\". I enjoyed my pizza too... reminded me of a fantastic place in San Francisco that we were at a few years ago.\n\nThe ingredients tasted fresh and the food tasted good. What more could you want?!??!

Yes... very much so.\n\nMy wife and I both agreed that our server, Chelsea, was pretty awesome. She saw that we had a baby with us... not only did she say how cute our son was(always a plus), but she also said that she would take our order instead of us having to go to the food counter to order the food. It wasn't the biggest deal in the world, but she took the extra time to make sure that a couple with a small baby were taken care of... She checked up on us multiple times, brought over our check at the right time and made sure our sodas were always full... and she did all of these things with a smile.\n\nMy wife and I have gone to fine dining restaurants in Philly and NYC where we spent 4 or 5 times as much on food that wasn't as good and have gotten less than stellar service.

There were literally two other tables with people in them at that time. I'll let that one go though... maybe this is some sort of acceptable business practice for restaurants.\n\nBut the problems really started with our waitress... not only did we wait almost 10 minutes for her to say hello to us.

I guess she was hoping for a better tip. (sigh)\n\nWhat made it worse was that she was so warm and inviting to the other tables that were seated after us. My wife and I sat there in shock.

They do have some unique and interesting flavors, and from the looks of the other pictures on Yelp, it appears they rotate their flavors pretty often too.  The donuts were light and fluffy, and did I mention they are huge?  Out of the three that we ordered, the Coconut Mango was my favorite.  The cream filling wasn't too sweet, which is perfect for me.  \n\nI do love the space.  Exposed brick walls, kinda industrial looking.  Seating is pretty limited, but since most people are just eating a donut or burgers, the turnover was pretty quick.      \n\nOverall, I think this was a great find!", "date": "2018-05-30 22:07:18"}, {"_key": "285857", "_id": "reviews/285857", "_rev": "_fNyr9Ai--c", "review_id": "_zD3UTzvCdjy3yqRlNCmuw", "user_id": "NRrNQ5xHn_7Fu4ctlpKLbQ", "business_id": "BxveuvYElRjEIuVNiJAEtA", "stars": 4, "useful": 2, "funny": 2, "cool": 1, "text": "Bone Daddy and Chicago were excellent and some of the best ribs I've ever had the pleasure of eating. Anywhere you go will be excellent but some are out of this world amazing. \n\nThe people got it right as Chicago BBQ Company won for the Peoples Choice. I personally loved Kinders and its hard to pick one over the other. \n\nThe party starts officially at 11AM but we came on Saturday morning at around 9:45 and there were a dozen places that were already selling. My suggestion is to be on the street and ready to eat before 10AM so you can avoid the HEAT and the crowds. Then by 11 you can go back to your room for a few minutes. \n\nThere is a 97% chance we will be back next year.", "date": "2013-09-05 16:20:25"}]
