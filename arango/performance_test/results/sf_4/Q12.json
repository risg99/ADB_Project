To be honest, it had been at least 8 years since my last visit to UB's and when I walked in for my recent breakfast it was as if things had never changed. That was because they hadn't.\n\nWe were quickly seated, which surprised me since it was a Sunday and around 9:00AM. I guess everyone was either at church or sleeping in. The restaurant was still very full and the tables are cramped very close together. Keeping the closeness in mind, you may want to keep that in mind when picking your subject of conversation.

She also had a good sense of humor, she chuckled when I asked if there were any off the menu specials. Since they had no specials we went with the Country Fried Steak and the 2 Pork Chop Breakfast. Both came with two eggs and hash browns on the side. In addition to these hearty breakfasts, we shared an order of biscuits and gravy. \n\nThe Country Fried Steak was very good, a nice big piece of tender beef breaded and covered in flavorful milk gravy. The pork chops were not as good, they were a thin cut and overly cooked making them dry and tough. I was hoping for a thick, juicy chop. Our eggs were  cooked over easy and done well, as were the hash browns. They're not your traditional hash browns, but are more an American Fries.\n\nThe star of the breakfast was the hearty serving of biscuits and gravy.

They did a nice job on the remodel and the space is dimly lit, sparse, and kind of sexy. There was a single TV behind the bar and I think it was intentionally black & white. During my time there the movies on the screen were Little Shop of Horrors and Ferris Bueller's Day Off. These are two movies I could sit and watch in black & white with no sound forever. I met a friend for an early weekday dinner and neither of us were that hungry so we decided to share the Taiwanese Dumplings and the Soft Shell Crab Bao. The Taiwanese Dumplings are filled with chicken and vegetables and come with a soy scallion dipping sauce. They were very well cooked and had lots of nice crispy edges. My dinner date isn't an Asiaphile, as I am, and doesn't eat quite as many dumplings as I do. She thought they were the best she'd ever had and I thought they were just the best I had this week. The bao was actually a clever concept to make into an expensive designer sandwich. The bun has a slight sweetness and a good chew from being steamed and really holds up as a sandwich bun. The soft shell crab was good albeit slightly heavy on the breading. They do not include any kind of side dish with the bao. I felt they could at least put something a little colorful on the plate even as an afterthought but that was just my opinion. The cocktail menu was quite inventive and intricate but I'm not much of a drinker.

You can make fast food that is healthy and tasty. And tasty it was. Not knock your socks off tasty, but tasty nonetheless. My \"bowl\" (which is a burrito with no tortilla) had something like brown rice (flavored with lime and cilantro), black beans, pulled pork, cheese and some sort of salsa. It was a pretty good and healthy dish and beats a double whopper with cheese on both the disgust and bloat factor. \n\nAs for the decor, I can't say I'm a fan.

The spring salad is fluffy and fresh with a touch of roasted red peppers for color and flavor.  The spaghetti portion is just my size and it's topped with an extra large meatball.  Now, if this isn't enough, you also get bread and oil.   This whole bundle of joy is a mere $8.  Boom!  Lunch around Vandy isn't the cheapest so this makes my wallet happy.  I do have to note though this isn't the best pasta in town, I mean it's good, but it's no Mama Mia's or Cafe Nonna, but it's perfect for what it is.

They sell tickets to these dinners and have them once a month in Nashville. They also do the dinners at the Cool Springs location, on back to back dates. We were greeted & escorted back to at large room in the back of the restaurant. In that room was a HUGE table with people seated. There were 26 people on each side of the table. \n\nThey had a large team of servers who brought out the different courses & drink pairings. The menu changes each month obviously & chef Steven Robilio told us that he tries to source local things for whenever they are in season. This February dinner was a little hard to get local produce, but the meat we had was local. \n\nEach course was explained & brought out. The timing was pretty good. We had 5 courses along with 5 drink pairings & it was about a two hour affair. I did notice that a lot of the people who attend the chef dinners were repeat customers. I also noticed that a lot of the clientele were seniors.\n\nMy favorites of the dinner were the pork lion & the meat balls in the Italian wedding soup. The pork lion was sous-vided & so tender. The meatballs were seasoned will & delicious. One thing that I did notice about the dinner was it was heavier than other course meals I've had in recent times. Maybe the clientele likes to feel like they're getting their monies worth, & they are. We left stuffed. \n\nOne of the drawbacks about the intimacy of the table was it was almost hard to eat the food as the chairs literally touched each other. I kept finding myself trying to to elbow the gentlemen seated next to me. I think it would be much better if they either sat people at the ends of the tables or maybe used the table located on the elevated section of the room too. \n\nFor the $50 price tag (plus 30% gratuity) I think it was a bargain in the Nashville food scene.

Dipping them in both the honey mustard and the marinara sauce they come with is a must.\n\nThe Calamari Fritti had a great crunch and wasn't over- or undercooked; there was enough chew to be comfortable but not so much that you began to worry about the health of your jaw.

Since it was late in the lunch hour, there weren't a lot of ready to go options, but I decided the sausage and pepperoni would meet my needs.  The woman behind the counter threw in the sausage slice as well since she didn't think it her best \"looking\" piece and wouldn't want to sell it.

Taormina's is a nicer Italian restaurant than most other ones in the area for sure, but the problem with it is that is can be very inconsistent at times. The biggest problem with Taormina's is consistency in terms of food quality. I've come here before and the food is great, other times the chicken tastes dried out and not as flavorful as previous visits. My most recent visit here, I got the Chicken Alfredo with Rigatoni; the chicken was dried out and flavorless, and the Alfredo felt like it had been sitting under a hot lamp for a while, not fresh. I had previously gotten the exact same dish, which I though was fantastic, but that was a few weeks before. My friend also was upset with his dish as he got the Chicken Parmesan, in which the chicken was very chewy and not edible. Again he has had it in the past and it was fine. All of this isn't even mentioning the pricing here is expensive. For literally pasta with chicken in it costs me almost $20, and they don't put that much chicken in the dish. Everything here is a la carte, so with your $20+ meal, you don't get any salad or anything, just some bread and peppers. Sometimes here the food is great, other times it is whatever. It's all the luck of the draw.\n\nThe atmosphere is pretty nice in Taormina's; they keep the place very clean and it always looks inviting. The place is pretty small, but they fit a lot of people in there and it doesn't feel too cramped. Service is decent too, never really had a major issue, and whenever their is a problem, the servers seem to be able to fix it somewhat. Basically, if Taormina's priced their meals more reasonably, I'd be a much happier camper, but for the price you pay there, I expect a much better product when I go. I hear the Ivyland location of Taormina's costs even more, so there's that.\n\nFood (B+), Pricing (D+), Atmosphere (B), Service (B)", "date": "2013-08-13 14:26:32"}, {"_key": "1161643", "_id": "reviews/1161643", "_rev": "_fNyr4F---V", "review_id": "BLpOlW7-xuOvvUlPE8WKxA", "user_id": "WqeE5e5ROfaVEgkb9dAkiQ", "business_id": "xFtfdn4pBkRIViPfOBK73w", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "Very fun - lots of teamwork and communication.

From what I saw on the noodles with a friend, it looked way too MSG-ridden with an oily sheen on the top.

The table rocket with the dumpling vinegar was a great tool for squirting into the open pouch once the top knot was bitten off to suck out the broth.  We liked them so much, we ordered another bamboo steamer of 6 after finishing everything else.  \n\nThe Beef Scallion Pancake was likewise very enjoyable.  I did not find it overly oily given it was fried in that scalding fluid, and the beef within was tender and brought to sweet life with the Hoisin Sauce in which it had been prepared.  The Crispy Salted Chicken was their take on the fried chicken craze.  The chicken was tender, but the breading a might over-fried to a too-dark brown.  The pieces were very small and included many droplets of plain dough without any meat within.  While the taste was okay, the overall impression was underwhelming.   \n\nBoth the XLB and Pancakes were winners, while the Crispy Fried Chicken left something to be desired.

I tried the typical Alpha 5 beer flight. It was $13 for 5 small tasters. It's always cool to try a variety when you're going to a place for the first time.

Sure, everyone has an exceptional seasonal beer every now and then, but for the most part it's the same stuff with a different witty name over and over again on everybody's tap lists. I still love going to as many new breweries as I can, but it's just starting to feel like it's getting a little difficult to find places that actually set themselves apart with something unique and memorable. Alpha Brewing has done just that, and they have done it very well. \n\nLocated in a little downtown neighborhood with some other options to eat and drink in the nearby vicinity (I recommend trying some of the crazy pizzas at The Sliced Pint), this brewery certainly doesn't leave any doubt about what it is when you walk up to the place. Behind their nice outdoor patio area is a storefront that is almost all windows, and behind those windows are stacks of barrels, 3 high and 2 deep, aging a whole bunch of beers that are probably nothing you will see at any other brewery in the entire city. \n\nI love barrel aged beers, and I love sour beers (done properly, none of that kettle souring), and alpha had more options than I could try in one sitting. Our fairly large group found a few tables to push together in the taproom that had a bar with a dozen or so seats, and maybe 6 or 7 smaller tables. There were a few people set up with some board games, and some regulars at the bar, but it wasn't too crowded for a Saturday night. It's a bright taproom that is on the quieter side of things. You can see their brewing operation through a window, which if I am remembering correctly consists of 2.5 barrel brew kettles and 5 gallon fermenters, so they are definitely a small batch place.\n\nThe tap list consisted of maybe 5 or 6 of their \"Beta Brews\" on tap, and a few more in bottles. These were the things out of their barrel aging program, and were all really unique beers. If those weren't up your alley, they also had about 6 or 7 \"Alpha Brews\", which is more normal stuff that wasn't barrel aged, but still included quite a few really cool beers. If you ended up getting dragged along to a brewery as a non-beer drinker, I believe I at least saw some wine being served. It's not often I find beers that I haven't had at least one similar iteration of at some point in the past, but Alpha had plenty of them, especially their barrel soured beers.\n\nTheir prices, although higher than normal beers, were actually pretty decent for their barrel aged and sour beers. They had flights available as well, but those were from preset lists that you couldn't mix and match. I was surprised to see howler and growler fill pricing for their Beta stuff as well. I ended up taking home quite a few bottles from here, and a lot of them were available already chilled if you were taking it somewhere to drink immediately. The bartender working when we were here was great. She was outgoing and talkative, and knew plenty about the beers and the brewery. \n\nI will definitely be back here the next time I am in St. Louis.", "date": "2017-04-28 14:10:57"}, {"_key": "927818", "_id": "reviews/927818", "_rev": "_fNysbk6--H", "review_id": "wSWb53GBbI2r-EnCdzRaNg", "user_id": "9bLLhB3Ji4miHY6I4jxgvA", "business_id": "YbkD76a_vnGYpMrFLETIyA", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "text": "Had an event at this brewery while I was in town for a conference and I can't say enough great things about the place and the owner/brewer.

Do they have to wash and roll them we had our food but no silverware I know I'm jumping before but then the manager came out and was trying to help the waiter. The drinks came out late no one had water then finally the chef came out his uniform was dirty with food stains all over it he was cooking our food and the food was flying everywhere he didn't know how to do the volcano he didn't know how to do the pumping heart with the rice he really needed to go back to training and start over again I think they just hired people take a little class and you're on the grill but he was not entertaining at all and the money that we pay for show and dinner was unacceptable. I don't recommend this Benihana's to no one. And then when I was eating my food I had a shrimp shell in my food that was disgusting. So it was shells all over the grill then he  placed the bowl between me and my husband and eggshells shrimp shells and everything that he cooked on the grill was all on the side of our plate. I had to tell him that all the money that were paying the food was everywhere. The money that you pay at Benihana's they should give you a lot of food the portions that you received at this location is like a children's portion I don't recommend this $40 a plate we could have went some where else and got more for money. Especially when you have a chef that absolutely don't know what he's doing but it was upsetting so we start talking amongst our self and he was doing his own thing then he told us that he had to go to another table to cook. I believe that was the last table for the night but he should have went home after he left our table. That wasn't the kicker for the night the kicker for the night was the manager put a gratuity on everyone's bill without anyone knowing it was up to us to pay what we wanted not what was on the paper this was dishonest to the customer. I think they're trying to make up the lost from the pandemic is not fair is unlegal and I want my money back!!!!!! One thing that was great about this event that my niece had a nice time just to share her birthday with some of her family members. And this was her first time here. they hurried up and wrote our bill out and did want to sing Happy Birthday are you kidding me after all we have been through all they had to do is shake the tamarine and sing Happy Birthday. So the waiter and some other waitress came over to sing Happy Birthday. I just talked to some of my family members and they had diarrhea from the food last night this is unacceptable the whole table had diarrhea what is going on the health department needs to come there and shut it down. How can a whole table be sick. And each of us stayed in the bed all day we didn't know that until we called each other to find out what happened. And another thing while me and my sister was talkin we was saying that it was not sanitized because of the pandemic. Between the customers the chairs and table tops was not wash down so we might have not been the only one sick you never know until other people read your message. And you know the craziest thing to is I usually take pictures but unfortunately I did not take not a one picture last night and I'm so mad because if you would have seen how the chef had our table top you would have known what I was talking about. But only thing I can do is voice my opinion and speak out of what my experience at this Benihana's location. In my party it was my mother, husband, sister, nephew, and my self. But we come to this location for dinner and everyone has diarrhea  unbelievable. I'm so pissed at this time. I might all have food poisoning.

We had been to other Japanese Steakhouses and were curious to see how the 'master' chain compared.

Speed and heat are the enemy of delicious protein, however even with this expectation in place, the food all fell short.  The steak was tasteless, the yakisoba was strangely peppery, the salmon chewy.  Only things that got true thumbs up:  Lobster Roll sushi, shrimp, and the chicken dishes.  Warning: \"Spicy Hibachi Chicken\" is indeed spicy.  Also, the Onion Soup is much better tasting than it sounds, more like a french onion flavor as a clear broth without cheese.\n\nThe pricing we thought was quite high for what we got.  Nine of us, only two glasses of alcohol, almost $400 with tip (they do not automatically include gratuity, we tipped 18%).   I've had the same experience with the same number of people for $275.

One word...BLAND! No seasoning at all. The rice...fried rice...was bland. The veggies, bland. The steak, bland!

To my surprise, there was definitely enough crowd to keep the business going even though the temperature was approximately 45 - 50 F.\n\nI have tried a lot of ice cream and frozen yogurt places in the Los Angeles area, but never have I tried a frozen custard before. My 1st order was a big apple concrete (apple pie mixed with vanilla custard topped with whipped cream) for $3.7. The word \"concrete\" (or blended custard) definitely lived up to its name - vanilla custard was really, REALLY thick. I personally didn't like big apple concrete because I felt like I was eating frozen apple pie more than enjoying the flavor of vanilla custard. The flavor of apple pie simply overshadowed the flavor of vanilla custard. I guess if anyone likes apple pie, then definitely order big apple concrete! \n\nSo I decided to order again and this time I ordered a peach concrete. In addition to mini ($2.3), regular ($3.7), and large ($5) sizes, there is another size called \"micro\" (it's not shown on the menu) for less than $2 with tax - basically micro is smaller version of mini. I really like my peach concrete. You can taste the peach and overall sweetness is just right.

I am truly a romantic, when I arrived at Ted Drewes I was immediately brought down to earth by the semi cult following of friendly custard lovers, a sparkling night sky, pretty neon lights and their old fashion push lettered menus. The lines at first glance appear long and crazy, but once you get closer you realize they are just people crowding around enjoying their custards, we literally only waited 5 minutes in line and I thought for sure it was going to be a half an hour wait at least. I was overwhelmed, constantly checking the yelp page to get ideas of what to order, asking others what they were savoring, and my friend Sam made a simple suggestion of getting the mint and oreo combo. I was skeptical, after all how can one pass up the decadent Christie or Uncle Sam... I was very pleased with the Mint Oreo and my only regret is that I didn't get a medium but rather went with a small because I was trying to be good. It was very velvety and delicious. We tailgated in Sam's '85 Toyota Land Cruiser and indulged in Saint Louis's finest. \n\nThe Rasberry flavor is also very delicious, simply classy and clean. I liked the Christie, but it was a bit too rich for me, it was almost too chocolaty and thick. The Uncle Sam was great, but very sweet. Some other patrons were enjoying the oreo and vanilla and when I told them I was getting mint and oreo they were just mind blown and said they wish they had ordered that... so apparently it's a secret delicious combo! \n\nThe reason why I said 'date night date night' at the beginning of this review is because Ted Drewes, this location in particular, is romantic... the location, the lights, friendly visitors, and honestly what more could one want other than to enjoy a delicious treat with your loved one(s) under a bed of stars...

I only ate about 2 or 3 inches of concrete before putting it back in the cup holder and contemplating attacking the leftover White Castle hamburgers in the back seat.\n\nFor 17 years, Ted Drewes grew into a greater legend in my mind than it turned out to be in reality.  It was great to continue the St. Louis tradition of feeding one's sweet tooth (which I do not actually have, but my boyfriend has a mouthful of) at Ted Drewes, but I can say that I won't be particularly distressed to wait another 17 years until my next visit.\n\nIf you live in St. Louis, Ted Drewes on the old Route 66 is a destination that you really shouldn't miss.

I was wondering though.. what is so great about this place??\n\nSince the Hubbster and I were new to STL and its comfort foods, we were absolutely willing to try all the good eats around town. Word of mouth from my in-laws, was that Ted Drewes was awesome. We were super excited to try it. Once we got there, I felt completely overwhelmed with that menu.. It seemed self explainable, but some flavors were just WAY out there with no details on exactly what it is.. The hubbster was considering just a plain mint, but had to definitely research all of the other wondrous flavors and specials like Cindermint, Tedads, the Christy, or a Terramizzou (which is not an incorrect spelling of Tiramisu) Believe me, it really was total research of standing aside and being one of those annoying customers of asking what each flavor consists of, but the staff was very friendly and energetic.. Yes I felt so touristy..but I guess it keeps the fun in trying out any of the frozen custards.\n\nNonetheless, we went with something tame and it had to be a \"concrete\" which basically means the custard consistency is thick, and it wont spill out,  so the S'mores flavor was something we knew and could handle. To our dismay, it was not anything amazing. It was very creamy, and you could see the bits of graham and chocolate. Being a frozen custard.. I just don't know what I am missing exactly. I have had custard before in pies, with ice cream and Italian Ice.. not sure what makes this stand out in presentation, creativity or just taste. \n\nPerks: Great portion for the $.

Bobby Flay created his own concrete, which was vanilla frozen custard mixed with Oreo, Heath bar and caramel.\n\nIt was just okay.  Given the candy bar fillings, the quality of the add-ins were pretty standard stuff.  I thought the frozen custard was too soft.  While I thought the overall flavor combination was nothing special, the frozen custard had a pretty good flavor.  Still, its lack of thickness kind of kept it from being really good frozen custard for me.\n\nThe other problem was that they did not really fill the frozen custard all the way to the top so it kind of felt like a less than generous portion.\n\nI also had their vanilla frozen custard in a cone.  While the frozen custard was too soft here as well, I think this option is a simpler and maybe even more enjoyable way to have their frozen custard.\n\nService was pleasant and quick and prices were reasonable for a frozen treat.\n\nI left Ted Drewes Frozen Custard disappointed.

You actually get little bites of marshmallow that's all integrated with the custard so it's silky and sweet, but at times, it does get lost.  Should've read the menu much more carefully..\n\nComes in variety of sizes, and while we went for the mini, it was definitely enough for us.

I was charge 50 cents for chocolate sauce that had no flavor, I didn't even know there was chocolate sauce in it...my ice cream was pure runny like slime white with pistachios...I was lucky enough to taste the pistachios. yes it was high 80's out but that should not have been the reason to have runny and flavorless ice cream served to us.

Yes, Ted Drewes is a Saint Louis icon known for creating the \"concrete\" which is a custard blended with any number of combinations that is so thick that if a spoon was inserted and the cup was turned upside down it wouldn't fall out, and that is just the way they are served to you here. \n\nOpened in 1941, this location is a landmark and gets very busy during the summer season that parking can often be difficult, the one major plus is that the lines move fast so you are never really waiting long. Credit cards are accepted here, so no need to worry about having enough cash. Prices are reasonable too so you don't have to worry about breaking the bank. If you do not want to brave the crowds, the famous custard can be found in Ballpark Village, Lambert Airport, and many St. Louis grocers. However its bet enjoyed here, where the cool creamy custard can be blended with a wide variety of flavors and toppings. Seasonal ingredients like cherry, apple, and yes even pumpkin pie have their turn depending on the time of year.\n\nOverall Ted Drewes is a well-known and highly recommended spot, however it's not my favorite custard stop in the area, that honor goes to Bobby's Frozen Custard located just across the river in Maryville, IL. Don't get me wrong the custard here is good, however I feel that there are just better options.

I'm still not too sure why it's called frozen custard where in Chicago we just call it custard even if it's cold, but no worries, I'll get with the St. Louis vibe.\n\nWe came on a Sunday afternoon around 2pm and it was pretty busy, we only had to wait about 5 minutes in line so that wasn't so bad but I can imagine it getting way too busy during the hot summer months. I saw many people were having the vanilla custard in a cone so I decided to order my personal favorite flavor, Chocolate in a cone as well. The girl says to me \"sorry, we only put Vanilla in the cones.\" Okay, that's a star off right there. I mean, how hard is it to put the same custard you put in a cup, but in a cone? So that rule seemed a little off to me. So I told her I would like a small in a cup. I think the price is decent and you get enough even for a small. I shared some with my hubby and he liked it, but for me, the chocolate looked like vanilla. Where was the cocoa? It was too much on the sweet sugary side and less on the chocolatey side. I should have just ordered their vanilla flavor in a cone but oh well. Maybe if you get some of their fancier flavors and sundaes, you will have more of an exciting experience but my regular chocolate was just so so.

I definitely prefer my frozen custard elsewhere and this place didn't really convince me to want to come back any time soon.  The woman handing me my concrete did a halfway turn instead of a complete upside down thing since she saw it was quite melted already before I got it. I don't like melted ice cream or frozen custard, I think it's gross so I ended up eating half of it and threw it in the freezer at home to hopefully salvage the slurpie with toppings.

A plain chocolate chip crete or a chocolate shake will do in a pinch. \n\nI know her kids are all born and bred Ted Drewes addicts and frankly it makes me proud. \n\nWhenever I am in town this is a must stop. You are crazy if you live nearby and never stop in.", "date": "2009-11-24 23:49:25"}, {"_key": "813288", "_id": "reviews/813288", "_rev": "_fNysYLy--M", "review_id": "-YkY3bpqs-l3PtITaLPDGQ", "user_id": "60RKNAZwY5EUooJf624aKw", "business_id": "nRKndeZLQ3eDL10UMwS2rQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "Well worth the drive from the county!

This summer stand out has been serving up thick, creamy frozen custard to millions of residents and visitors since 1929. To me, nothing says summer like leaving a hot and sticky Cardinals game to get a dish of Ted Drewes. It's the perfect way to cool down. \n\nMy favorite aspect of the Ted Drewes menu is how customizable it is. While they offer a ton of pre-concocted treats, it's so fun to mix and match toppings to create your perfect dish of custard. Choosing from over 50 unique toppings, my personal favorite combo is pretzel, caramel and hot fudge. It tastes like a frozen chocolate covered pretzel! \n\nThe lines at Ted Drewes can appear incredibly intimidating if it's your first rodeo. Fear not! The custard slingers who keep the Ted Drewes machinery humming have customer service down to a science. I'm always so impressed with how quickly they get through lines. To help customers in the COVID-era, they have installed barricades between each service window. They aren't large enough to keep the crowds out though. \n\nPro tip for first time Ted Drewes adventurers: They post the menu on both sides of the building. Definitely take a look at it before you get in line. The only menu by the service stations are tiny and you can't read them from the end of the line. It can be super stressful when you get to the front of the line and you don't know what you want yet. Don't be that person who holds up the line!\n\nThe other thing to note here is size. The interesting thing is the inconsistency and confusing sizing structure. More often than not they serve you a size larger than you order.

One, it is an Instagram photo-worthy hype. Two, the dessert tastes really amazing. Of course, it can also be a combination of both factors, but for Ted Drewes, it is simply the latter option. The dessert served here is solely vanilla custard, and you can play around and customize it by adding some sauces or toppings or by making it a concrete, shake, malt, or a few other variations. Choose from one of the menu options, or get creative and make your own flavor combination. Either way, whatever you do, the custard remains the star of the show, and what makes it so good is that it is high quality while staying simple and unpretentious. It is super creamy and looks, feels, and tastes homemade. \n\nThere really is not anything fancy in appearances about the storefront or the custard at all, but the lack of disguise is what makes it so charming. You order at a window and either eat your custard outside or take it to-go with you somewhere. The line may be long, but it moves fast. I placed my order and then received my dessert almost instantaneously. If you want to avoid the line completely, go on a day when the weather is terrible and people do not want to be outside.\n\nThere are plenty of ice cream places in any town so I will give you a fact that might convince you to make a visit like it convinced me to. According to SoolNua's 2016 annual World ICECREAM Index, Ted Drewes was rated as the world's best ice cream.

I never had hot fudge on ice cream before and this was the perfect combination. The berry syrup with the rich chocolate contrasted perfectly with the ice cream and I really appreciate the whole chunks of cherry they had in there.\n- Peach - I didn't like this one as much, I thought it would be peach flavored rather than mixed in peaches, but once again, I appreciate the whole fruit they put into the custard.\n\nTo be honest, I think I like ice cream a little bit more (it wasn't mindblowing), but not mad about this place at all!

More importantly, what can a girl who doesn't really like cold things (ice cream included) say about Ted Drewes?\n\nFirst, this place is a must-stop when you're in St. Louis if you LOVE ice cream/custard (and probably still a must-stop if you're like me and only kind of like ice cream). Every time I take an out-of-town guest here, they just rave about it. I think this is due to the fact that their custard is pretty darn good and very affordable. \n\nSecond, Ted Drewes has a HUGE selection of choices, which is fantastic. You know those Coke machines at some fast food places where they rave that there are over 200 different types of drinks you can choose from? Think of Ted Drewes as the custard version of that Coke machine. There are sooooooo many different delicious things you can mix into their custard (nuts, cookie dough, pistachios, cookies, strawberries, pecans, M&Ms, etc.). The list of different toppings and flavors just goes on and on and on. In addition to a plethora of toppings, you can order a sundae, a shortcake, a banana split, a concrete mixer, etc. Again, the possibilities are endless. In addition to all of these regular choices, they also rotate out several items. For example, the last time I was there they had a salted caramel pretzel custard dish. I truly regret not trying it. \n\nIn terms of service, I've generally been pretty impressed with the speed and friendliness of the staff. There could be over 100 people in line and I've still gotten my custard easily within 10 minutes. With that said, choosing which line to stand in is a lot like Russian Roulette. Sometimes the line takes 2 minutes, but pick the wrong line, and it might take closer to 15. \n\nIn terms of downsides, I can think of only 3. First, there isn't a designated area for picking up your custard after you order it. This creates a cluster-fudge as you end up bumping up against both people who are also waiting for their order, as well as those who haven't ordered yet. Another downside to this place is there is limited to no seating. This means you either eat your custard standing up or eat it in your car and pray that you don't spill the custardy goodness all over your seat. Finally, the parking can be kind of a nightmare given how popular this place is.\n\nTwo other important notes. First, there are two Ted Drewes locations. The other one is on South Grand Blvd. Second, it is worth asking the staff what constitutes a small, medium, and large. We ordered a large and were completely overwhelmed by the amount of custard (which is my fault). I just found out that they have a micro mini size, and will definitely be ordering that size next time :).", "date": "2015-04-02 03:00:05"}, {"_key": "885961", "_id": "reviews/885961", "_rev": "_fNysaU---D", "review_id": "sK7Zy7bYQbBgYfLrIj6SfA", "user_id": "ny6Ro6jrcqrVGaAN34wc2Q", "business_id": "nRKndeZLQ3eDL10UMwS2rQ", "stars": 2, "useful": 5, "funny": 4, "cool": 1, "text": "Wow.

For appetizers, we both ordered Caesar salads ($7 each). I ordered mine without cheese and with dressing on the side (I'm not supposed to eat dairy), and not only was he nice about me being high maintenance, the salad also came out correctly. For our entrees, I ordered potato gnocchi in pesto sauce ($12) and my friend ordered the lobster ravioli ($14). I didn't try her ravioli, but she said it was her favorite dish there. My gnocchi was delicious but the sauce was a tiny bit heavier than I was hoping (but still good). We ate ourselves full and still had plenty of pasta left to take home. \n\nOverall, Bistro La Baia was cute, small, inexpensive, and had minimal frills.

With promising reviews, we decided to try this option on the outskirts of Rittenhouse Square. Lobster ravioli for me, and penne arrabiata for the significant other. The food was ready right on time when I arrived, and came with a complimentary bundled of delicious slices of Italian bread that practically crackles when bitten into.\n\nThe entrees were quite good as well. The ravioli consisted of six pieces, two sauteed shrimp and a rich, creamy tomato sauce. That and half a piece of the Italian bread made for a perfectly portioned and delicious meal for me. The penne arrabiata was a larger portion, and while not the best ever, it still met with the S.O.'s overall approval.\n\nThe sidewalk seating wooden pods were empty when I arrived, but that was before 6PM, so maybe the restaurant was busier later in the evening.

The Arancini was not crisp on the outside, but the flavor was good and the sauce was delicious. The Eggplant Rollatini was delicious and similar to the arancini, the sauce was perfection. I'm super picky when it comes to tomato sauce and I would genuinely eat this with a spoon. For entrees, my boyfriend had the Pappardelle con Salsiccia. The pasta was fresh, sausage was flavorful, and the sauce was delicious. The dish was very hot temperature wise as well, which was great because we made our walk over in the snow. For my entree, I had the Chicken Parmesan which was a gamble on my part. I tend to skip ordering chicken parm out, because I'm really picky. However, the picture of the dish on their website intrigued me so I went for it. I'm so glad that I did! The chicken was not crispy, but it was thinly sliced and portioned well. I ordered a side of veggies with it instead of the pasta. The veggies were so well seasoned! For dessert, we tried the Chocolate Cake and Panna Cotta. Both were great, but we both preferred the chocolate cake.\n\nFrom start to finish, the service was attentive, the food was delicious, and the portions for the price were perfect.

The atmosphere was a bit strange, as we first noticed the outdoor patio area, which had a nicely dressed young lady playing classical piano. The inside also looked elegant. But then there were large TV's everywhere with sports on. It was as if a sports bar and a fine dining restaurant had a baby - but a strange one.\n\nThe staff, although friendly, seemed very young, unprofessional, and poorly trained. They were good kids, just didn't really fit the establishment. For instance, when someone in our party asked about the fish of the day, the server told us it was an Atlantic Sea Bass - which we ordered. We waited a while for our food, and about the time I was expecting it would be coming out, the server returned only to tell us that the fish of the day was actually a Cod. What? It was strange that A) he didn't know the fish of the day, B) he waited so long to tell us there was a mistake, and C) he didn't apologize for the error. Something else was ordered in its place, but it was then delivered later than the other entrees which came out. It was poor execution. Also, when we initially sat down and were poured waters, the water was warm - no even room temperature, but actually warm. When they refilled them, it was cold water with ice in it, but it seems like the initial pitcher must have been sitting out for a long time.\n\nI had ordered the salmon salad, which was much smaller than what I had imagined an entree salad to be. The salmon was mediocre, and the small salad was missing one of the key ingredients the menu mentioned it included. I'm not sure if they were just out of the ingredient and they didn't want to tell me, or if it was just another mistake. The food was definitely overpriced for what it was.\n\nIn conclusion, the restaurant seemed confused on whether they were a classical piano playing fine dining restaurant or a sports bar.

A little wedge of lemon brought a bright burst of citrus that was splendid. I started with the small Branica salad ($3.95), a lucious blend of greens with tomato, onion, mozzarella and house-made dressing.

I didn't finish it, didn't even eat half of it -- maybe three or four spoonsful. It wasn't worth the calories. One of my dining partners tried it and declared it also . . . fine.\n\nI took home enough leftovers to serve as my dinner -- so two meals for the price of one.\n\nMy dining partners got:\nThe chicken special -- light chicken meat prepared with a light tomato sauce (with chunks of tomato) and eggplant, with the potatoes and broccoli.\nFettucine Genovesi at $7.75 for the lunch portion -- with sun-dried tomatoes, mushrooms and pine nuts in a rich cream sauce.\n\nEverybody raved about their meals, including our vegetarian dining partner, who had the large spinach salad and an order of broccoli.\n\nOn other visits, I've had and thoroughly enjoyed (and always with the small Branica salad):\nVeal Al Limone at $9.95 for the lunch portion -- in light lemon sauce, with shitake mushrooms.\nGrilled Salmon at $9.95 for the lunch portion --  topped with lemon butter capers.\nChicken Tortellloni at $7.95 for the lunch portion -- in cream sauce with peas and mushrooms.\nPizza Branica at $8.95 -- chicken. gorgonzola, mushrooms and olive.\n\nOne time we were seated inside the restaurant, which is (to me) more formal and old-world, but lovely and rich. The patio seems more festive and casual relaxed -- even if it's not really outside. There are awnings, for goodness sake. Get an imagination!!

You pick out your dough (regular or gluten free), choose your sauce, cheeses, meats, veggies, and seasonings.  To build your own pizza, unlimited toppings generally speaking, is $7.95.  If you just want a one topping pizza it is $6.95 and a cheese pizza is $5.  All the pizzas are 11 inches, so it is big enough to share if you just want a little bit or small enough to eat by yourself if you are hungry.  They also offer a few salad options, but we did not explore those since we were in the mood for pizza.  \n\nOnce you add all your toppings they bring it over to this open faced, wood burning, oven and cook your pizza for a couple of minutes.  You can ask them to cook it longer, but with the thin crust it pretty much comes out perfect unless you add a bunch of toppings.  Then you should have it cooked a couple of mins more so that the crust isn't soggy.\n\nOverall flavor is awesome!  I like to get the spicy red sauce on my pizza and then cover it with the meats.

When it came to sauce I chose the classic red and I thought it was very good. I consider their meat and cheese selection impressive for a very inexpensive pizza place.

Most of the girls ordered the shrimp po' boy so I \"dared to be different\" by ordering the pork belly - regretting that big time.

The sauce on the bread was the only thing edible to me in the sandwich so I ended up just throwing out the meat and feasting on the bread.. Sad right? lol\n\nThen, to add insult to injury, the cashier was rude and made every request we had so difficult! One example, we asked for extra sauce on the side. Her answer was, \"There's already sauce on the sandwich\"... Umm pardon my French but no s***. I am asking for MORE on the side. She ended up doing it finally, but it felt like she did it very reluctantly and intentionally super slow (she knew we were in a rush to make the tour on time).\n\nPerhaps, if I had gotten the shrimp one I wouldn't have been so unhappy with mine.

One of the Top 3 things I ate in NOLA! \n\nHOLY SHIZ BALLS... IT WAS CRACK GOOD...\n\nHere's how good it was:\n\nAt around midnight, my fiance and I were pondering a 4th meal. We had heard of Killer Poboys and were curious to try a non-traditional po' boy. We weren't hungry so we decided to split a Dark & Stormy Po' Boy. \n\nOne bite later... EXPLOSIONS IN MY MOUTH! STARS IN MY EYES! SO FREAKING GOOD! \n\nThe umami flavors of the pork belly SUNG to my Asian palate. The marinade had notes of rum, ginger, belly, soy sauce, five spice, and brown sugar. The marinade clung seductively to the unctuousness of the pork belly, coating it in a sweet, but not cloying glaze. I am Filipina. Trust me, I know my pork. So often, pork belly is not done right. Either the fat is not rendered out enough, leaving the fatty layer rubbery, or the meat is overdone and chewy. Killer Poboys does their pork belly justice. Decadent, almost melting, quivering layer of pork fat over a tender piece of side pork. The sweet glaze and decadence of the rich pork belly were the perfect contrast to the fresh squeeze of lime juice, the cool, creamy house aioli sauce, and a crunchy, sour cabbage slaw. We DEVOURED our halves of the Dark & Stormy, looked at each other, and said, \"Let's try another one!\" Mind you, prior to entering Killer Poboys we weren't even hungry. And now this crack sandwich had invigorated a hunger inside of us that we didn't know existed. \n\nNext, we tried the Coriander Lime Gulf Shrimp Poboy. Also a hit, but not as good as the Dark & Stormy. It tasted like a healthy version of the classic fried shrimp po' boy because the shrimp was sauteed. It reminded me of a grilled shrimp Banh Mi, with the marinated radish, carrot and cucumber adding a nice acidic contrast to the brininess of the shrimp. \n\nBUT WAIT... WE STLL DIDN'T STOP THERE..\n\nNext we tried the Moroccan Lamb Po' Boy, the special of the day. Delicate ground lamb was mixed with an assortment of Moroccan spices, griddled into crisp patties and dressed with sumac-scented carrots and tzatziki sauce. Mmmmm, definitely our second favorite po' boy here. \n\nDon't let the location keep you from paying homage to this place.

We first heard about this place from our Uber driver who raved about the sandwiches and told us that we have to try it before we leave NOLA.  I am glad that she warned us about it being behind the bar because I didn't notice any sign for the place when I walked up to the Erin Rose bar.

The pork belly was out of this world!!  The seasoning of the pork belly reminds me of the traditional Chinese pork belly dish, i.e. the perfect combination of sweet and savory.  Moreover, the accompanied slaw had a nice crunchiness and just the right amount of sourness to offset the heaviness of the pork belly.  Last, but not least, the french bread was perfection.  It was held up extremely against the juice from the pork belly and slaw, but not so hard that you can't bite into it.  I can't tell you how many times the bread of the po'boy fell apart when I bite into it.  \n\nThe shrimp po'boy was good, but definitely not on the same level as the pork belly one.  It was definitely a lighter alternative, as the shrimps were lightly seasoned with mayo instead of being deep fried.  Interestingly, the girls in the group (3 of them) liked the shrimp po'boy, while the boys liked the pork belly.  I was the only one that went against the stereotype and preferred the pork belly.  But then again, my personal philosophy is when pork belly is on the menu, ALWAYS get the pork belly!  Overall, the pork belly po'boy was my absolute favorite item that I've tried in NOLA.

Since I don't have a car, I would never have known about it if it hadn't been for friends who HIGHLY recommended it (for good reason, I discovered!). However, they do have a parking lot, so at least that's off your list of worries. \n\nThe inside of the restaurant is spacious and pristine, giving off a casual ambiance with a touch of traditional Korean elements. Hence, it can accommodate small groups fairly easily. For example, on my first visit, I think I came with a group of 6-7 and we all fit comfortably around a table, and could have probably seated just as many more on the adjacent table.\n\nAnd now, the menu! As the name of the establishment suggests, its specialty is the soft tofu (soon doo boo) and it is SUCH a great deal at $10 for their different kinds! Kimchi soft tofu, seafood soft tofu, clam soft tofu, beef soft tofu, etc... yum! And they do it legit too - providing you with a raw egg that you crack into the stone pot of hot soup. Oh, and before I forget to mention, you can also adjust the level of spiciness when you order (if you don't specify, they will just give you the average spicy level, I believe). If you're not in the mood for soon doo boo, they do have other Korean food options on the menu. Admittedly, I typically gravitate immediately to the soft tofu whenever I visit, but I've tried the dak galbi once, which was also delicious and fairly generous in its portions.\n\nSpeaking of portion sizes, the restaurant is famous for their amazing side dishes that they refill if you ask when you finish (can't imagine how many plates they have to wash!). With the side dishes and the rice that comes with your main meal, it's a lot of food in my opinion. So basically, go hungry :)\n\nAnd a final adorable touch is that they typically give you a little mint candy with the check, which gives the feast the proper conclusion that it deserves.

Los Angeles) to Philly a few months ago, I've tried over a few dozen Korean restaurants and I've been fairly disappointed in every single one of them. All of them had ok to terrible tasting Korean food and they were all overpriced for the quality that they served. I was about to give up on all Korean food in the East Coast and write it up as a hopeless endeavor.\n\nAnd that all changed when I came here.\n\nI was told about Jong Ka Jib by a friend who knew I was looking for good soon doo bu and how I'd been so disappointed in all of the Korean places around the area. I honestly didn't think this place would be any different but I was thinking, \"Hey, at this point, I might as well start conditioning my mind into thinking this is good Korean food.\" and I went.\n\nI was blown away. Not only is Jong Ka Jib the best Korean food I've had at a restaurant since moving out from LA, but I would definitely consider it one of the top ten soon doo bu places I've ever been to in my life. Granted, it's not in the top 3 in my opinion but it's definitely up there. I had the pork soon doo bu extra spicy and ordered a side of kalbi ($15). The soup base was very tasty and it wasn't too watery or thick. And the tofu was cooked to perfection. They give out perfect portions too so after you finish eating, you should be pretty full.\n\nDon't be surprised or put-off when you come in and see a ton of non-Koreans eating here (white and Chinese) if you're not used to that. I myself, coming from LA, if I went to a Korean place and saw the customer base were mostly non-Koreans, I walked out because from experience, the food did not taste like Korean food but very Americanized. This place doesn't follow that trend.\n\nThe service here is just ok, or maybe even below ok but that's what I've come to expect and experience when I was in LA going to good Korean restaurants. It's rare to find a Korean place that has great service and great food. The galbi was terrible though. Don't get it. First off, it's not marinated very well and the flavors come across a bit funky. Second, it is way overpriced for the amount and quality of the meat. I shared the kalbi with two other people and we didn't even finish the galbi. That's how bad it was. As long as you stick with the soondoobu, and the occasional pajun (Korean pancake), you'll be very happy.\n\nAfter my oh so amazing experience here, I came here two more time thinking maybe it was a fluke. And no, it wasn't. I think I've found my home here.\n\nParking: Limited lot or street\nPrice: $10 per person\nWait: 10 mins after order (during rush hour you will wait an hour to be seated so beware)", "date": "2013-11-17 00:45:48"}, {"_key": "658628", "_id": "reviews/658628", "_rev": "_fNysTeK--G", "review_id": "PLcCVZRwZ7liZ3hyTAoDNA", "user_id": "NMOxipsnXc6olWdHYzXiYA", "business_id": "QWqKTWQ2OiDgo3dzNkpung", "stars": 3, "useful": 1, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "text": "I noticed this place the first time I went all the way up to this area to check out Cafe Soho as it's only about a minute away from it.  I love tofu and Korean food, and after reading the good Yelp reviews, I knew it was a place I had to check out especially now with Miga in downtown Philly being closed.  \n\nThe decor is all wooden and what I assume is old traditional Korean style.  We were seated immediately and given menus.  In less than a minute we were brought a pitcher of water and the waiter was ready to take our order.  However, I wasn't that familiar with the menu, so we weren't ready yet.  I decided on the pa-jun (Korean pancake), that I seem to order at every Korean restaurant I go to because I like it so much, and an order of the vegetarian mushroom soft tofu stew.  The waiter asked us if we were sure we didn't want seafood and not the vegetarian pajun.  I will eat seafood, but I'm not too fond of the octopus and squid that usually end up in Korean food.  I told him I preferred the vegetable one.\n\nAbout 6 Banchan (Korean side dishes) were brought out including:  Kimchi, beansprout salad, seaweed salad, and a few other things that I'm not sure exactly what they were.  They were okay, but I've had better at other places. We were also brought a raw egg, which I assumed was for our stew.   Our food came out within five minutes, and then the waiter was never to be seen again until we flagged him down for a check.  \n\nThe pajun was okay, but only had scallions in it.  At other restaurants when I order the vegetarian one, other veggies like kimchi, peppers, mushrooms, or carrots are usually included as well, so that was a bit disappointing.  The tofu stew was good and boiling hot in temperature and spice, but I didn't think it was superior to ones at other restaurants.  I did like the rice in the stone bowl, but it was really hard to get it off the sides and no one came around and poured the warm water/tea in our stone bowl at the end of the meal like others had written about.  We also were not instructed what to do with the egg (I wasn't sure if it was for the rice in the stone bowl or the stew), and the server dropped off the food so quickly and ran off that I couldn't even ask.  I wasn't getting any 3G on my phone, so I couldn't check back here on Yelp, so I guessed and put it in the stew.  It tasted good though.\n\nThe best part of the meal was the low price.  We only paid a little over $20 for the whole meal for the two of us and we left feeling full.  I would go back if I was in the area for the stew again, but I don't think I'm going to drive out of the way for it since the service was a little lackluster and I can get similar dishes at other places.", "date": "2012-08-25 20:29:05"}, {"_key": "668488", "_id": "reviews/668488", "_rev": "_fNysTuu--G", "review_id": "TIVu9EqA2gnzFqPKyb0bxg", "user_id": "-OZPBHH7RzyPIai4AlPWKA", "business_id": "QWqKTWQ2OiDgo3dzNkpung", "stars": 5, "useful": 12, "funny": 14, "cool": 12, "text": "I ate here 5 hours ago and I'm considering making the 25 minute drive to eat here again right now. \n\nLots of vegetarian options, so you're good there if you have a ton of vegetable eating friends like I do.", "date": "2014-06-15 22:31:10"}, {"_key": "752559", "_id": "reviews/752559", "_rev": "_fNysWG6--g", "review_id": "Gbh0ank-UAv02XigJwTwAg", "user_id": "N7NnC6-q0O-Gq2n_7YJkNg", "business_id": "QWqKTWQ2OiDgo3dzNkpung", "stars": 5, "useful": 12, "funny": 3, "cool": 3, "text": "Decided to write my first review on a soft tofu restaurant (typical Korean I am) because I go here about once a month and also because I am doing NOTHING at work today.\n\nI think this place has the best soft tofu in the PA/NJ/NY area.

At $10 a pop, it's not a bad deal, even though back in the day it was $8, then $9... inflation!\n\nAll of them are good, and it really is a matter of personal taste, but here are my favorites:\n- Kimchi soon du bu - The best thing about the kimchi soon du bu here is that it also comes with beef. Many other places that serve kimchi soon du bu just have the kimchi in the soup. The beef definitely adds to it.\n- Beef soon du bu - Also very good.\n- Soy bean (daeng jang) soon du bu - This is sort of an acquired taste, and doesn't come with any meat in it... but I love that salty soy bean taste!\n\nThe other thing that happens at many Korean restaurants is that you get to choose the level of heat. If you're a novice, I'd suggest the 2 or 3. If you love spicy foods, try the 5... the soup comes out deep red.\n\nThrow in the raw egg and let it cook in the stew... it adds another dimension.

I was going to give it a 3 but I'll give it a 4 for benefit of the doubt.\n\nFor those of you who frequented Dhaba before, here's the lowdown on the transition: the menu is smaller. They took out all the awesome little street snacks (REST IN PEACE) and some of the main dishes, but still have dosa, a lot of vegetarian and meat entrees, and of course biryani. Another change is that it looks like the price has increased slightly, which isn't a huge deal, but Dhaba was already pricy, so dinner for 2 here last night was $30. They still have a buffet at lunch, and it seems like a lot of the same stuff probably carries over to that. Didn't recognize any of the employees, but some of the dishes were similar if not the same, so clearly there are connections between the two.\n\nI ordered the chicken biryani. PSA, it's definitely big enough for 2 people to share if not literally 3 people. I mean, it's massive. For some reason I thought it wasn't quite as flavorful as Dhaba's biryani (interesting since it's called Biryani Hut), but was still pretty tasty. Unfortunately I didn't even make it to the chicken, which was all at the bottom of the (very deep) bowl. I took home not one but two to-go boxes full of biryani.\n\nMy friend had the chicken 65, which is an item carried over from the Dhaba menu. This was still really good. The waiter asked what spice level she wanted: mild or American mild...LOL. The American mild surprisingly still packs a bit of heat, but that's not surprising because this chicken is literally red from all the spices.\n\nIf you're going to order naan, don't bother with the regular, try the butter or garlic or some other kind. The regular naan was not good. It was super thin. (Downgrade from Dhaba' s pillowy naan, sigh.)\n\nI need to try some more things here to really sort out my opinion of it.

The interior is brightly colored and there are several TV's on the wall. It took the staff a little bit of time to greet us. We told them we did not have a reservation and hoped we could get a table. The restaurant was only 1/2 full. After a brief discussion they were able to seat us.\n\nThe Boiling House, like other restaurants (Hot & Juicy, Bistro SouthEast, Crabby Cafe, etc) of this style puts a big piece of paper over the table and provides a bucket for the shells. We ordered the shrimp and snow crab boil, garlic noodles, sweet potato fries and spring rolls.\n\nThe Good - The food was excellent, we had the Cajun sauce for the boil and it was delicious and the seafood tasted fresh. We asked for medium heat and this was not spicy, if you like heat you should ask for a higher level. The garlic noodles were very good also and the sweet potato fries were outstanding. The one disappointing point about the boil was that potatoes, corn and sausage were all an extra charge. Usually there are a few pieces of these items included in the other boil type restaurants we have tried.\n\nService was spotty the whole night. Our original waiter disappeared and we had a couple of other ones. I don't know where he went. The food took about 25-30 minutes to come out which isn't terrible. However the spacing was a bit off. The first item to arrive was the garlic noodles. Then after about 10 minutes the spring rolls and the two boil items came out together. It would have been better if the spring rolls came out first and then the noodles with the seafood.\n\nThe staff at the Boiling House seemed a bit overwhelmed also and that is probably due to some growing pains. They didn't give us bibs, or plastic gloves that some other tables had. These usually come in the bucket; we had to ask for the bibs. \n\nWe did have a nice meal at the Boiling House and for right now patience is a virtue.

This order was about $150 and fed 4 people. I highly recommend the Boiling House sauce and spicy. The seafood was just amazing, everything tasted fresh and they had some huge crawfish. The sauce was very buttery and flavorful. The main surprise hit was actually the garlic noodles.

I'd advise choosing take-out, as the policy on bussing tables appears to be, \"wait until 80% of the tables are covered in trash before cleaning.\"\n\nThe menu includes all the usual suspects, with large screens displaying photos of available dishes. Our order arrived from the kitchen really fast. So fast, I wondered if any actual cooking had occurred in that timespan. It isn't uncommon for Mexican food to be prepared in advance, then assembled and placed in a broiler to melt the cheese and heat everything--including the plate--to piping hot perfection. But based on our experience, it's more likely a microwave oven was involved.\n\nOur shared plate of carnitas nachos featured round--clearly store-bought--tortilla chips covered with an ample supply of tasty pork, sour cream, pico de gallo, and room-temperature nacho cheese that must have been poured straight from a can. The flavors were actually quite good--we ate the whole thing--but I can't recall ever being served cold nachos. It was essentially a dressed-up version of 7-11 chips and cheese, sans the heat of a convenience store cheese dispenser ($5.95).\n\nDespite my best instincts, I ordered chiles relleno with sauce on the side to see if the poblanos were fried crispy before being soaked. The result was just as mushy as most I've seen in town, further confirming my suspicion that the chiles are being fried and refrigerated in advance, then microwaved and dunked in sauce to hide the crime. Extra disappointing in this instance, being the sauce was not your average mess of tomato puree. It was smooth, spicy, full of onion and good enough to make me enjoy the dish despite the lack of fresh-fried texture ($6.99).\n\nThe chicken in my wife's enchiladas was very dry, and the fact the topping of shredded cheese went from melty on the plate's outside edge, to completely unmelted in the center, only furthered my suspicions on the use of high-frequency radio waves as a heat source ($6.99). On both dinner plates the rice and beans were par for the course.\n\nKeeping the urgent care number on speed dial, I went ahead and tried a room-temp ceviche tostada ($2.49). Despite my concerns, the fish appeared to be reasonably fresh and was combined with a great mix of veg and plenty of cilantro. Actually quite good. Sadly, the cabeza sope I ordered was so gnarly I couldn't finish it ($1.99). Piled high with lettuce, cheese, and meat, it looked promising on the plate. But the thick-fried masa was very difficult to bite through, possessing mostly the flavor of old, burned oil. \n\nSimilarly, an order of tacos al pastor tasted overcooked and a tad burned ($1.25 each), with tiny pebbles of meat that--though still edible--didn't have a hint of spice or pineapple. \n\nPerhaps the most successful dish was caldo camaron, a soup of shrimp and vegetables ($9.49). The shrimp wasn't overcooked, and the broth was spicy without being overbearing. Oddly, the veggies were cut in very large pieces, with carrots and squash the length of my fingers, and several whole red potatoes. Odd, but not a deal breaker. The soup wasn't served as hot as I'd like, but it was the warmest dish we were served.", "date": "2016-06-09 20:53:48"}, {"_key": "1138323", "_id": "reviews/1138323", "_rev": "_fNyr3Ra--a", "review_id": "lxgD78qp37egfWw_VpEHFQ", "user_id": "8VNmuYmFboXleIFf-stnFg", "business_id": "hT5UJB4LmoB6MTeDZIi1BA", "stars": 3, "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 3, "text": "Taqueria La Michoacana has been hidden in plain sight from me for more than a decade.

Not too much to say about the interior of this location, as like most fast food places, they stick to the formula, and it's pleasant.  Order taking was very prompt, and the food prep/delivery was lightning fast in spite of the fairly busy crowd.

I know Chipotle's commitment to organic and local ingredients, and their preference for meats raised without antibiotics or hormones.   So I always anticipate Chipotle should wow me with significantly better flavors, but inevitably, I still end up tilting to Qdoba for my preference.  The only thing I can attribute that preference to would be the seasonings they use, both which kind and freshness.

Note- this review is specifically based on the buffet.\n\n400- BOOM.  Thought I'd mark this milestone with one of my favorite places in Indy.  A friend (yes, he happens to be Indian) recommended this place to me.  He claimed this to be the best Indian in the naptown area.  I had to examine the claim.\n\nAMBIANCE- The place is in a strip mall, but when you walk in, the place is bright and open (unlike many Indian restaurants I've been to).  Seating is probably about 50-60ish, though they may have a backroom (I cant' recall).\n\nSERVICE- for a buffet, I didn't really expect much service.  The servers were friendly though, and were very quick to replenish the naan (more on that later).\n\nMENU- this place has to have one of the more exhaustive selections as far as a buffet goes.  Many of your favorites can be found here- palak paneer, rav korma, pakora, tikka masala, goat curry, tandoori chicken etc....  They have an interesting \"Chicken 65\" which in my opinion is like boneless buffalo wings Indian style.  Standard desserts such as mango pudding and kheer (rice pudding) can be found, as well as chai to finish up the meal.  Oh yeah, the naan.  They bring out fresh orders of naan (either garlic or regular) with the buffet as well.\n\nFOOD- most everything is delicious.  I must say I was a little disappointed with the palak paneer as it seemed to be a little too pureed in my opinion, and it being a buffet, the food tends to lack a little heat, but you can always add some spice if you need to.  The garlic naan is really strong, but very good as well.  The kheer has raisins, but you can pick them out if that ain't your thang.\n\nOVERALL- come hungry, leave happy.  This place rocks.  $9 for lunch (plus you can get a $1 off coupon at indycoupons.com) is money well spent.

We had planned to dine in at some point but on the spur of the moment one evening, decided that Indian takeout was in order. The ordering process went smoothly, pick-up was quick and timely, and everything was packaged well to make the trip home to our kitchen a breeze. Even with a 10-minute drive, the food stayed hot.\n\nI had the Chicken Korma and my husband had half a Tandori Chicken and the Mattar Paneer. We split an order of the vegetable samosas for an appetizer. Overall, we were satisfied with the meal, but comparing it to Indian food from back in Philly, it seemed a little bland to us. Though my husband was pleasantly surprised to find out how spicy they made his meal (they asked about heat level when we ordered). He likes things pretty hot, so he found it to be just right. I asked for regular or moderate spiciness and didn't find any heat in my dish. The hubs thought the paneer was a little chewy compared to other paneer dishes he has had in the past. Our overall biggest disappointment was with the samosas. I love samosas and for me, these missed the mark. Low on spice and flavor and really heavy on potato in the filling. I also noted that they didn't seem fried all the way; the dough was kind of chewy on the inside (and for the record, it didn't seem like a lack of crispiness that you might expect as a peril of takeout, because they actually were crispy on the outside).\n\nSo, I would probably go back to Amber and give them another chance before I made a final call, but it was just a good experience, not great.

I wish to hear every detail so that we all may bear witness to the errors of your ways.\"\n\n\"Your majesty\" I explained, \"it's as I've stated before and my story shan't be altered.  On the eve of February 15th, my ship's crew and I witnessed a light like that of a wax candle dancing on the horizon though with a body so small, we could not affirm it to be land.  I called to my First Officer and bid he look that way, which he indeed did and saw it.\"\n\n\"...And you described this most mystifying light to your crew, as well as within your personal log, as resembling the Jewish Menorah?\" the King sternly enquired.\n\n\"I did, your Excellency...\", I replied puzzlingly.\n\nShrieks and gasps ruptured the silence throughout the magnificent dining hall; four monks gathered near the threshold to the Infirmary nearly lost their composure before the Abbot rushed to their aid.  \"Blashphemy!\" cried the Arch Bishop.  \"'Tis the work of false Gods and malevolent magic, m 'Lord!  Add sorcery to the list of charges against him!\"\n\n\"Would you be so kind as to allow this man to finish his thought, sir?\" asked Pope Clement.  \"Please, continue on.\"\n\n\"According to our map, we had sailed upon the seas of Magazine\" I began again.  \"With small boats and provisions, we set out to investigate the strange light upon the island we dubbed Jackson.  Just off the sandy shore, we came upon a jovial tavern which housed several brightly lit lanterns, which I believe was the source of the inexplicable light which my crew and I witnessed at sea.  As we ventured inside this most cryptic tavern, a female of alluring beauty rushed to our side and offered placement on the establishment's second floor where every variety of beer, mead, godale and other intoxicating beverages flowed like the Rhine river.\"\n\n\"Never have I heard such a tale of villainy and perversion!\" shouted the Arch Bishop.  \"A tavern of wenches wielding the Devil's arcane witchcraft and yet again, you fell victim!?  Just forty-five moons ago, you were seen in Rochester Castle consorting with women and drinking heavily at the keep's tavern, 'The Complacent Mammary'!  What say you?!\"\n\n\"The Holy scripture states that he who is without sin may cast the first stone\" I replied.  \"While I do not deny those charges, I believe one must know evil before he can condemn it.  Further, this new establishment my crew and I discovered was not a tavern but rather typical of an Inn that goes by the name of 'Charcoal'.  The Inn's butcher prepares potent meats for seafaring and battle weary men in the form of what they call \"burgers\".  These \"burgers\" are produced of only the finest quality meats, such as beef, venison, kobe, elk, turkey, bison, and of course, antelope.  These meat patties are then topped with the local monastery's freshest vegetables, cheeses and condiments; all of which are situated beneath a crisp, buttery bread bun of your choice.  If this court deems me guilty and my existence extinguished, with my last words I say this: I am not wicked to love such flavors as the Gorgonzola Piccante or the Aged Goat.

Toppings: lettuce, ketchup, mayo, creole mustard, pepper jack cheese, jalapenos on a Hawaiian sweet bun topped with an order of Slap Ya Mama fries to share.

I ordered the bison burger and proceeded to get nickel and dimed to death on toppings. Then I chose fries rather than the free chips that I didn't know were free due to the small print. My order took 45 minutes before it was ready. My friend complained and he was given a free dose of grease via the chips that were nothing to write home about. They are of a potato medley though the only ones out the medley that are decent were the sweet potato chips. When I finally got my burger it was good though you couldn't tell it was bison. I had my suspicion as to if it was actually bison due to the light color of the meat when bison has a much darker color. I have eaten many a bison burger from Ted's Montana Grill and you can tell when you get bison over beef there. The meat also didn't have that little hint on tang that bison normally has. The so called slap ya mamma fries were tasteless at its name, I had to dip them into a hot sauced mixed ketchup to provide any spice. Overall the bad reviews are true and its best to just stay away from this place. The only good thing that has changed since the early reviews is that at least for me and from what I saw the patty is much bigger than some I've seen posted on here.

When a new place opens it needs a minute to find it's groove. You can't go into a place on the first day and expect everything to be flowing like clock work. There are going to be hiccups. To go into a place on the day it opens and then rate it two stars when everything doesn't go perfectly is a little unfair in my opinion. Yes, they are going to run out of things. Yes, they are going to be a little slow. If the place has been open less than a month, please go in prepared for that.  Just putting that out there.\n\nToday I had the delight of trying the new burger place in town: Charcoal's. As soon as I heard about the unique menu, I was in. I couldn't wait to try it out. Among some of the items besides the basic beef are antelope, elk, bison, salmon, venison and veggie.\n\nBeing the adventurous spirit I am, I decided to try the antelope burger. I got it topped with cheese, lettuce, tomato, ketchup and mayo on the brioche bun. You can get all kinds of fancy ingredients on it like bacon and avocado and grilled onions, but I decided to keep it simple.\n\nThe burger itself was so good. It didn't taste crazy or anything like that. It had a bit of a \"gamey\" taste, but nothing overwhelming. It was a really thick, juicy patty and it was cooked to perfection. The bun was soft and flavorful and really good. I got a side of sweet potato tater tots. I had never had them before, and they were obviously house made and delicious. They were almost like small sweet potato hash browns. They were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.

The house we were staying in was just down the street, so when hunger hit and the lines were too long at the deli across the way, we found ourselves here. \n\nThe restaurant is split into two zones. The first floor, which is a more casual counter service and the second floor, a table service kind of area. We ate at both over the two visits. \n\nOne rub I heard from local friends and felt myself, is the buildout of the space. The materials used give a polished almost chain produced feel and doesn't lend much character to the space, which just about every other eatery in the area has tons of. It almost subconsciously sets you up with a feeling of unease while coming in for a bite because you're so used to walking into an old worn out building with weathered floors and warm woods, instead finding stainless steel and polished concrete. They do make a good attempt of incorporating NOLA into their decor though by having dozens of signs and works from local artist Simon Hardeveld strewn about the space. \n\nWe had breakfast downstairs in the counter service area and it was great. I ordered a simple two eggs, bacon toast and other staples style plate and everything came out quick and good. A plus of the downstairs seating is much of it sits you looking out to the street for great people watching. Lunch, another visit, was upstairs in the table service seating. Their main attraction is the wide range of burgers on their menu. They offer multiple meats beyond beef, including wild game and plenty of topping options to make your burger your own. The regular beef burger I ordered was good enough, but for a place that focuses on burgers burgers burgers, I wasn't blown away. \n\nService upstairs was great. Our server was very friendly, chatted us up and made sure our food came out as quickly as possible. \n\nAll in all, I liked it better for breakfast downstairs than the table service burger house upstairs.

Most of the time we get either sushi or the baked chicken dinner which for 6 bucks gets you a chicken breast and leg, plus two sides and a dinner roll! Today we opted out of the sushi and went for the chicken as you can see by my before and after pics.

My husband doesn't understand why I don't have a primary care doctor, but I tried once and the three I called weren't taking new patients! I was experiencing flu like symptoms so my OBGYN told me to go get swabbed for the flu. Luckily while looking online to see the closest minute clinic I noticed I could also put myself in line remote. DO THIS. There was a forty-minute wait time, but when I got there I waited ten minutes! I'm assuming both myself and the man in front of my put ourselves on remote waiting whereas the woman sitting there did not. Both of us came around the same time so I saw our names on the board go from not arrived to present. He was taken immediately and I just had to wait for him to be done. The woman who was sitting there who was marked present the whole time had to wait for both of us. Don't be that woman, be like us instead and take advantage of remote wait.\n\nThe nurse practitioner did all the normal vital sign checking and after swabbing me determined that I did indeed have the flu. She asked if I had difficulty reaching my OBGYN earlier in the day since I'd have to call back to let them know the diagnosis and when I said yes, she actually picked up the phone to call them for me! (Turns out the office was closed for lunch, of course they were). She had my prescription filled right at the pharmacy so I wouldn't have to go anywhere else. She seemed pretty worried about my wellbeing because she kept asking if I was ok to drive. (I must have looked really bad). In the end she sent me to the ER because she was worried about my high temp and high heartbeat (I was 16 months pregnant at the time). She called ahead to the ER so they would expect me. \n\nI'm actually really glad she was so worried about me driving because it scared me enough to call my husband to pick me up.

First attempt was slightly after 9PM on a Friday or Saturday to find they closed at 9.  Seriously, a restaurant that closes at 9 on a weekend is weak.  I know this is Florida, but not everyone is into the early bird special.  And this play is trying to be hip, kind of new-wave sushi, yet they close basically at sunset?  Weird.\n\nSecond time around was better.  First thing you notice about Kelp is how small it is.  I think there are 6-10 tables, and the place gets busy.  There were one or two tables when we arrived, but it filled up.  They also did a tremendous amount of to-go orders.  Point being, if you want a table, it might be a crap shoot.  \n\nWe ordered 3 rolls and my girlfriend got crab rangoons.  Can't tell you about the rangoons, but the rolls were very good.  Like I said, a lot of them are far from your tradition sushi rolls - even in the specialty roll concept, they were a bit far out.  For example, we got the Desert Oasis roll, which has mango and a thai chili sauce.  Sounds strange, right?  I thought I wouldn't like it, but it was actually my favorite.  We also got a Underwater Lake roll, which has boiled shrimp, cucumber, avocado and krab salad - also very good, but again, not very traditional.  Finally, we got a Salt Cove roll, which was spicy shrimp, smoked salmon with jalapeno.  This one I didn't care for, and I've had sushi with jalapeno before and really liked it, but in my opinion, the flavors didn't really go well together here.\n\nSo really, I'm deducting a bit for that last roll, but the others were very good.  And to Kelp's credit, they go light on the rice, heavy on the fish.  Drawbacks to Kelp, besides the size, are the options and prices.  They don't have a very extensive menu - 23 rolls (I think) and some appetizers.  Seems like a lot, but that's maybe 1/2 a sushi menu at other places.  Additionally, they are mostly specialty rolls.  They do not have too many of your regular run-of-the-mill rolls.  Finally, price wise, most of the rolls are over $10.  So if you're looking for your regular $6-$8 sushi rolls, this isn't for you.

It was easy to make the order, but no where to specify instructions or allergens.

We were able to pop in and pick up the food pretty much contactless. As for the food the beef Dan burri was great and would recommend it. The seaweed salad and ginger salad were a hard pass for me. The seaweed salad had a strange taste and the dressing for the ginger salad was kind of odd. It did not have a strong flavor, it didn't coat the lettuce at all. We ordered 2 sashimi platters, online it says 5 items come in it, however there was way more than 5 types of fish/seafood in ours. Some of the items were unidentifiable and the Krab (imitation crab) usually contains gluten so it would have been nice to be able to add a note to omit that item. Anyway, both my husband and I got sick after eating that food and we weren't sure if it was the sashimi platter or the seaweed salad. asomething just was \"fishy\" and we had what I would describe as food poisoning. We probably won't return because of this and the fact that there are so many sushi joints in Tampa, ones with really fresh fish.

However this place went 0-3 on all three dishes. \nThe positives. The location and the view. Not the best view from a Dunedin eatery but very good nonetheless. They have several tables to sit at and quite a few seats on the inside railing with counters. The two waitresses were excellent today. Never had to wait for a thing. They were on point. If one of us was out of water and the other waitress saw that she would immediately bring a new cup. They are perhaps the best waitress team of all time also the reason to add a star. Other positives are the extensive beer offerings and the prices of 4-5 for each one. \nThe food I most likely would not go back for:\nA special of Parmesan crab and shrimp dip was available. It was like warm. It did not taste very appealing and there were textures of coagulation like it was microwaved and cooked in certain areas. There was a decent amount of crab but only one piece of shrimp that we found. \nThe cod tacos were also not very good. The fish tasted fresh and cooked properly. However the slaw was undressed raw cabbage and at the bottom of the taco was a large amount of straight lime juice. And not the sweet kind. Some type of cream would have brought this from a 2-4. \nFinally the 14 dollar blackened scallop wrap. Not edible in any way. There was no texture or carmelization on the scallops. The blackening was just a spicy mixture that mixed with some liquid and just poured out of the wrap. We took most of this home and hopefully I can try and save the scallops and get some of the 14 bucks worth. There is nothing worse than blackening season that was not cooked and BLACKENED. Blackened means to blacken the seasonings to char them if you will. It does not mean to just have a spicy seasoning on it. That is called seasoned. \nI would probably go back to enjoy the view a beer and the great service but the food is off limits for us.", "date": "2016-06-22 19:01:52"}, {"_key": "1178144", "_id": "reviews/1178144", "_rev": "_fNyr4oO--Z", "review_id": "DF-3T1Um8_MQxoIDbIqYJA", "user_id": "KFiz7nL-lRFF-xIgOPZLkg", "business_id": "IR46YDkF358WDZuqZ4M2mQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "In a small city with so many good places to eat you need to really stand out from the rest and Olde Bay does.

Olde Bay Cafe was the perfect spot to have a beer and some appetizers with my parents on my first day in FL!\n\nThe restaurant is literally in the Dunedin harbor.  The main area for seating is out on the deck, which is great on a beautiful day!  We had an awesome view of the boats on the harbor for the sunset.\n\nWe chose local beers- I loved the one my mom picked, a beach blonde ale by three sisters.  Dad got a Belgian brew and I chose a darker seasonal ale, with some great spices! I loved their local beer selection and specials, it paired well with the seafood appetizers we ordered!\n\nThe menu looked great and they had mostly fresh catch options.  We chose the fish spread (the waiter said it was local smoked mullet) and the ceviche (which was made with local scallops).\n\nBoth came in a small basket with packaged ritz crackers.  The smoked mullet dip was AMAZING.  It was fresh and flavorful and not too \"fishy\"! The ceviche was also an excellent choice.  The scallops were small but fresh and delicious and mixed with some vegetables like celery and tomatoes. I would recommend both as appetizers!\n\nEven though the plastic almost flew into the harbor several times, the ritz crackers were actually a good pairing.  The buttery flaky taste actually complimented the dips perfectly!\n\nPerfect happy hour spot in Dunedin!", "date": "2013-12-24 02:40:35"}, {"_key": "1011689", "_id": "reviews/1011689", "_rev": "_fNyryh---C", "review_id": "UgPhv-Vx0dwoyXTfmWhQhQ", "user_id": "wfi0T-xq_P5sKQvwQitlYg", "business_id": "w9yOn6SCa9i7z59n5oLEDw", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I love this newly renovated coffee shop!

Their food is consistently better than any other similar place I've tried in the STL area.\n3. I really respect the amount of business they do.  Yes, that's also my #1 reason but the fact is that if you go in for lunch and spend maybe 30-minutes in the place you'll probably see them push out 50+ meals in that time with an unknown number going out for delivery as well.

You are lessening our carbon footprint, cheaper than the other food delivery services, and my Sushi came cold with a modified way of tracking my order. They will notify you when your order is received by the restaurant, when it is ready, when your pedaler is there for pick up, and when it is in route. I wish it was more accurate like Uber, but it gets the job done. \n\nHonestly, if you live in the Loop, CWE, Midtown, Downtown, and even Clayton. Use Food Pedalers to delivery your food on bikes. I honestly don't know how they would do it with very very large orders, but they have group catering online. \n\nThe only thing I would note is they have some great restaurants in their porfolio, but not everything yet. \n\nLoop:\nUnited Provisions, Pi, Three Kings, Rannoush and some others that don't deliver\n\nClayton is on break for the summer. This seems weird to me, but I'm sure it's because they are working on increasing their market share.\n\nThings to be wary of: The app sometimes is a little off. I tried to pre-order even in a close window and it often boots me out. In addition, the menu online is not the same menu for the same restaurants often. It's more limited.\n\nAnyways - glad to have this local service around for around $3.99 a delivery and you can tip your pedaler if you want online.", "date": "2017-07-11 01:13:16"}, {"_key": "1024596", "_id": "reviews/1024596", "_rev": "_fNyry8W--R", "review_id": "ohTi9Qqo4dVCCKU3UZJa5g", "user_id": "I4cfBoRWEhB90HBdjh8z5Q", "business_id": "--_lZuj_WCGnDG6n0emlRg", "stars": 3, "useful": 1, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "text": "The selection is so sparse, I'd swear this place has an echo.
