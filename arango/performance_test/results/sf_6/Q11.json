The cheesesteak had been flown in that same morning. Thank you, Tom.\n\nFor those who don't know, Pat's and Geno's are the most popular places to get a cheesesteak sandwich in Philadelphia. They are old and they are competitors. \"Pat's King of Steaks\" is the \"inventor and originator of the cheesesteak sandwich.\" They've been in business since 1930. During one of my visits to Philadelphia, friends and locals steered me away from Pat's and Geno's, both of which are popular with tourists. Instead, I went to Jim's Steaks South Street: https://www.yelp.com/biz/jims-south-st-philadelphia.\n\nIt would not be fair to make a comparison of my experiences with Pat's and Jim's since I had to reheat Pat's cheesesteak at home while I had Jim's cheesesteaks fresh at the restaurant.\n\nYou can purchase Pat's cheesesteaks by mail-order through Goldbelly: https://www.goldbelly.com/pats-king-of-steaks. The cheesesteaks were shipped frozen with dry ice packs and reheating instructions. The cheesesteaks were already assembled and wrapped in Pat's signature logo'd white paper wrappers. The Cheez Whiz was packed in separate containers. At the time of writing this review, Goldbelly offered Pat's Original Philly Cheesesteaks in sets of four ($79 or $19.75 per sandwich), eight ($129 or $16.13 per sandwich), and 12 ($169 or $14.08 per sandwich). Shipping was included in the quoted prices.\n\nReheating was quick and easy. Instructions were to bake at 300 degrees for 10-14 minutes until the bread was lightly-crisped and the meat heated through. The Cheez Whiz could be reheated in the microwave or in a saucepan. I reheated the sandwich in my old toaster oven so it took a little longer than 14 minutes. I used the microwave to melt the Cheez Whiz.\n\nI was impressed with how the sandwich turned out. It looked just like the cheesesteaks I saw of Pat's online. I had the \"Wit\" onions and Whiz version, but you can get \"Wit-Out\" onions and change the cheese to Provolone or American if you want. I think I may have baked the sandwich a little too long because the outside of the hoagie roll started to crack and it was extra crispy. That was okay, though, because the inside was warm, soft, and delectably chewy. The bread was good. There were plenty of tender morsels of quality ribeye, but what brought everything together was the melted Cheez Whiz. Mmm... That melted cheese coated the steak and eventually found its way to the bottom of the sandwich, soaking into the bread. This made each bite rich, flavorful, and really satisfying.\n\nThere aren't many ingredients - bread, meat, onion, cheese. Pat's found the right combination of quality, taste, and texture. If you're considering purchasing some of Pat's cheesesteaks via mail order, let this review be a vote of confidence. At the time of writing this, you can only get the Original Philly Cheesesteak via Goldbelly. The Mushroom Steak, Pepper Steak, Mushroom Pepper Steak, Pizza Steak, Fish Cake, Hot Dog, and Fries are not available online.\n\nEnjoy.", "date": "2021-08-11 14:51:55"}, {"_key": "10211286", "_id": "reviews/10211286", "_rev": "_fNzD84m--N", "review_id": "fds_MU3AdAIGb0SsUI0K6g", "user_id": "j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "business_id": "XScJI9exHgC0u_c3vmm1vQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 5, "text": "On Friday, we moseyed on down to the roulette table and placed a split bet on 28 and 29.  17-to-1 payout on a split bet, 19-to-1 odds of winning.

Yes, I love Rocky that much. The movies are entertaining, nostalgic, and inspirational and the music, especially the songs by Bill Conti, are iconic and some of the absolute best in cinematic history (and in all of music, in my opinion).\n\nThe Rocky Steps are located in front of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. There are 72 steps and they are very, very wide. Even if you're not a fan of Rocky, you owe it to yourself to visit the steps and climb to the top to take in the amazing views of Philadelphia. At the top of the steps, facing southeast, you can look down Philly's famous Benjamin Franklin Parkway (https://www.yelp.com/biz/ben-franklin-parkway-philadelphia). It includes historic circles, fountains, statues, and buildings such as Logan Circle (https://www.yelp.com/biz/logan-circle-philadelphia-2), Swann Memorial Fountain (https://www.yelp.com/biz/swann-memorial-fountain-philadelphia-2), and City Hall (https://www.yelp.com/biz/city-hall-philadelphia). The views of the Philly skyline are amazing and picturesque.\n\nAt the top of the center of the steps, on the ground, are foot markers for Rocky. You can stand where he stood to recreate his legendary victory poses with fists raised in the air. In addition to pictures at the top of the steps, you'll probably see people run up the steps just like Rocky did in his training montages: https://youtu.be/ABg0c_E7OOI. I did both and had a blast doing it. I want to go back and do it again. Haha.\n\nThere were Rocky lookalikes hanging out around the statue and steps. I happened to run into two that I know and met years ago at Dragon Con in Atlanta: @lonstermash and @thelordhumungus (on Instagram). What a small world. At the top of the steps, a man from South Africa (a solo traveler who told me his name was Kennedy), asked if I could help take some photos and videos of him running up the steps and raising his arms in victory.

For whatever reason, my dad loved them. We were a Mercedes and Subaru family in the 80s and 90s (the 2000s and 2010s were a different story). Due to nostalgia, Subaru will always hold a special place in my heart.\n\nMy first car was a white 1986 Subaru GL wagon. It was roughly 80-85 horsepower and used a carburetor. We bought the car used from the Hanes family of Hanesbrands in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. If I recall correctly, the car was Mrs. Hanes' winter/mountain car. Like most Subarus, the car was all-wheel drive (AWD). It could switch between 2WD and AWD instantly at the press of a button on the gear-shifter. We used it whenever it would snow (we lived in NC).\n\nIn all honestly, the car was cheap and a POS -- perfect for a high schooler like me at the time. When I was in high school, I got into three accidents in the car, two of which were my fault: (1) I spun out of control on a wet curve and jumped a curb (luckily, no other vehicles were involved), (2) I hit a Greensboro police officer while trying to make a left turn into a parking lot (a big pickup truck stopped to let me go and I didn't see the oncoming cop coming in the next lane over), and (3) someone rear-ended me near Hanes Mall. We got the car fixed up good as \"new\" every time.\n\nA couple unique things about the car were (1) the spare tire was stored under the hood up front with the engine and (2) I could make the car backfire on demand. One time, I blew up the catalytic converter and muffler while trying to make the car do a huge backfire (all I had to do was get the RPMs up really high and then completely let go of the gas... BOOM!). It created a loud explosion. An innocent bystander described the sound like a shotgun blast. With a blown-out muffler, my little old wagon sounded like a muscle car.\n\nI don't think the car had any airbags nor did it have anti-lock brakes, though I could be wrong. Also, the doors were incredibly light and flimsy. If I had ever been T-boned in that car, I definitely would have gotten seriously injured, if not, killed. Needless to say, I didn't feel very safe driving the car.\n\nWhen I left North Carolina, I ended up taking the car with me to Georgia (Atlanta). In hindsight, I'm surprised the car made the 300+ mile trip. As soon as I arrived in Atlanta, the car developed transmission issues and lost its ability to reverse. We got it fixed, but that was effectively the end of my time the car. We sold it to a student in the NC mountains I estimate no more than one or two years after that.\n\nAlong with not being able to reverse, another memory I have of the car in Atlanta was trying to make it up a hill, from a stop, on to the interstate. The car was so weak that I frequently floored it and the engine would putter like a go-kart. It barely made it up the hill from Clairmont Road onto I-85 south. I associate that stretch of road with my struggling Subaru and will never forget it.\n\nOther Subarus I drove were a gold 1990 (I think that was the year) Legacy wagon and a green 1998 Outback wagon. The Legacy was primarily driven by my aunt. I wasn't a fan of it, but it got the job done. The 1998 Outback wagon was my sister's and it was nice. It had a CD player and looked like a beefed-up wagon, approaching crossover territory. The Outbacks were sporty and trended towards the look and function of an SUV. My other sister had a mid-to-late 1980s Subaru wagon like mine as well. She drove it a lot between High Point and Raleigh (over 90 miles one way).\n\nMy cousins had Subarus too -- sedans. One of the sedans had a digital green speedometer which I though was cool. Another one of the sedans was a lemon and we returned it. It was a used sedan that kept having problems. One problem I remember was with the A/C. When one mechanic put the car on a lift and looked at the underside, it was revealed to us that the sedan was actually two different cars that were pieced/welded together. This was never disclosed to us by the seller, hence the return.\n\nIn the early 2000s, I really wanted a Forester or WRX. I guess you could say I was blindly loyal to Subaru. However, my parents gifted me a 2001.5 Volkswagen Passat which I have meticulously maintained and still drive to this day. Thanks for the good times, Subaru.

There are less UberXLs on the road compared to regular Ubers, but they were still pretty prompt in picking us up. We never had to wait long.\n\nAll of our rides were good except for one. We requested an UberXL. A driver showed up in a vehicle with enough seating. However, he was rude to us at the outset. When we opened the door to his car, he immediately leaned towards the open door, stuck his hand out, and adamantly told us to stop. He said he could only carry 6 people. Well that's how many we had. As he pulled his car up to us, I wonder if he miscounted or panicked when he saw our group on the sidewalk. When we told him we had 6 people, he let us into his car. He could have handled the situation better and been more polite.\n\nThe back seats of his car were uncomfortable. There was barely any legroom. All of the other UberXLs that we rode in were comfortable and had adequate legroom. I don't think this guy should have classified his vehicle as an UberXL even though his car technically had room for 6 passengers. Perhaps Uber should institute a legroom requirement for UberXL vehicles (if one doesn't exist already).\n\nAside from that one driver/vehicle, the rest of our Uber experiences in Nashville were fine. The other drivers were friendly.", "date": "2018-10-14 15:14:26"}, {"_key": "10734776", "_id": "reviews/10734776", "_rev": "_fNzEcIa--M", "review_id": "HEihXzftWivwb7A16KhqAQ", "user_id": "j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "business_id": "V7dXBEowSa53mOVaDtnj_A", "stars": 4, "useful": 6, "funny": 0, "cool": 3, "text": "Topgolf is great. I'm a big fan of the two locations where I live in Atlanta. So far, in my experience, all of the locations have been the same. They're pretty much carbon copies of each other. However, I believe Topgolf in Nashville is different than the other locations because it has a 600-person-capacity concert and event venue, called The Cowan, attached. This is the Music City after all.\n\nThis Topgolf is relatively new. It opened just a year ago, in September 2017, immediately north of downtown Nashville, next to the Cumberland River. The facility looks great with over 100 covered hitting bays, each with its own TV and seating. Some of the seats are lounge-style couches while others are more like a bar with high boys and tall chairs. This place offers more than just golf -- they have a full-service restaurant, multiple bars, and a rooftop terrace. Due to its size with multiple levels and private event spaces, Topgolf is great for parties. I've been to a Yelp event and a company party at Topgolf and had a blast.\n\nYou don't have to play golf to have fun here. It's a lot like going to a regular bar or sports bar, except this one is integrated with a cool-looking driving range.\n\nIf you've never been to Topgolf before, the concept is simple. This is more than just a driving range. It's similar to a bowling alley. Just like renting a lane at a bowling alley, you rent a hitting bay at Topgolf. Each bay can accommodate up to six players. Each player must purchase a Topgolf membership ($5). A membership to Topgolf is a one-time fee and your membership works at almost any Topgolf location. Prices per bay vary by time of day. The earlier you go, the less it costs.\n\nHere are Topgolf Nashville's prices at the time of writing this review:\n\nOpen to 12pm: $25 per bay per hour\n12pm to 5pm: $35 per bay per hour\n5pm to close: $45 per bay per hour\n\nYou are charged per bay not per person, so the more people you have per bay (up to six people per bay), the less it costs per person. Conversely, the more people you have, the less balls each person hits. You can hit as many balls as you want per hour (unlimited).\n\nWe showed up around 12:40pm on a Friday and the place was already full. We had to wait about 15 minutes for a bay. We waited and ordered drinks at the main bar during that time. There are three levels. We were assigned to a hitting bay on the main (second) level. The first level is ground level. Levels two and three are elevated with, in my opinion, better views.\n\nAll the Topgolfs I've been to have nice views. The range looks neat because the targets are multicolored and each looks like a bullseye with several layers. Every golf ball at Topgolf has a microchip inside so that each ball can be tracked. This is how the system keeps track of your yardages and scores. Your scores and stats are recorded and saved to your membership which you can access online or via Topgolf's mobile app. Pretty handy.\n\nThere are many different types of golf games you can play. There's a touchscreen device at each hitting bay which allows you to pick a game and keep track of scoring. Scores are displayed both on the touchscreen and on a bigger screen for everyone sitting in the bay to see. There's a game for everyone, no matter the skill level. I think they're a lot of fun. Some games have you aim at certain targets while others have you focus on chipping or hitting long drives. The more accurate you are (the closer you hit your ball to the center of the target/right at the flag), the more points you get. You can also earn point bonuses and multipliers based on a variety of factors (type of game, consecutive hits, round number, etc.).\n\nEach bay comes with its own set of men's and women's clubs. They're included with your bay rental. Each set for both men and women include a driver, 3-wood, 3-hybrid, 4-iron, 6-iron, 8-iron, and pitching wedge. Not a complete set, but good enough. There are also bag stands if you want to bring your own clubs. I've taken my own clubs before, but I don't really recommend it unless you're in a competition or really want to play with your own clubs. For casual fun, Topgolf's clubs are fine. I do suggest bringing a golf glove if you have one.\n\nI don't recommend using Topgolf as a driving range to improve your golf game. Go to a standard driving range with real grass for that. It's cheaper.\n\nService was great. We ordered drinks, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. They served rounds of canned Miller Lite beer in buckets of ice. I forget our server's name (a petite brunette with curly hair), but she was terrific; very kind and attentive.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun activity to do in Nashville, Topgolf fits the bill.", "date": "2018-09-28 13:55:02"}, {"_key": "10763771", "_id": "reviews/10763771", "_rev": "_fNzEdHa--T", "review_id": "K0nLgWeVRhN8rsDZlQtSYQ", "user_id": "j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "business_id": "FQ_QUyrwtnaEdxUxruZkXg", "stars": 5, "useful": 5, "funny": 3, "cool": 6, "text": "I'm giving Minibooths five stars mainly for the following three reasons:\n\n1.

I love sharing photos on social media and I appreciate how comprehensive Minibooths is in providing their customers/guests images in different formats.\n\nAs far as the photo booth experience itself, it's pretty much the same as photo booths by other companies. Minibooths had all the typical props such as funny headwear and goofy glasses. There was nothing too memorable or out of the ordinary. I remember masks for Captain America and Iron Man, Thor's hammer, a colorful plush hot dog, and a cartoony shark hat that looks like the shark is eating you when you put it on. The backdrop was physical as opposed to digital (green screen).\n\nFour photos were taken per session/strip. The photo booth had an attendant and everything was controlled by the attendant (so no push-button-start, remote control, or anything like that). There were no options to enter our email address or phone number to receive pictures. We had to rely on the bride, who booked Minibooths, to provide us with a link and password to access the photo booth gallery on Minibooths's SmugMug site.

What was most impressive about this place, for a wedding venue, was where cocktail hour took place: on the \"Out on a Limb\" tree canopy walk 50 feet above the ground. How cool is that, to have drinks and hors d'oeuvres up in a tree canopy?\n\nThe setting was beautiful, especially at sunset, and it was unique. However, it wasn't perfect. The elevated walkways and standing areas were made of metal grates, so women couldn't wear stiletto heels. If you dropped a small object or something as thin as a phone (even with a protective case around it), the openings were big enough for you to lose them for good. Also, there was a bottleneck to the main platform. This caused problems when servers tried to pass around hors d'oeuvres. They sometimes couldn't make it past the narrow bridge to the main platform before running out of food. Finally, waste containers were few and far between. This caused used skewers, napkins, and cups to pile up on white tablecloth cocktail tables and that's not what those tables were meant for. Criticisms aside, I do think Out on a Limb was a really neat, memorable, and one-of-a-kind cocktail hour experience.\n\nThe wedding ceremony took place outdoors on the lawn in front of the arboretum's visitor center and shop. The lawn was on top of a small hill that had a nice view of the open blue sky. The weather was a little warm/hot, but otherwise sunny and perfect on this particular day. It was breezy during the ceremony. You could see it and hear it in the trees surrounding the lawn, and it was also picked up by the microphones. We sat near the front and could hear the couple recite their vows, but I'm pretty sure it was difficult for those sitting in the middle and back to hear. I'm guessing that's probably on the DJ and his equipment; just something to keep in mind if you're thinking about having a ceremony on the lawn.\n\nFrom arrival before the ceremony through the reception, guests had access to the visitor center and shop, mainly to use restrooms. The visitor center has two floors and there are restrooms on both.\n\nThe time period before the ceremony was when we and other guests explored the arboretum. It normally costs $20 per adult to enter. I'm not a big nature/outdoors guy, so admittedly, I don't appreciate these kinds of places as much as others, like my fiancee (who once worked at a botanical garden), do. For those who don't know (I didn't), an arboretum is a botanical garden that generally showcases trees and other \"woody plants\" like shrubs and climbing plants like vines. We visited some gorgeous exhibits like the giant, whimsical willow sculptures (after searching online, I believe this exhibit may have been called \"A Waltz in the Woods\" by Patrick Dougherty) and the stately, ornate Rose Garden. We happened to catch both the bride and groom taking photos in both areas, so we must have stumbled upon two of the more picturesque places at the arboretum.\n\nI recommend checking out Out on a Limb, A Waltz in the Woods, and the Rose Garden if you visit. They're all worth the time.\n\nThe reception mostly took place outside, around the back of the visitor center, in a covered patio space. There were about 150 guests. With the DJ, dance floor, and round tables, the space was fully utilized. It was a snug, but not uncomfortable, fit. Catering for cocktail hour and the reception was provided by Company's Coming Catering, one of the arboretum's five approved caterers. You can read my review of the catering company here: https://www.yelp.com/biz/companys-coming-catering-philadelphia-2. Both my fiancee and I, who are in the final stages of wedding planning ourselves, were impressed with Company's Coming, from the food to the service. The lower level space of the visitor center's interior was used for a wedding guestbook, gift/card reception box, bar, photo booth, and cake display/cutting.\n\nAll in all, we had a great time at the Morris Arboretum. I really enjoyed it. My fiancee said she \"loved it\" and considered this place a \"hidden gem\" (granted, we're not from the area, but this place had that kind of feel to her).", "date": "2019-11-03 13:03:17"}, {"_key": "10859640", "_id": "reviews/10859640", "_rev": "_fNzEgzy--A", "review_id": "ZOY7_7qX0O49p9rfCwoq9Q", "user_id": "j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "business_id": "s_KDMAhH9B8NBaxIC5FZ4A", "stars": 4, "useful": 10, "funny": 2, "cool": 7, "text": "Benjamin Franklin's Burial Place is located within the Christ Church Burial Grounds (https://www.yelp.com/biz/christ-church-burial-ground-philadelphia-2).

He has a special fenced-in area that faces the sidewalk, street, and appropriately, the United States Mint, at the corner of Arch and N Independence Mall E.\n\nWe visited Benjamin Franklin's last resting place on a Sunday around 5:30pm. There was hardly anyone around. His grave consisted of a large, engraved marble slab with a bunch of coins - mostly pennies - tossed on top. The reason why is because Franklin (1706-1790) popularized the phrase: \"A penny saved is a penny earned.\" Also, the \"Franklin cent,\" the first official circulation coin of the US, was designed by Franklin and minted in 1787 (worth $0.01). On either side of the fence protecting the gravesite were brick walls and columns with honorary and informational plaques. One plaque included quotes about Franklin from George Washington, French Revolution leader Honore Gabriel Riqueti (Count of Mirabeau), and French statesman Jacques Turgot.\n\nFranklin's wife Deborah Read is buried with him. His son, Francis Folger, and four other signers of the Declaration of Independence are buried nearby.\n\nIf you're visiting the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall, you might as well swing by and visit Benjamin Franklin's Grave.

One of the more memorable barbecue experiences I've had.\n\nMartin's Bar-B-Que Joint has existed in the Nashville area since October 2006 with the opening of the company's first location in Nolensville, south of town. This location, in downtown Nashville, is relatively new. It opened in August 2016. At the time of writing this review, there are a total of five locations in and around Nashville and two in Louisville, Kentucky. Like Hattie B's, I hope Martin's opens a location where I live in Atlanta.\n\nThis downtown location is huge. It's probably the biggest barbecue restaurant I've been to. It's two stories with ample seating. This is a fast-casual restaurant where you stand in line, order and pay upfront, take a seat, and your food is brought to you. The first level contains a bar with 30 taps, a spacious dining room, and a covered and enclosed patio. It's all indoors. The second level is impressive. It's a large, indoor-outdoor space that contains two more bars (another one with 30 taps), an array of seating, a beer garden with a stage for live music, and games like table shuffleboard, table tennis, and darts (four boards). The decor upstairs is kitschy. One of the bars is decorated with pages and covers from professional wrestling magazines while one of the \"rooms\" consists of seating entirely from old automobiles. The seating upstairs is more communal with long picnic tables and high-tops. Overall, the atmosphere is relaxed and fun. It's one of the best things about this place.\n\nThis place is popular. We showed up on a Saturday shortly after opening (11am) and there was a small line. By the time we left, close to 1pm (we stuck around and played darts), there was a line down the sidewalk. The restaurant does not have dedicated parking. We parked in a nearby pay lot at the corner of 4th Ave S and Peabody St.\n\nMartin's is known for West-Tennessee-style whole hog barbecue. They have four whole hog pits on-site. They don't freeze or microwave anything. Everything is cooked fresh daily.\n\nLike other barbecue joints, you can get your barbecue served in a sandwich ($7.49-13.48 with or without a side) or on a tray ($11.99-17.99 with two sides). Meats include pulled whole hog, pulled pork shoulder, sliced beef brisket, sliced smoked turkey, bologna (sandwich only), smoked sausage, and chicken. There are also smoked wings (six for $7.99 up to 18 for $22.49) and ribs, both spares and smaller \"babies\" ($12.99 for four bones and two sides up to $25.99 for 12 bones and three sides).\n\nThere are apps like deviled eggs ($4.99) and catfish fingers ($7.99); salads and baked potatoes ($4.99-11.99); burgers and other sandwiches like a patty melt and pimento cheese club ($7.49-13.48 with or without a side); tacos, chicken tenders, and more ($12.99-14.99 with two sides). Desserts include items like pecan pie, strawberry cake (Saturday only), and Southern fried pie ($4.49-4.99). There's a kids menu, takeout-only family suppers (feeding anywhere from 2-12; $35.99-109.99), and sampler combos (feeding 1-7; $20.99-94.99).\n\nMartin's has five barbecue sauces: (1) Jack's Creek - their signature sauce, (2) Sweet Dixie, (3) Alabama White, (4) Palmetto Gold - mustard-based, and (5) Devil's Nectar - spicy. Their menu has recommendations on what sauces go best with which meats.\n\nSix of us shared the following for lunch:\n\n* Big Poppa Sampler (feeds 6-7) ($94.99) - full rack ribs, 12 oz. pork, 12 oz. brisket, 1/2 chicken, and 3 pints of sides (we chose green beans, mac & cheese, and fresh-cut French fries)\n* Six wings ($7.99) - tossed in Memphis dry rub\n* Two orders of hush puppies - one order consists of four hushpuppies for $2.99\n* Two cornbread hoecakes ($2.99 each)\n* Drinks: assorted beer, bottles of Cheerwine, and water with nugget ice\n\nWe finished everything. I thought the meal was outstanding with eye-popping presentation.\n\nI have to say the ribs were superb and probably my favorite meat followed by the wings. The ribs were covered in a generous amount of seasoning. They were meaty and delectable with great flavor and an appetizing consistency. The wings were terrific - crispy on the outside, moist on the inside. Very tasty. The brisket was my third-favorite. Thick-cut slices of beef with just the right amount of leanness and fattiness to each piece. The charred outer edges were wonderful as well. As for the chicken, it was a standout too. I had a thigh and was impressed with how flavorful and juicy the chicken was. Top notch. The skin had fantastic smoky flavor. The pork was good, pulled into tender and yummy strands.\n\nAmong the sides, my favorite, surprisingly, was the green beans. They were fresh, soft, cooked with onions and pork, and tasted excellent. The hush puppies were very good. They had a nice crunch and were warm and comforting. Both the mac & cheese and the fries were appetizingly addictive. The cornbread hoecakes were fine.

It's in the heart of Nashville's country music scene and situated in a prime location. The apartments are within walking distance to a lot of attractions and they're conveniently located just off the highway: I-40 exits 209A and 209B - Demonbreun Street. We walked to many restaurants and bars during our time here.\n\nElement Music Row is a modern luxury apartment high-rise. The building is 19 stories tall and contains 431 apartments. On our first night, we grilled out on the patio next to the pool. The patio, along with the adjacent club room, had terrific views of the Nashville cityscape. The city views were definitely one of my favorite things about this place. There was a sink next to our grill which I thought was nice. The pool was a saltwater pool with cabana-style seating areas. It felt like a stylish resort.\n\nWe spent quite a bit of time in the club room. There, we played cards, shot pool, drank, and watched sports on TV. The club room, along with the rest of the property, was very modern and chic. I loved the clean and contemporary look of the building's interior. Whoever designed and decorated this place did a fantastic job. For such a modern apartment though, I thought it was funny they had a \"Cyber Cafe\" next to the club room.\n\nThe lobby was super bright and appeared to have a 24/7 concierge. The lobby had some comfortable seating areas and free Starbucks coffee. The self-serve, single-serve coffee machine had three roasts to choose from. The elevators had sleek displays playing the news and showing current date, time, and local weather information. As guests, we were able to park in Element Music Row's parking garage for free, but we needed to renew our parking pass (arranged for by our friend who is a resident) every 24 hours, if I recall correctly.\n\nWe paid $750 for three nights in our one-bedroom guest apartment ($250 per night). This wasn't a bad deal because this cost was split among multiple people. Three of us slept comfortably in the apartment: one in the bedroom, one on the pull-out sofa, and one in the walk-in closet on an air mattress (we had to bring the air mattress). The apartment was clean and quite spacious. The walk-in closet was big enough to be its own room, complete with power outlets. The apartment was nicer than the average Airbnb and it was almost like staying at a hotel. There were clean sheets, pillowcases, towels, and even soap, shampoo, and conditioner for us. No housekeeping or room service though.\n\nOverall, I was pretty happy with the apartment and would stay here again.", "date": "2018-11-08 14:46:00"}, {"_key": "11296949", "_id": "reviews/11296949", "_rev": "_fNzE9r6--I", "review_id": "dgrlHhLdK0rKKapXU2DvOg", "user_id": "j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "business_id": "NfOnxD8NT4UQmSfBY6iqng", "stars": 3, "useful": 5, "funny": 2, "cool": 4, "text": "The George Jones is many things.

Event space\n\nThe George Jones is named after a famous country singer by the same name. He's regarded by many to be the greatest country singer of all time. I'd never heard of him until my friend, who lives in Nashville, brought a group of us here for drinks late on a Friday afternoon. (I'm not a fan of country music.)\n\nThis is an ambitious business with a lot to offer. It's relatively new, having opened in 2015. It's located in downtown Nashville just off Lower Broadway. The place is multistory and looks nice. It's fairly spacious and modern with a cool rooftop patio that overlooks the Cumberland River and East Bank, directly across from Nissan Stadium (where the Tennessee Titans play).\n\nThere's a lot going on when you first enter from the street. You'll find the gift shop which has assorted George Jones merchandise and souvenirs. There's a big stage, bar, TVs (including a wall of connected TVs that form a single giant display), a variety of seating (communal and private tables, high boys, booths, etc.), and retractable garage-style doors that open up towards the river. It's somewhat of a sensory overload initially.\n\nAside from barbecue, the restaurant serves breakfast and brunch, soups, salads, and sandwiches, tacos, apps and sides, and desserts. These guys are on OpenTable if you want to make a free reservation and earn points that can be used towards future discounts at other restaurants or an Amazon gift card. This place works well as a sports bar because of all the TVs.\n\nAdmission to the museum costs extra -- $17 per adult, less for others like seniors, students, AAA members, military, and youth. You can purchase admission to the museum at the gift shop.\n\nWe spent most of our time hanging out on the rooftop patio where there's a second stage and bar. We accessed the rooftop from the main floor via elevator. A large portion of the rooftop is uncovered though several of the tables are covered with umbrellas or canopies. The patio has great views of the river and downtown. The stage and bar portion of the rooftop are covered. It was really hot the day of our visit so the staff had multiple misting fans running which was nice. Shade from the umbrellas and canopies was much-need (and appreciated) too.\n\nService was fine.\n\nThere were bands playing on both stages, upstairs and downstairs, which was kind of neat.\n\nOverall, coming from someone who isn't much of a bar or country music person, I thought The George Jones was A-OK.", "date": "2018-10-09 14:04:14"}, {"_key": "11368182", "_id": "reviews/11368182", "_rev": "_fNzFAN6--O", "review_id": "J4bJ0rpLf5uv0tYUa9Ic7Q", "user_id": "j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "business_id": "OdYRrJsJnCFpMYc_PuWFdw", "stars": 4, "useful": 9, "funny": 4, "cool": 5, "text": "It doesn't take a Jack White fan to realize this place is pretty cool. This is the world headquarters of Third Man Records, Jack White's record label. I should preface this review by saying I am not a Jack White fan nor am I a huge fan of his genres of music, though I do like a couple of his songs: \"Seven Nation Army\" (2003) and \"Another Way to Die\" (2008). I came here because one of my buddies, who is a big Jack White fan, wanted to come here. He ended up buying some merchandise to take back home to Brooklyn.\n\nCurrently, there are two Third Man Records retail storefronts: this one in Nashville which opened in 2009 and one in Detroit which opened in 2015. This store is located in the SoBro (south of Broadway) neighborhood of downtown Nashville. There is no dedicated parking for customers, but there is plenty of free street parking on both 7th Ave S and Middleton St. We parked on Middleton. There were lots of spots available when we visited around 1:30pm on a Saturday. This isn't the nicest part of town, but we felt safe enough walking around the area in broad daylight.\n\nThe building looks cool. It looks like an old studio or warehouse that has been painted black/dark gray with bright solid yellow, red, and blue garage doors. The storefront looks like an album cover itself.\n\nThere's a lot going on at this location. It's a record store, \"novelties lounge,\" offices and distribution center, photo studio, and live music venue. My friends and I only spent time in the record store and novelties lounge. It was packed when we arrived because a bunch of people had gathered to take a tour. According to Third Man Records' website, the store offers tours on Fridays and Saturdays at 2pm for $20 per person (first come, first served) with a limit of 10 tickets sold per tour. There were definitely more than 10 people taking the tour we saw and it started around 1:30pm instead of 2pm.\n\nThe record store and novelties lounge aren't very big. It was quite crowded and snug with all the customers, but once the folks on the tour left, there was much more space for us to spread out and explore. Both the record store and the novelties lounge are eclectically and uniquely decorated. I'm not quite sure how to describe it other than to say it's a combination of retro and kitsch... perhaps?\n\nThe novelties lounge is neat. It opened in 2012. It's called the \"novelties lounge\" because it has a bunch of working vintage machinery that you can actually use. They include a Scopitone 16mm film jukebox, a classic \"fully automatic\" photo booth where you can do \"4 different poses\" in only \"2 minutes,\" a two-person listening booth with two turntables where you can preview records, and a really nifty 1947 Voice-O-Graph. For $20, you can use the Voice-O-Graph to record anything you want, up to about two minutes, on a 6-inch record.\n\nYou can hear what customers have recorded using the Voice-O-Graph on Third Man Records' website here: https://thirdmanrecords.com/locations/nashville-storefront/record-booth.\n\nAnother fun fact: Third Man Records is the only music venue in the world that records live performances directly to vinyl records.", "date": "2018-10-25 13:43:33"}, {"_key": "11414472", "_id": "reviews/11414472", "_rev": "_fNzFDrW--H", "review_id": "c7Bl18i-sCUntzSYczj2VA", "user_id": "j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "business_id": "fTQs7fBggnYlKGbujXw76w", "stars": 3, "useful": 9, "funny": 1, "cool": 5, "text": "Bertucci's is a Massachusetts-based brick oven pizza and pasta chain with numerous locations throughout the Northeast. You can find this one at Plymouth Meeting Mall in the northwest Philadelphia suburb of Plymouth Meeting. Bertucci's has an exterior storefront and patio on the north side of the mall near mall entrance #4.\n\nWe visited with a large group for Sunday lunch and I enjoyed it. The pizza and Coke hit the spot for me.\n\nThis is a spacious restaurant with an open kitchen and attentive staff. It's a great place for groups. There were over 20-30 in our group. We were seated in a separate, semi-private room off to the side. The fenced-in patio has several umbrella-covered tables. The open kitchen showcases the restaurant's brick oven. You can walk right up to it and the pizza and pasta prep counter. The lady that was doing the baking during our particular visit was friendly. It was fun watching the staff prepare ingredients and use the peels during the baking process.\n\nBertucci's offers about 10 different kinds of pizza with small sizes costing about $13-14 each and most large sizes about $22 each. You can also create your own pizza starting at similar prices. Their dough is made from scratch in house.\n\nI had multiple slices of both the classic Bertucci pizza and the popular Sporkie pizza. The Bertucci is made with extra pepperoni, housemade tomato sauce, and extra mozzarella. It was good. You get pepperoni in every bite which I liked. The Sporkie comes with sweet Italian sausage, ricotta, mozzarella, and housemade tomato sauce. I can't say I preferred one pizza over the other. They were equally tasty. I really enjoyed the smooth, creamy clumps of ricotta and the piquant, savory pieces of Italian sausage. The pizza and ingredients tasted freshly made. The pizza slices were soft and floppy with nicely charred outer crusts, so they had a hint of smoky/burnt flavor. I piled on the red pepper flakes and couldn't stop eating. I kept grabbing slice after slice.\n\nAlong with pizza, Bertucci's menu features an assortment of Italian cuisine including apps like bruschetta and burrata ($8.99) and pan-sauteed mussels ($13.99), soups and salads, calzones ($13.99), entrees such as chicken Parm ($18.99) and grilled shrimp risotto formaggi ($18.99), pasta, and desserts (cannoli, tiramisu, etc.).\n\nThe restaurant was clean and the interior felt up-to-date. It also felt formulaic and like a chain (which it is).\n\nIn the end, I thought this place was fine (A-OK).

That's a lot. It's easily one of the most-reviewed places I've visited. It's one of those popular \"public\" markets with a food hall and a bevy of vendors selling everything from fresh produce and flowers to handmade crafts and jewelry. A lot of big cities have them. Comparable markets include Chelsea Market in New York, the Ferry Building in San Francisco, and Pike Place Market in Seattle. In Atlanta, where I'm from, Reading Terminal Market (\"RTM\") reminds me most of Sweet Auburn Curb Market. New developments have popped up around the country in recent years that try to emulate a sort of old-school municipal market feel.\n\nRTM is different because, unlike its newer counterparts, its atmosphere is genuine and not manufactured. The market opened in 1893, making it one of the country's oldest. Some of the market's vendors have been around since the very beginning, over 100 years, like Bassetts Ice Cream. You can find them just inside one of the 12th Street entrances on the west side of the market. This is where we entered.\n\nThis is a Philadelphia hot spot and one of the most recommended places for out-of-towners to go. We visited over the weekend and the market was crowded with tourists and locals alike. It should definitely be high on any foodie's Philly to-do list. There are so many food stalls here and the selection is eclectic, from Amish-style rotisserie chicken, sourced regionally, from Dienner's Bar-B-Q Chicken to Peking duck from Sang Kee Peking Duck (an RTM outpost of a Philly Chinatown favorite).\n\nIn all, there are over 80 vendors packed onto one floor. They're classified into the following categories: bakeries, beverages, dairy & cheese; housewares, books, crafts, etc; meats & poultry, Pennsylvania Dutch (note the PA Dutch vendors are closed every Sunday), produce, restaurants, seafood, and specialty foods. The market is laid out in a grid with four large aisles going north-south, and 11 smaller aisles going east-west. There are a handful of communal seating areas (almost all seats were taken during our visit), restrooms (clean enough), and an attended welcome booth if you'd like to pick up a map and/or ask for recommendations. Some of the vendors also have their own dedicated seating.\n\nA few recommendations:\n\n1. Roast pork sandwich at Tommy DiNic's Pork & Beef. Perhaps the most popular vendor here. They offer wraparound counter service.\n\n2. Pretzel from Miller's Twist. These are fresh-made, Amish-style pretzels. They're also known for their cheddar-jalapeno pretzel dog and breakfast foods. (Note: Miller's Twist is a PA Dutch vendor and is closed on Sundays.)\n\n3. Scrapple from Down Home Diner. Also known as Pannhaas by the PA Dutch, this is basically pork scraps made into a savory pate. Reminds me of the Neese's liver pudding (livermush) I ate growing up in North Carolina.\n\nSurprisingly, there's not really a well-known or recommended vendor for cheesesteaks here though there are some who sell them (e.g. Carmen's Famous Italian Hoagies & Cheesesteaks). Bring cash because some vendors, like Carmen's, are cash-only. A couple places that caught our eye that we didn't get to try were Pearl's Oyster Bar and Mueller Chocolate Co. (featured on Food Network).\n\nThere are two parking garages, one at 12th and Filbert (Parkway Garage) and the other at 11th and Arch (Hilton Garage). Signs posted at each entrance to the market advertised 2-hour discount parking with $10 market purchase and validation at the vendor.\n\nIf you're pressed for time in Philly, Reading Terminal Market is a great place to visit since there are so many vendors all in one place. If you're from out of town, be sure to visit the northwest corner of the market where all the PA Dutch vendors are located. They're unique.", "date": "2019-08-27 14:01:35"}, {"_key": "11476967", "_id": "reviews/11476967", "_rev": "_fNzFGS6--_", "review_id": "qSPreXTXH1wK5m9ay30sKQ", "user_id": "j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "business_id": "PV_wY7R-eY8DFr-9BmoEyA", "stars": 3, "useful": 5, "funny": 1, "cool": 7, "text": "When I first moved to Atlanta in the early 2000s, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers were often a formidable opponent. The Bucs and the Falcons have been in the same division, the NFC South, since 2002. They formed the NFC South division with the Falcons, Carolina Panthers, and New Orleans Saints that year. That same season, the Bucs won the Super Bowl (Super Bowl XXXVII) against the Oakland Raiders, 48-21.\n\nCoincidentally, that was coach Jon Gruden's first year with the Bucs after spending the first four years of his NFL head coaching career with the Raiders. Gruden would eventually wind up with a 57-55 record with the Bucs, spanning seven seasons (2002-2008). Over that period, the Bucs won the division three times (2002, 2005, 2007).\n\nMy favorite Madden NFL game by EA Sports was Madden NFL 2004 for the PlayStation 2. I liked that edition the best because it featured Mike Vick on the cover and he was awesome to play as in a video game. He played for the Falcons at the time. The game was released in late summer 2003 which meant the Bucs were good. They were the reigning champs.\n\nThe 2000s Bucs had players like Derrick Brooks (LB), Warren Sapp (DT), Mike Alstott (FB), John Lynch (SS), Ronde Barber (CB), and Simeon Rice (DE).\n\nAt the time of writing this review, the Bucs all-time record against the Falcons is 25-28 so it's been a pretty even and competitive series between the two teams.\n\nUnfortunately, the Bucs haven't done much since the Gruden era. After losing in the Wild Card playoffs in January 2008 (2007 season), the Bucs have routinely finished in 3rd or 4th place in the NFC South. Granted, the division has been quite strong and competitive some years such as in 2010 when the Falcons went 13-3, the Saints went 11-5, and the Bucs went 10-6, but more often than not, the Bucs have been well below .500. Since Gruden, they've had five different head coaches in 11 seasons -- that's roughly one coaching change every two years.\n\nIn the 2015 NFL Draft, the Bucs drafted QB Jameis Winston with the 1st overall pick. In 2013, as a redshirt freshman, Winston led Florida State to the national championship. I thought the Bucs made a good pick. However, for various reasons (including playing through injury), Winston's career with the Bucs never panned out. He led the Bucs to only one season above .500 (and it was just one game above .500, 9-7, in the 2016 season). He made the 2016 Pro Bowl (2015 season). In the 2019 season, Winston threw seven pick-sixes which set an NFL record. After that season, he became a free agent.\n\nOn March 20, 2020, the Bucs signed QB Tom Brady to a two-year deal that included both no-trade and no-tag clauses. Brady had spent the first 20 (!) years of his legendary career with the New England Patriots. He begins his first season with the Bucs at age 42. About a month after Brady's signing, his former Pats teammate Rob Gronkowski announced he was coming out of retirement. On April 21, 2020, the Pats traded Gronk to the Bucs so he could rejoin Brady. Also, on September 2, 2020 (the date of this review), the Bucs signed Leonard Fournette to a one-year deal. It's like the Miami Heat over here.", "date": "2020-09-02 14:30:04"}, {"_key": "11485568", "_id": "reviews/11485568", "_rev": "_fNzFGnK--S", "review_id": "BTPs5gMSHEOf8ReddSSKcg", "user_id": "j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "business_id": "VAeEXLbEcI9Emt9KGYq9aA", "stars": 4, "useful": 10, "funny": 3, "cool": 7, "text": "We had a wonderful dinner at The Pharmacy Burger Parlor & Beer Garden in East Nashville. If you like burgers, fries, soda, ice cream, shakes, and beer, then this is the place for you.\n\nThe Pharmacy opened in December 2011 and is sort of a throwback to the old-fashioned soda fountains that drugstores used to have, hence the name of the business. They make their own sodas, which they call \"phosphates,\" and associated syrups in-house. In addition to the food and drink mentioned above, The Pharmacy also specializes in German sausages. So, along with the outdoor beer garden, this place has a German slant to it.\n\nThe Pharmacy is located in a primarily residential neighborhood. There's really no dedicated parking lot for the restaurant, except for maybe in the back. Plenty of free street parking exists in the immediate area. We parked along W Eastland Ave, right in front of the restaurant.\n\nWe showed up around 7:30pm on a Saturday night, peak dinner time. The restaurant was slammed with lots of customers waiting on the sidewalk outside. The Pharmacy doesn't take reservations. You can, however, use the Nowait app to get on their wait list before you arrive. This is what we did and it saved us a lot of time. Our party was called shortly after we arrived, so we hardly had to wait.\n\nThe restaurant is fairly spacious with multiple sections of seating, inside and out. There are two bars, one inside and one outside. We sat outside in the beer garden which I thought was pleasant thanks to the cooperating weather. The beer garden, which is fenced-in, contains many picnic tables with trees and various shrubbery surrounding. Some of the tables have umbrellas. String lights decorate the space. Overall, it's a laid back, casual atmosphere.\n\nSausages, which are housemade, come with sauerkraut, mustard, and a side for $11 each. They have a half-dozen different kinds of sausage. The Pharmacy's burgers and chicken sandwiches come on buns made fresh daily by Provence Breads & Cafe, a local artisan bread baker. The burgers are made from beef from Tennessee cattle. There are over a dozen burger and sandwich offerings priced at $9-11 each including a side. You can customize any burger or sandwich with extra toppings costing anywhere from $0.50 to $2 each. Sodas cost $2.50 to $3.50 each with ice cream sodas, shakes, and malts $5 each. The ice cream comes from The Pied Piper Creamery, a local handmade ice cream parlor.\n\nThe beer menu is sizable with many German beers on tap and bottled. They carry a lot of local and domestic craft brews too. In addition, they offer cider and a handful of wines, both by the glass and bottled.\n\nWe ordered a Biergarten Platter ($17) for the table. It's a sausage sampler that comes with any three wurst, kraut, horseradish mustard, beer mustard, and a side. For our wurst, we chose Jagerwurst (pork wurst with coriander, garlic, mustard seed, nutmeg, and ginger), Currywurst (classic brat poached and simmered with pils beer, topped with curried paprika and tomato sauce), and Bockwurst (beef and pork wurst with schwarzbier - black beer, dark lager). For our side, we chose tater tots. The platter also came with a couple pieces of grilled bread which the menu didn't specify.\n\nThe Biergarten Platter was delicious and I recommend it. I can't say I preferred one sausage over another because they were all equally good. Each sausage was flavorful and savory and each had its own distinct taste. The sausages were served up hot. They were firm on the outside and delectably soft on the inside. They had some nice char too. The mustards and kraut paired well. I liked the thicker horseradish mustard over the beer mustard, but both were yummy. The tots were par for the course which means they were scrumptious. I haven't encountered many places with bad tots.\n\nI ordered a Pharmacy Burger ($9) for myself. The Pharmacy cooks their burgers medium well by default so that's how I had mine (I normally like to order my burgers medium or medium rare). The Pharmacy Burger is pretty basic. It comes with yellow cheddar, iceberg lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, and yellow mustard. I got hand-cut fries for my side. The portion size for this meal was large. The burger was big and filling. While I wouldn't put it among the best burgers I've had, it was still quite enjoyable and memorable. The bun was certainly unique. It was soft and buttery. The fries were fine. They were more on the soft than crispy side.\n\nI had to try one of the sodas so I got the Creamiscle ($3.50). The Creamsicle is made with orange soda, cream, and vanilla syrup. It was excellent. I'm really glad I got it. It was ice cold, refreshing, sweet, creamy, and had an appetizing bite to it. The Pharmacy's sodas are made without any preservatives, caffeine, corn syrup, or artificial flavorings. I suggest trying one.\n\n\"Grace Anatomy\" was our server and she did a great job.

The Cards have won 11 titles which is more than storied franchises such as the Athletics (9), Red Sox (9), Giants (8), and Dodgers (7). It's the most championships of any National League team. Since their first championship in 1926, the Cards have had a long, sustained success with multiple World Series appearances in every decade except for a few (1950s, 70s, and 90s). The Cards' latest World Series wins were in 2006 and 2011 and the team's last appearance in the Fall Classic was in 2013.\n\nThe Cards' success in the 2000s and 2010s has been under current owner and chairman Bill DeWitt Jr. DeWitt, along with other partners, purchased the team from Anheuser-Busch in 1995. Since then, the Cards have won the two aforementioned World Series (2006, 2011) and four NL pennants (2004, 2006, 2011, 2013) and made the postseason 15 times. Also during this span, Cards players and managers have racked up numerous awards, most notably Albert Pujols.\n\nPujols is a for-sure future Hall of Famer. With the Cards, he was named the NL MVP three times (2005, 2008, 2009) and was the unanimous NL Rookie of the Year in 2001. To go along with Pujols' MVP award in 2005, Cards starting pitcher Chris Carpenter won the 2005 NL Cy Young Award. Both Pujols and Carpenter were on the 2006 and 2011 championship teams. Additionally, Cards shortstop David Eckstein was named World Series MVP in 2006 and third-baseman David Freese was named World Series MVP in 2011. In the DeWitt era, former manager Tony La Russa (2002) and current manager Mike Shildt (2019) have been named NL Manager of the Year.\n\nThe Cards' current home, Busch Stadium III, is the biggest stadium in the NL Central Division and it's one of the biggest in the National League at approximately 45,500 seats. The current stadium opened in April 2006, just in time for the Cards' 10th World-Series-winning season.

The rolls here were cooked to order and delicious. They were also affordable and served up fast. What more can you ask for?\n\nWe had a late check-in at our hotel and were hungry. We ended up leaving our hotel for dinner around 11:15pm. I looked on Yelp for a good, quick, casual place to eat that was also open late. We were tired and I didn't feel like eating at a sit-down restaurant. Masala Kitchen popped up and checked all the boxes. They're open until 3:30am on Friday and Saturday nights. A friend also recommended this place to us.\n\nThis is a small fast-casual restaurant located in Center City, just four blocks from Philadelphia City Hall. It's right next to the entrance of a public parking garage. Seating inside is limited to about 24 seats. They have standard two-tops with Tolix chairs and a couple long high-tops with Tolix stools.\n\nDuring our visit late on a Friday night between 11pm-12am, there was a small, but steady stream of customers. Most of the orders were takeout and delivery. We were the only dine-in customers at the time. The restaurant had plenty of staff on-hand. The kitchen is open. Bottled and canned drinks (from a fridge), sauces, eating utensils, and napkins are self-serve. The space itself is simple and looked relatively new and clean. The ambiance is that of a takeout joint. Since this restaurant is close to a lot of bars, it's perfect for those wanting a late-night snack or meal after a night on the town.\n\nThe menu is in the business name: kati rolls and platters. Kati rolls are an Indian street food from Kolkata (Calcutta), West Bengal. Masala Kitchen offers 14 varieties of kati rolls, ranging in price from $4.50 to $5.75 a roll. Buy two kati rolls, get $1 off. One or two rolls is good enough for a meal for most people. Ingredient options include chicken, beef, lamb, paneer (cheese), egg, vegetables, potatoes, Indian spices, and more.\n\nThe platters remind me of the platters you can get from The Halal Guys. For example, they have a Chicken-N-Rice platter ($8.75) and the self-serve sauces are similar too -- creamy white and spicy red. In addition, you can get biryani ($9.25-$10.00 each) and a paneer platter ($10). Drinks include mango and rose lassi ($3.70 each), chaas (an Indian yogurt drink, $3.70), masala chai ($3), and more.\n\nThe two of us ordered and split the following three rolls:\n\n* Chicken Masala ($5.75) - marinated grilled chicken with Indian creamy tomato sauce \"Makhani\" and crispy onions\n* Achari Paneer ($5.50) - marinated paneer with hint of mango pickle sauce, fresh mint-coriander chutney, and crispy onions\n* Mix Veggie ($5.50) - fresh pea, carrot, and green bean mixture cooked in Indian spices with fresh mint-coriander chutney and crispy onions plus egg (+$0.50)\n\nThese rolls were great. My favorite was the achari paneer, but I'm fan of paneer. Everything was made fresh to order and came out piping hot. Each roll was wrapped in brown paper and Sharpied to identify the rolls.\n\nThe kati rolls are wrapped in what the restaurant calls a \"tawa roti.\" Traditionally, tawa refers to the round, flat metal griddle used in Indian cooking. The roti here had a nice thickness to it, soft, and kind of fluffy with a sort of pillowy texture, lightly charred and appetizing. I like to describe Masala Kitchen's kati rolls as the Indian equivalent of the Taco Bell Chalupa or Gordita. In terms of the shell/wrap, they are more similar to the Gordita (softer, less crispy, not deep fried).\n\nEach of the rolls was packed with flavor. If you like Indian food, I don't think the kati rolls here will disappoint you. The authentic, aromatic, and mouthwatering flavors were all there. The Mixed Veggie roll had a mushier consistency than the other rolls, but that wasn't surprising given the ingredients. I think adding egg to that roll really enhanced it. On the menu and item descriptions above, \"crispy onions\" refer to fresh, raw slices of red onion.\n\nFor sauces, I recommend getting a cup of the white sauce, adding a little bit of red to it, and mixing them together. The red sauce is quite spicy so a little goes a long way. The sauces by themselves are tasty too, so really it's a matter of personal preference. I dipped the rolls into the sauce mixture each time I took a bite. Yum.\n\nVaishali was our server and she was nice. Masala Kitchen uses the Revel POS system.

The restaurant is located just outside the French Market on Frenchman St, in a lower-key, musically-influenced area of town.  I was looking forward to trying out their fried oyster po' boy, but unfortunately, the restaurant was out of oysters.  They use only Louisiana oysters and because of the oil spill in the Gulf, they cannot serve any dishes with oysters.  Boo.\n\nI subbed in a fish (catfish, I assume) po' boy instead and it was delectable.  It had catfish, shredded lettuce, slices of tomato, mayo, and pickles, inside a loaf of French bread.  With a side of fries, it was yummy and filling.\n\nSmall note on the fries: the menus have printed the fries are only $1.50 extra when ordered with a po' boy.  However, the restaurant charged us $2.00 and the server told us there was a sign out front that noted the change.  The menus still say $1.50 though.  The restaurant needs to correct this.  How are you just going to leave incorrect pricing in your menu (50 cents isn't a lot, but it's the principle)?\n\nWe were told by our waitress to try their fried chicken next time.  The waiters and waitresses are dressed in white dress shirts and black slacks with black top hats and suspenders.  The floor is tiled in black and white tiles.

Both businesses are located in Pie Town, a neighborhood on the southern edge of downtown Nashville. There's not a whole lot of stuff in this part of town. These are definitely two of the highlights.\n\nTennessee Brew Works opened on August 18, 2013. It's popular. This place has won numerous awards and earned plenty of recognition including the best brewery in Tennessee according to Yelp. These folks are all about being local, green, and sustainable. The taproom is two stories with views of the brewery from both floors. There's a patio with both covered and uncovered spaces (mostly uncovered) as well as a small, string-lit rooftop patio. As this is a brewery, the property has an industrial, warehouse feel to it, much like the other businesses in Pie Town. It's clean and modernized. The first floor of the brewery features a small stage for live music (a band was setting up on our way out) and the room upstairs, which is much more spacious, has TVs playing sports and nice overhead views of the brewery floor below.\n\nBrewery tours take place every Saturday at 3pm, 4pm, and 5pm. It costs $10 plus tax and a fee per person. Tickets for the tour can be purchased online.\n\nAlong with high-quality craft beer, the brewery also serves food. Their limited menu includes apps/snacks like Baja fish tacos, Springer Mountain chicken wings, salads, burgers, and sandwiches (including a Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich). Food prices range from $8 to $18 per plate.\n\nWe grabbed a few beers and hung out inside the taproom downstairs. Downstairs, they use barrels (some with tabletops) for tables with bar stools. We showed up around 2pm on a Saturday and the place was busy. It wasn't slammed or jam-packed, but most of the tables upstairs and downstairs were taken. Our group of six was lucky to find a table in a corner next to some brewery windows. The atmosphere was very relaxed and laid back. The staff was cool and friendly. We all enjoyed our time here.\n\nI don't think Tennessee Brew Works has dedicated parking. We parked for free on the street (Middleton Street because we also went to Third Man Records).

It's managed by the city's Parks & Rec department. This is a great sightseeing spot in Philly. I recommend it. The views are beautiful.\n\nSome quick Q&A:\n\n1. Why is it called Logan Circle?\n\nBecause it serves as a major traffic circle for Benjamin Franklin Parkway (https://www.yelp.com/biz/ben-franklin-parkway-philadelphia), connecting it to North 19th Street, Vine Street, and Race Street.\n\n2. Why is it called Logan Square?\n\nBecause it was one of five squares originally planned for the city in 1864 by William Penn, founder of Pennsylvania.\n\n3. Who is the circle/square named after?\n\nJames Logan, 14th mayor of Philadelphia.\n\nLogan Circle is actually surrounded by three other parks: Aviator Park, Sister Cities Park, and Shakespeare Park (small). Combined, the land area for these four parks, including the roads (Benjamin Franklin Parkway is wide and scenic) is about four city blocks. So for a city park, it's not huge, but not small neither.\n\nThe highlight of Logan Circle is a large fountain in the center called the Swann Memorial Fountain: https://www.yelp.com/biz/swann-memorial-fountain-philadelphia-2. We visited on a bright and sunny Sunday afternoon and the park was filled with people, both locals and tourists. Even though there were signs that said no swimming in the fountain, I can't tell you how many kids I saw swimming and playing in the fountain. A lot. It almost looked more like a pool or water park than a historic fountain.\n\nLogan Circle is centrally-located between Philadelphia City Hall and the Philadelphia Museum of Art (Rocky Steps: https://www.yelp.com/biz/rocky-steps-philadelphia). Benjamin Franklin Parkway connects all of it. If you've never been to Philly before and want to sight-see, I think walking the parkway between city hall and the museum is a must. Including the aforementioned adjacent parks, Logan Circle is surrounded by sights and attractions including the Franklin Institute, the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University, and the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul.\n\nNote: At the time of writing this review, there's another Yelp listing for Logan Circle. It's called Logan Square Park: https://www.yelp.com/biz/logan-square-park-philadelphia.

I purchased my old Google Pixel phone from the Google Store (online). One of the options I could add to my phone was Device Protection for $99. Device protection is the same thing as phone insurance and Assurant was the provider.\n\nThe coverage I purchased was good for two years from the date I received my phone. The maximum number of accidental damage repairs or replacements under Device Protection was two during the coverage period. My Pixel's camera lenses, both front and back, got scratched. The scratches caused light streaks in my photos and videos so I decided to file a claim and get a replacement.\n\nPer the Device Protection welcome and terms and conditions email I got from Assurant, I filed my claim at https://mydeviceprotect.com/. It was really quick and easy to do, especially since Assurant had most of my information on file from my phone's IMEI/serial number. I filed my claim on a Friday night. In less than 24 hours, someone from Assurant called to verify my information and approve my claim. I received a claim approval email after the call and a shipping notification that Monday (first business day after my claim was approved). I received my replacement Pixel on Tuesday afternoon; basically, in two business days. Fast!\n\nI did have to pay a $79 deductible, but it was totally worth it to me. It was like I got a brand new Pixel for only $178 ($99 for Device Protection + $79 deductible). Technically, the phone was refurbished, but it looked and worked like new - the battery too, which was huge, since my old battery was on its way out. Considering my particular phone model at the time, a 32-GB Pixel 1, originally retailed for $649, I thought this was a good deal. Plus, I had one more replacement remaining on my contract before my two years were up. It was nice to have that peace of mind.\n\nGoogle made it easy to transfer all of my apps and data from my old Pixel to my new Pixel. I just connected the two phones with a USB-C cable and followed the prompts. The entire transfer took about an hour (my new Pixel had to download and install almost 100 apps). I was really pleased with how simple and seamless the transition was. My old phone was essentially mirrored to my new one which was exactly what I wanted. I did have to set up new fingerprint recognition and log in to all of my apps again, but that was it. I was back up and running with a \"new\" phone with hardly any interruption.\n\nI returned my old Pixel in the same packaging that my new Pixel came in. Assurant emailed me a shipping label to print and tape to the outside of the box. I had to return my old Pixel within 14 days from the date my new Pixel was shipped. Otherwise, I could've been charged an \"unrecovered equipment fee\" of up to $2,000.\n\nIn the end, I am very happy with the Device Protection I purchased from Assurant. I already bought it again for my latest phone, the Pixel 3, for $129 (unsurprisingly, the insurance price went up).", "date": "2019-02-03 16:24:22"}, {"_key": "5206545", "_id": "reviews/5206545", "_rev": "_fNzF1h---M", "review_id": "xNTO7hUoAIx9I2uL0s8K-g", "user_id": "j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "business_id": "pCmaISSyKum22MOtPOxL-w", "stars": 3, "useful": 10, "funny": 3, "cool": 8, "text": "The Philadelphia Phillies are one of the oldest American professional sports franchises, established in 1883. Unlike other storied teams, the Fightin' Phils have never left their original city.\n\nIt took nearly 100 years, but the Phillies were able to win their first World Series championship in 1980 and then again, 28 years later, in 2008. In 1980, future Hall-of-Famer and perhaps the greatest third baseman of all time, Mike Schmidt, led Philadelphia to a 4-2 series win over the Kansas City Royals. In 2008, four-time All-Star pitcher Cole Hamels led Philly in a dominating series performance over the Tampa Bay Rays, 4-1. (Since 2020, Hamels has played for my favorite team, the Atlanta Braves.)\n\nThe Phillies play at Citizens Bank Park, located in South Philly. The ballpark opened in 2004 and is part of the South Philadelphia Sports Complex which includes the adjacent Lincoln Financial Field (home of the NFL's Philadelphia Eagles) and Wells Fargo Center (home of the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers). You can see the complex from the interstate (I-95) as you drive into the city from the airport. It's just across the Delaware River from New Jersey.\n\nThe Phillies haven't done well since 2011, the last year they made the playoffs. From 2012 to present, they've yet to finish a single season above .500 (they finished at exactly .500 twice, in 2012 and 2019), a far cry from their 2008 championship. However, the Charlie Manuel (manager) years (2005-2013), immediately preceding the current playoff drought, comprise a great era in Philadelphia's baseball history. Under Manuel, the Phillies made the playoffs five straight seasons (including that '08 World Series title), had first baseman Ryan Howard named NL Rookie of the Year in 2005 and then NL MVP the following year in 2006, shortstop Jimmy Rollins named NL MVP in 2007, and pitcher Roy Halladay named NL Cy Young Award winner in 2010. Unfortunately, the team hasn't been the same since Manuel's firing during the 2013 season.\n\nAt the time of writing this review, the Phillies have an all-time win percentage of .472 (9,853 wins against 11,032 losses).", "date": "2021-02-12 20:10:07"}, {"_key": "5248501", "_id": "reviews/5248501", "_rev": "_fNzF3_e--M", "review_id": "Ez_VZ6uSsna2r9tGKbWbKA", "user_id": "j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "business_id": "TgbI5_wXWa82NBVwkvC0yQ", "stars": 4, "useful": 5, "funny": 1, "cool": 3, "text": "We stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott Philadelphia Plymouth Meeting and really enjoyed our stay. Everyone at the hotel seemed nice, especially Kim, the lady who checked us in. Kim set the tone and was really welcoming and affable. The hotel and amenities were nice considering the tier of hotel and price paid. We were part of a wedding block and were charged $119.90 per night after taxes. Not bad.\n\nIf you're not familiar with Philadelphia, this hotel is located in the suburbs northwest of town. There's plenty of free parking and the hotel is located within walking distance of a big shopping mall, Plymouth Meeting Mall, that is anchored in part by a Whole Foods. Aside from the mall, if you don't have a car, you're going to have to Lyft/Uber to get anywhere.\n\nThis Courtyard by Marriott is four stories. Our room was 335 on the 3rd floor. It was a \"KSOF\" (king with sofa bed) room with a view of the parking lot and office building to the north. The hotel is surrounded by several office buildings so I suspect a lot of business travelers stay here to work at those buildings.\n\nFrom the outside, the hotel looks like your standard Courtyard by Marriott. Inside, it looks like some renovation work has been done. The place was clean and looked fairly modern. While there's no full-service restaurant or shop, there is a fast-casual counter where you can order made-to-order food and drinks, a small retail corner with grab-and-go items, some dining and lounge-like areas, and a business center of sorts. There's also an indoor pool, hot tub, and gym. The gym is tiny. Outside in the back is a little courtyard with nice landscaping and additional seating. It's worth exploring and checking out.\n\nWhen we checked in, Kim handed us two bottles of water and two Peanut Chews, delicious candy bars that are manufactured in Pennsylvania.\n\nOur room was clean and comfy, and contemporary in design. The toiletries, such as the shampoo, conditioner, and body wash, were Paul Mitchell Tea Tree brand. The bathroom had a standard tub and shower with a floor that was tastefully tiled. The bed was very comfortable, from the soft-yet-firm mattress to the silky-smooth and smell-good sheets. There was an artsy-looking couch (sofa bed) with a conveniently-angled end table. The office desk was extendable which was great for more surface space. The TV was a smart TV with apps like Netflix and YouTube installed. There was a coffee maker, iron and ironing board, luggage rack, and hair dryer. The Wi-Fi was free and fast enough. And there was free, self-serve, tasty coffee and fruit-flavored ice water in the lobby.\n\nStandard check-in time is 3pm and check-out is 12pm. I used the Marriott Bonvoy app to keep track of my reservation and make an early check-in (12pm) request. The hotel (Kim) was quick to respond to my chat messages in the app and she remembered me from our chat conversation when I showed up in person to check-in. I like how they stay on top of that. Saturday night, when the lobby was used for the wedding after-party, I called in a request for additional toiletries and housekeeping was reasonably quick to respond despite the craziness going on downstairs. I appreciated that.\n\nOverall, I think this is a very good mid-tier hotel.

The Flyers won back-to-back Stanley Cups in 1974 and 1975. The team's number of championships (2) is tied for 11th best in the league. Historically, the Flyers have been a perennial playoff team. All time, the team ranks in the top 10 in total playoff seasons. However, over the last decade, the Flyers have only made the playoffs on average about every other year. All things considered, Philadelphia has been home to one of the NHL's better-performing franchises.\n\nThe Flyers are among the NHL's second-oldest members. They were part of the second wave of franchises that joined during the league's 1967 expansion. That expansion saw the league size double from six teams (the Original Six) to 12 teams. Of the 1967 expansion teams, Philadelphia was the first to win the Stanley Cup. Another 1967 expansion team, the in-state rival Pittsburgh Penguins, have won the Stanley Cup five times (the most of any of the expansion teams from that year). After winning back-to-back titles in 1974 and 1975, the Flyers went on to appear in six more Stanley Cup Finals, the latest in 2010.\n\nFour of the Flyers' six retired jersey numbers belong to players who won the Stanley Cup. They include goaltender Bernie Parent, defenseman Barry Ashbee, left-winger Bill Barber, and center Bobby Clarke. Parent is a legend among goalies and a Philadelphia sports icon. Clarke was the captain of both teams that won the Stanley Cup. Parent, Barber, and Clarke were all inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. Ashbee was a member of the 1974 championship team, but his career was unfortunately cut short from an eye injury he suffered in the Flyers' series preceding the Stanley Cup Finals. Tragically, only about three years later, Ashbee passed away from leukemia at age 37.\n\nThe Flyers' home arena is the Wells Fargo Center. With a present seating capacity of 19,600 (the number can vary depending on where you look; 19,600 is from the Wells Fargo Center website), the Wells Fargo Center is the fourth-biggest arena in the NHL. The Flyers and the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers have been the building's only two full-time occupants since the building opened in 1996. The seating capacity for Sixers games is slightly larger at 21,000.

Sadly, Edmonton has only made the playoffs twice since losing to the Carolina Hurricanes in a heartbreaking Game 7 in the 2006 Stanley Cup Finals. However, their history in the 80s cannot be denied. The Oilers won the Cup five times in seven years: 1984, 1985, 1987, 1988, and 1990. To date, the Oilers are tied with the Pittsburgh Penguins for the sixth-most number of Stanley Cup championships. The Oilers and the Penguins have the most NHL titles outside of the Original Six. A finer point, the Oilers franchise did not join the NHL until 1979 while the Penguins were part of the league's 1967 expansion. It's impressive how many championships Edmonton racked up after being a member of the NHL for only about a decade.\n\n\"The Great One\" Wayne Gretzky, started his NHL career with Edmonton. He is the franchise's all-time scoring leader in both goals (583) and points (1,669). Unlike many of the great hockey players today, Gretzky was not drafted. He played in the now-defunct World Hockey Association (WHA) for Edmonton for one season before the WHA folded. After that, the Oilers joined the NHL and the rest is history. Gretzky won all four of his Stanley Cups with Edmonton. He left the team in 1988 when he was traded by the Oilers to the Los Angeles Kings. The Oilers would go on to win the following Stanley Cup without him and Gretzky would never win another Cup again.\n\nToday, Connor McDavid is the Oilers' best player. He's currently considered one of the best players in hockey. Edmonton drafted him with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft. Already, McDavid has won the Hart Memorial Trophy (NHL regular season MVP in 2017; Gretzky won the Hart Trophy nine times), the Ted Lindsay Award twice (NHL regular season most outstanding player in 2017 and 2018), and the Art Ross Trophy twice (NHL regular season most points in 2017 and 2018). He was also on the cover of EA Sports NHL 18. He's quickly climbing up in the franchise record books.\n\nThe Oilers' current home is Rogers Place, located in downtown Edmonton. Opened in 2016, Rogers Place is one of the NHL's newest arenas. It has over 1,250 TV screens and the largest HD center ice scoreboard in the league. For hockey, Rogers Place has a seating capacity of 18,347. The Edmonton Oil Kings of the Western Hockey League (WHL) have also called Rogers Place home since 2016.

It's located just one block away from Philadelphia City Hall and is adjacent to the very popular Reading Terminal Market, so it's convenient to other must-see spots in the city.\n\nBy my count, Chinatown takes up about 21 city blocks. The Pennsylvania Convention Center takes up roughly a quarter of the neighborhood. Like other Chinatowns in big American cities, Philly's Chinatown is relatively old and densely-packed. Food is a big draw, of course, with restaurants serving not only Chinese food like dim sum and Peking duck, but also Japanese ramen and yakitori, Korean fried chicken, Malaysian, Thai, and Vietnamese cuisine, and vegetarian food. There are also Asian bakeries and bubble tea galore.\n\nThe official entrance to Chinatown is located on the south side of the neighborhood on N 10th St at Arch St. The gate is known as the Friendship Gate or Friendship Arch (https://www.yelp.com/biz/chinatown-friendship-gate-philadelphia). It's a vehicular gate and, ironically, traffic flows only one-way: out of Chinatown. N 10th St is also home to the Chinese Cultural & Community Center as well as the Mandarin-language campus of the Chinese Christian Church & Center (https://www.yelp.com/biz/chinese-christian-church-and-center-philadelphia-2).\n\nI attended a wedding at the church's Vine Campus which is less than a five-minute walk away. Vine St forms Chinatown's north border with N Broad St to the west, N 7th St to the east, and Arch St to the south.

The gate is located on N 10th St at Arch St. It's 40 feet tall and weighs 88 tons. It's called the Friendship Gate because it symbolizes the friendship between Philly and its sister city in China, Tianjin. The gate officially \"opened\" (was dedicated) in January 1984 with a rededication in 2008.\n\nThis is a neat landmark and worth checking out if you've never been to Philly Chinatown before. It's ornate and colorful and makes for a nice photo/selfie. The architectural style comes from the Ming (1368 to 1644) and Qing (1644 to 1912) dynasties. I think Philly's Chinatown gate trumps San Francisco's Chinatown gate, Dragon Gate (http://bit.ly/2Yy21uu), in terms of size and decor, but SF's gate is actually three gates in one (two gates for pedestrians and one for vehicles). This gate is built over vehicular traffic only: two one-way car lanes and one one-way bike lane, all heading south out of Chinatown and into Center City.\n\nIf you're visiting Philly from out of town, I recommend going to Tea Do (http://bit.ly/2M9XSWV) one block north of the gate and Reading Terminal Market (http://bit.ly/2OOoUFG) two blocks east.\n\nAfter leaving a review for this gate, I realized I never left one for the SF version (http://bit.ly/2Yy21uu).

I'm getting hungry just writing this review.\n\nSince 2012, Hattie B's has grown into a small chain specializing in Nashville hot chicken. This location, in the Melrose neighborhood of Nashville, is the company's third and newest location in the city. It's relatively new, having opened less than a year ago (November 2017). A location recently opened in July 2018 where I live in Atlanta. At the time of writing this review, the chain's newest location opened last month in August 2018 inside The Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas.\n\nWhile Hattie B's isn't the originator of Nashville hot chicken (Prince's Hot Chicken Shack was the first and many say they do it better), Hattie B's has done a lot to popularize it in the last six-plus years.\n\nWe visited this location on a Friday shortly after the business opened at 11am. This was my first visit to a Hattie B's and I heard the restaurants often have long lines/waits. Since we arrived early, we barely had to wait. This is a fast-casual joint where you place your order and pay upfront at the counter and then wait for your food to be served to you. Fountain drinks, tea, and lemonade are self-serve.\n\nThe ample seating at this location - it's got a spacious dining room and covered patio - was the main reason we chose to come to this location over the other two in Nashville. It turned out to be the right choice. The place was mostly empty when we arrived, but was packed with a line out the door and spilling onto the sidewalk when we left shortly after 12pm. So, if you want to avoid a wait, arrive early.\n\nThe restaurant itself looks great. It looks like new construction. A functional, modern design with a somewhat vintage Southern feel. There's a fenced-in lawn outside, next to the patio, with umbrella-covered picnic tables and cornhole. TVs inside and out. It was nice and clean during our visit.\n\nHattie B's serves hot chicken plates that come with different types of chicken, two Southern sides, bread, and pickles for anywhere from $8.50 for a small dark plate (leg/thigh quarter) to $13.50 for a large white plate (two breast/wing quarters). They also serve wings, tenders, and chicken sandwiches ($9 per sammie). With the hot chicken, you can go with zero heat or choose from five heat levels, ranging in spicy intensity from \"Mild\" (\"touch of heat\") to \"Shut the Cluck Up!!!\" (\"burn notice\").\n\nDesserts include classics like banana pudding, peach cobbler, and floats ($3 each). Aside from the aforementioned non-alcoholic drinks, they serve beer (draft, canned, and bottled) too. Finally, on Sundays from 11am to 4pm, you can get chicken and waffles ($11-16 each) and bacon cheese grits.\n\nWe ordered a bunch of stuff. Here are the things I tried:\n\n* Small dark plate (leg/thigh quarter at medium heat) with pimento mac & cheese and Southern greens ($8.50)\n* Tenders plate ($9.50) - three jumbo tenders (two at medium heat, one at hot) with crinkle-cut fries and creamy coleslaw\n* Large white plate (two breasts/wing quarters) with baked beans and Southern greens ($13.50)\n* One additional tender ($2) at \"Shut the Cluck Up!!!\" spicy\n* Peach cobbler ($3)\n\nThe chicken and sides were yummy. Every piece of chicken, whether it was dark meat, white meat, or a tender was packed with flavor and spice. In terms of enjoyment level, I liked the medium and hot spice levels the best. In terms of taste, I thought the dark meat, naturally, tasted the best. The leg and thigh were tender, juicy, and extra savory. The batter on the dark meat chicken was most crispy and crunchy. Just excellent.\n\nThe tenders were my second-favorite followed by the white meat chicken (breast and wing). All chicken types came with a good portion of meat, particularly the white meat. Despite being white meat, the breast and wing still had a good bit of crunch on the outside and moistness and tenderness on the inside. It was good stuff.\n\nOne bite of the \"Shut the Cluck Up!!!\" tender and my mouth was definitely on fire, but not a sensation I haven't felt before (being a lover of spicy food). However, there comes a point where food gets so spicy that you can no longer taste the food and only feel the heat. At that point, it's not enjoyable anymore. That's what Hattie B's \"Shut the Cluck Up!!!\" is. It's legitimately very spicy, but I don't recommend it to most people unless one just wants to try it for the experience.\n\nEach order of chicken, even the lone tender, were customarily served atop a slice of white bread with two pickles toothpicked on top of the meat.\n\nAs for the sides and dessert, they were OK to great. My favorites (great) were the Southern greens (with pepper sauce), baked beans, and peach cobbler. The pimento mac & cheese was good while the creamy coleslaw was just alright (I don't really recommend the latter).

Completed in 1901, it's the largest city hall in America, covering 14.5 acres of total floor space and rising high at 548 feet (it was the tallest building in Philadelphia until 1986). The building is topped with an enormous statue of William Penn, founder of Philadelphia and Pennsylvania. This statue is its most notable and defining feature. It's situated so high, you can see it from many different places within the city.\n\nCity Hall has made appearances in numerous films including, most recently, the DC superhero movie Shazam! (2019). Something funny happens to William Penn in the movie. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0448115/\n\nThere was also a curse associated with the William Penn statue known as the Curse of Billy Penn. I first learned about it while watching the Rocky location tour documentary Rocky Jumped a Park Bench: https://youtu.be/ryGnmGKbRFo?t=757. In the documentary, host James Rolfe (more famously known as the Angry Video Game Nerd) explains that Philadelphia sports teams were cursed because there was another building in the city that was built higher than William Penn. That curse was broken when the Phillies won the 2008 World Series. Less than 10 years later, the Eagles would go on to win Super Bowl LII (2018). In college sports, Villanova won the 2016 and 2018 NCAA men's basketball championships.\n\nTwo tours are available for City Hall, the Interior Tour and the Tower Tour. The Interior Tour lasts about 1.5 to 2 hours and includes the Tower Tour. The Tower Tour, where you go to the top of the tower for amazing city views, is also available separately. Currently, an adult ticket costs $15 for the Interior Tour and $8 for the Tower Tour (less for military, seniors, and students). Visit the City Hall Visitor Center at 1 S Penn Square, Room 121 and the Independence Visitor Center's website for more info: https://www.phlvisitorcenter.com/CityHall.\n\nNo trip to City Hall is complete without visiting the two relatively new/renovated parks nearby, Dilworth Park (https://www.yelp.com/biz/dilworth-park-philadelphia-9) and Love Park (https://www.yelp.com/biz/love-park-philadelphia).

The apartments are located in the north central part of Center City, just one block north of Chinatown. They're relatively new, having opened in 2017.\n\nAt the time of writing this review, monthly rents start at $1,714 for a 529-square-foot 1 bed/1 bath. 2/2s range from $2,460 for 1,146 square feet to $3,894 for 1,782 square feet with two balconies. Not cheap, but these are \"luxury\" apartments in a prime location with numerous amenities. Amenities include a private clubhouse, billiards/pool table, theater, conference and dining room, gym, courtyards with grills and outdoor fireplaces, bocce, and more. No concierge or swimming pool, however. The apartments have upscale, modern designs with vaulted ceilings. The apartment entrances are interior hallway entrances only.\n\nOne thing that's unique and quirky about Hanover North Broad is the apartment complex is separated into two completely separate buildings. N Broad St, which is a major 6-lane street, splits the two buildings. Our friends live in the East Building, so if they want to go to the gym, they have to cross over a busy street.\n\nWe spent most of our time hanging out and lounging around at the East Building's elevated courtyard. This courtyard was clean with manicured landscaping, bocce, cushioned seating, tables, grills, and cabanas with nice TVs. We couldn't get the fireplace working. I'm not sure what was wrong with it. I was hoping the courtyard would have a nice city view or a view of the street below, but it does not. I'm not sure why they designed it that way; probably because there's not much to look at on Carlton St.\n\nBoth buildings have parking garages that are open to the public for a fee (the ground level of the two buildings includes retail). The East Building garage was brightly lit and felt clean and safe enough. The spaces are tight, not uncommon for big city decks.\n\nThe leasing office is located in the West Building which is also the bigger building of the two.", "date": "2019-10-26 14:49:49"}, {"_key": "6084647", "_id": "reviews/6084647", "_rev": "_fNzGtLm--T", "review_id": "szgJo5R8wSuoyLxbUZrlNA", "user_id": "j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "business_id": "iUZEGx29miZObLd6_lt7Vg", "stars": 4, "useful": 8, "funny": 0, "cool": 4, "text": "We enjoyed our breakfast at Sabrina's Cafe and Spencer's Too in Logan Square, Center City. This local restaurant chain was recommended to us by three separate friends as one of Philadelphia's best spots for breakfast and brunch (they serve lunch and dinner too). The food was good and service was great. While I don't think this place is *significantly* better than other popular and highly-regarded brunch restaurants I've tried, it's still definitely worth checking out if you want American breakfast/brunch comfort food. The food is delicious, though heavy, and the portions are huge and filling.\n\nThere are five Sabrina's locations in the Delaware Valley including three in Philly proper. This location is the second and it opened in 2007 (the first opened in 2001). Sabrina's is named after the owners' daughter. This particular location has \"and Spencer's Too\" in the name because of the owners' son, who was born later. We chose to dine at this location because it was close to our hotel, the Philadelphia 201, which is only a couple blocks away; a short walk. If you're staying at this hotel or anywhere nearby, I do recommend Sabrina's for breakfast/brunch.\n\nI heard this place gets packed with waits the norm. We showed up bright and early on a Monday morning just before opening (8am). A small crowd had already built up on the sidewalk in front of the entrance. When the doors opened, all of us were seated immediately. This place has plenty of space. It has a diner feel to it. You can sit at the counter with its cushioned and pattern-upholstered chairs or at one of the numerous small tables or booths. The atmosphere is casual and homey. There's a tiled coffee bar and lampshades with floral designs.\n\nDuring our visit, the large blackboard menu on the dining room's center wall featured chalk drawings of Sonic and Knuckles (random). Specials included chicken and waffles ($14.95) and dinner entrees like seafood scampi ($15.95) and goat cheese penne pasta ($14.95). We also received a seasonal drink menu and monthly food specials.\n\nSabrina's signature breakfast items are the huevos rancheros ($11.79), stuffed challah French toast ($11.99), and \"The Tots\" ($12.59). Other breakfast/brunch foods include eggs, frittatas, omelettes, pancakes, bagels and lox, housemade granola, avocado toast, and a quinoa bowl. Most of these other items cost about the same or less than the signature items. Most non-breakfast/brunch food includes soups and salads and burgers and sandwiches. Expect to spend about $11-13 each for those items. They have a kids menu too. Beverage-wise, they offer coffee and espresso-based drinks, teas, fresh juices, and Jones brand \"craft\" soda.\n\nWe ordered two signature items and a couple seasonal drinks:\n\n* Stuffed Challah French Toast ($11.99) with farmer's cream cheese topped with bananas and vanilla bean syrup\n* The Tots ($12.59) - fried panko-encrusted tater tots topped with grilled hot sausage hash; caramelized onions, bell peppers, and fennel seed; topped with basil chimichurri, sour cream, and over-easy eggs\n* Cookie Butter Iced Mocha ($4.79) - cookie butter, dark chocolate, espresso, and milk\n* Iced Strawberry Mocha ($4.79) - strawberry, dark chocolate, espresso, and milk\n\nThe food was great. I preferred the Stuffed Challah French Toast over The Tots, but I could change my mind given the day. The French toast was outstanding. The best thing about it to me was the filling: farmer's cream cheese. I'm a cream cheese fan in general, but this particular cream cheese was lighter and less dense than your typical American cream cheese. Its silky smooth texture trended towards whipped cream. Overall, wonderful flavor when combined with the vanilla bean syrup (I love vanilla). Ripe slices of banana and a bit of cinnamon and powdered sugar were thrown on top. The consistency of the French toast itself was soft, springy, and appetizing. I recommend this dish.\n\nThe Tots was heavy, but satisfying. It's a lot of food packed into a medium-sized bowl. The panko-encrusted tater tots were bigger than average tots. They were like tots on steroids. The ingredients, particularly the hot sausage hash and the over-easy eggs, came out temperature hot from the kitchen. I had to wait for the bowl to cool down a bit. This one was a savory, greasy smorgasbord of textures and flavors. I had the tots with ketchup and ate the rest of the dish with various hot sauces at the table (Cholula, Frank's RedHot, Sriracha). If you have a ravenous appetite, The Tots is for you; it's packed with lots of carbs and protein.\n\nThe iced mochas were good. They were expectedly sweet; almost too sweet for me (and I have a sweet tooth). I liked the Cookie Butter Iced Mocha better than the Strawberry. Both drinks were rich, flavorful, and refreshing. The dark chocolate flavor was strong. If you order these, you might ask if you can adjust the sweetness.\n\nPatricia was our server and she was attentive and sweet.

It's supposed to close this month (July 2018) so I wanted to get my review out before they closed.\n\nWe showed up just before midnight on Friday and this place was packed. The line to get in wasn't very long, but it was very crowded inside, especially on the first floor. There were two bands, one on the first floor (ground level) as soon as you walk in and one inside on the rooftop (fourth level). I believe both bands were cover bands (definitely the band on the top floor; I remember one song they sang was the Alien Ant Farm version of Smooth Criminal). Both bands were pretty good and most people seemed to be having a good time.\n\nThere are a lot of lights and neon signs on Broadway. You can't miss Paradise Park's sign because it's one of the biggest. It's green and red and spans over two stories. It's one of the most prominent signs on the street. The space has colorful and kitschy decor (neon signs, string lights, Christmas lights, a disco ball, and more). Just inside the entrance is a photo booth and Skee-Ball. During our visit, the second and third floors were closed. The second floor was home to a dueling piano bar called The Big Bang.\n\nWe spent most of our time on the rooftop patio which was a lot more laid back and relaxed than downstairs. The rooftop has both an interior and exterior bar. The outdoor portion of the rooftop is covered in artificial turf with picnic tables, lawn/porch chairs, and high tops for seating. There was always a game of cornhole going on while we were up there. The highlight, to me, is the view from the rooftop. You get to see the beautiful downtown Nashville cityscape as well as all of the activity below on Broadway. Paradise Park seems to be in the center of it all. If it's not closed by the time you read this, the rooftop is definitely worth checking out.\n\nIf you want to use the elevator and it's not working, try punching in 0114 (authorization code).

On our way to City Hall, we happened to pass through Love Park, an urban park that takes up one city block adjacent to City Hall. It's nice. When we visited around 7:40pm on a Sunday, it was clean, spacious, and not crowded.\n\nThere was a big \"I [heart] Philly\" sign with City Hall serving as the ideal backdrop. It was perfect for tourists like us to take a picture with. This place isn't called Love Park because of that sign though. The park got its name from the popular red-colored \"Love\" sculpture on the other side of the park, closer to City Hall. This is the same Love sculpture that's on display in other cities like London, New York, and San Francisco. The original sculpture is inside the Indianapolis Museum of Art.\n\nUnlike other cities, Philly's Love sculpture is propped up high so you can stand and pose for a shot underneath it (as opposed to in front or beside it). The park serves as the southern endpoint for Benjamin Franklin Parkway (https://www.yelp.com/biz/ben-franklin-parkway-philadelphia), a wide one-mile-long street worth walking if you've never been to Philly before. If you look north (technically, northwest) up the parkway, you can see Logan Square (https://www.yelp.com/biz/logan-circle-philadelphia-2) and the Philadelphia Museum of Art (https://www.yelp.com/biz/philadelphia-museum-of-art-philadelphia) with its famous Rocky Steps (https://www.yelp.com/biz/rocky-steps-philadelphia). It's a cool visual.\n\nThe park must have been renovated relatively recently because pictures I've seen of it on Yelp show a fountain which no longer exists. Instead, there's now a big splash pad. Dilworth Park (https://www.yelp.com/biz/dilworth-park-philadelphia-9), one block over, has one too. Kids were having a blast in both. Around Love Park's splash pad are several red lounge chairs.

There's a lot of green space, but perhaps almost equally, a lot of concrete, gravel, and brick. The trees and benches in the brickyard on the southeast end of the square are nice touches.

I thought it was alright.\n\nVirago is part of the \"upscale\" M Street restaurant group which includes five restaurants along McGavock between 12th and 11th Aves. They are: Kayne Prime (steakhouse), Moto (Italian), Saint Anejo (Mexican), Virago, and Whiskey Kitchen (pub grub). We showed up to McGavock around 9:20pm on a Friday night without a reservation to any of these places. After first checking with Whiskey Kitchen and then Saint Anejo, we settled on Virago because they could seat us almost immediately. Whiskey Kitchen and Saint Anejo were packed with waits. There were plenty of open tables at Virago.\n\nVirago is on OpenTable. Book your reservation for free and earn dining points that can be used towards future discounts at select OpenTable restaurants or an Amazon gift card.\n\nAll three of Whiskey Kitchen, Saint Anejo, and Virago looked modern and stylish. It's evident this company has put a lot of money into the construction and design of its restaurants. Virago is the oldest of the bunch. It opened in 2000. It's been in its current spot since 2010 (the original location was in Midtown). This isn't an authentic Japanese or sushi restaurant, but more of a sleek Americanized sushi and Asian fusion joint with a huge drink menu. I'm not a huge fan of these types of places as the food can often be subpar and overpriced. Virago pretty much fell in line.\n\nThe restaurant has a swanky aesthetic. When we visited, it felt a lot like a lounge complete with lounge music and dim lighting. The place is spacious. There's a sizable wraparound sushi bar and multiple dining rooms and seating areas including a large lounge/waiting area with couches. There are private booths, big tables for groups, and a variety of lighting from pendant lights to recessed lighting. This restaurant can easily accommodate groups (we had six in ours) and the candle-lit ambiance is ideal for dates too.\n\nThe dinner menu had a decent selection of Japanese and fusiony food. They included salads and appetizers ($7-14 each) like \"V2 edamame\" (charred edamame with togarashi Japanese spice mix and sweet soy sauce) and yellowtail jalapeno (a popular app); ishiyaki - foods cooked over hot stones ($29-96 per order); agemono - deep-fried dishes ($9-19 each); robatayaki - skewers ($9-24 per order) and meat/seafood ($22-34 each) cooked over charcoal; nigiri and sashimi ($6-15 for two pieces); and makimono - rolls ($13-29 each). They also had chirashi - assorted sashimi over sushi rice ($24 for a small size, $42 for a large), omakase - a chef's tasting ($85 for the \"chef's tour\" and $95 for the \"sushi tour\"), and more. Finally, there were daily specials such as ramen ($17), Waygu strip steak ($30), and matcha sponge cake ($12).\n\nThe drink menu was extensive: cocktails, wine by the bottle or by the glass, over 40 selections of sake (impressive), and all sorts of beer and spirits (scotch, bourbon, Japanese whisky, gin, tequila, vodka, rum, etc.).\n\nHere's what I tried:\n\n* Ishiyaki Wagyu strip, 6 oz. ($35) - hot rock, togarashi salt\n* Chirashi don, large size ($42) - chef's sashimi selection on rice\n* Sake #702. Ozeki Nigori, 375 mL ($17) - crisp and vibrant, unfiltered\n\nIn general, the food was good, though not great, and everything was presented nicely.\n\nThe ishiyaki Wagyu strip was quite tasty though 6 ounces of meat wasn't much. However, what little meat there was was high quality. The meat, which had great marbling, was served raw and cut into thin slices. This was a cook-it-yourself dish. Each slice of meat was cooked, sizzling, on top of a single hot black stone. This dish was 100% meat aside from a miniscule amount of green onion (primarily used as a garnish), oil (I believe it was sesame oil, to help with cooking), two sauces (one a savory dipping sauce and the other a concentrated chili sauce, perhaps Sriracha), and togarashi salt which was more salt than togarashi. Togarashi (or shichimi) contains seven different ingredients including various pepper flakes and sesame seeds. The stone lost its heat towards the end of the meal, so the server had to bring another one. While this dish was yummy, it wasn't filling.\n\nSince I'm allergic to shrimp, I asked for the chirashi don to be prepared without shrimp. There was no shrimp on the plate, but my mouth still experienced a mild allergic reaction. There was definitely some cross-contamination going on. Aside from that, I thought the chirashi was average at best. I order chirashi often at sushi restaurants and Virago's version was simply OK. The large version was filling (at $42, it should be). It contained plenty of thick slices of ahi tuna, yellowtail, salmon, escolar, and albacore tuna plus avocado, cucumber, and multicolored fish eggs (either tobiko or masago).\n\nWe got multiple bottles of the Ozeki Nigori, a cloudy, milky-white sake.

In short, these trips were fine.\n\nI checked prices using kayak.com and booked using delta.com. I flew with my fiancee. For all flights, our seats were assigned at the gate. In all cases, Delta automatically seated us next to each other. We flew coach so we always got one middle seat and one window or aisle seat. On one or two flights, we got the exit row, which was nice. I remember at least one of our flights was on a McDonnell Douglas MD-90.\n\nFor one of the flights, we boarded and sat at the gate in Atlanta for about an hour. This didn't bother me since we weren't in a rush. I just watched Pet Sematary (2019) on my laptop.\n\nWe flew out of and into Atlanta. Our first round trip, arriving on a Friday and departing on a Monday, booked about three months out, cost $303.60 per person. Our second round trip, arriving on a Saturday and departing the following Sunday (quick turnaround), booked about two months out, cost $360.60 per person. Same season. Delta-estimated flight times were anywhere from 1 hour 55 minutes to 2 hours 9 minutes. In actuality, I think one or more of the flights was slightly under 1 hour 50 minutes (in pure flight time).\n\nOn a flight into Atlanta, we were one of the last ones to board, so we had to check our roller bags at the gate (free). Unlike some gate checks where you can pick up your bag at the gate at the destination (usually, on smaller jets), this particular check meant we had to pick up our bags at baggage claim in Atlanta. The Delta app was useful in helping us keep track of our checked bags, letting us know the bag tag numbers and which baggage claim carousel in Atlanta to go to.

One of our flights had a historical on-time rate of 97%.\n\nOur in-flight experiences were fine. No complaints. Each flight included a free drink and and a snack. The snack was a choice of a small bag of Cheez-Its, a single pack of those popular Biscoff cookies (my dad likes to buy boxes of them from Costco), a KIND bar, or almonds (I forget the brand, but it was one of those well-known brands). Not all the snacks I listed were available on every flight, but there were at least two choices on every flight.\n\nWe flew into and out of gates D12 and D14.

The center is located next to Independence Hall within Independence National Historical Park, a park that consists of several blocks in Center City, Philadelphia.\n\nAdmission is free. The bell is owned by the City of Philadelphia and the center is run by the National Park Service. The center is open daily, except Christmas Day, on a first-come, first-served basis. There's not much to the place. You have to go through security (metal detectors, bag inspection) to enter. Once you enter, there's a hallway with various exhibits about the bell including a 10-minute video put together by the History Channel.\n\nOf course, the main attraction is the Liberty Bell itself which is located in a room at the end of the hallway. The bell is roped off so you can't touch it, but you can walk around it. You can view and take pictures of the bell from 360 degrees. The room the bell is located in is cool because the backdrop is Independence Hall (https://www.yelp.com/biz/independence-hall-philadelphia). Admission to Independence Hall is free too. Whoever designed this center did a great job because the backdrop is perfect; very picturesque. The bell is attended/guarded by a National Park Service ranger.\n\nWe visited the center on an ordinary Sunday around 5:40pm. There was a line to enter the building, but it moved fast. We were through security in about 5 minutes. There was a small crowd around the bell, but luckily, everyone was polite and respectful, keeping their distance and taking pictures in turn. Our entire visit at the center lasted less than 20 minutes. We could have spent more time looking at the hallway exhibits, but were hungry and wanted to get to Jim's Steaks (South Street location, about a 15-minute walk away) for a cheesesteak dinner.\n\nThe center was clean, modern, and felt safe.\n\nWe're glad we came here.

How is this a Marriott property? If folks from Marriott corporate saw the condition of this hotel during our stay, they would not be happy. This is easily the worst Marriott property I've stayed at. It certainly didn't live up to the Marriott name/standard. This hotel does have a few things going for it, but the cons definitely outweigh the pros.\n\nFYI, this used to be the Sheraton Philadelphia Downtown.\n\nWe stayed in room 1426 on the 14th floor. This hotel has 26 floors, I believe.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Excellent location. If you want to be close to all of the tourist attractions and hot spots in Philly, this hotel is central to it all.\n\n2. Good value. We paid $119 a night, a wedding block rate, which wasn't too much cheaper than the standard rate. I think this is a good price for a hotel room located downtown in a big city.\n\n3. Friendly staff. From the ladies at the front desk to our housekeeper, Gisella (not sure if I spelled her name right), everyone we interacted with was nice and polite. Even a restaurant server smiled at us as we passed by.\n\n4. Big smart TV. Not the best picture quality or responsiveness, but good enough. It had all the major channels and streaming services. You have to use your own accounts for the streaming services.\n\n5. Fast and free Internet. The Wi-Fi in our room was blazing fast. Great!\n\n6. Good, basic amenities. Luggage rack, iron and ironing board, coffee maker, hair dryer, and toiletries (bar soap, body wash, lotion, shampoo, conditioner). However, they did not offer a couple common amenities; see #4 under Cons below.\n\n7. Cool-looking, modern bathroom. There was a walk-in shower with a hand-held shower head. Both the sink and shower looked relatively new.\n\n8. Elevators were fast.\n\nCons:\n\n1. This hotel was old and it showed. We also happened to stay during the wrong time -- there were signs in the hotel that said, \"Pardon our appearance as we reimagine our guest rooms.\" So we visited before/during a renovation. Everything, it seemed, was on its last legs and the whole place, from the lobby to our room, smelled funny.\n\n2. Our room was in poor condition.\n- All of the furniture was well worn, from the surfaces of the open closet to the edges of the dresser and bathroom shelving.\n- The switch on one of three lamps in our room was broken. In order to turn the lamp on/off, we either had to unscrew the light bulb (which is what I think the previous guest(s) did since the bulb was unscrewed upon arrival) or unplug the lamp from the power outlet. We opted for the latter.\n- The bed old, creaky, and not very comfortable. It was in worse shape than my 14-year-old mattress which I just got rid of recently. Yikes.\n- One of two nightstands was super weak and wobbly. It felt like it was going to fall apart just from a gentle push. I uploaded a video if you want to see.\n- One of two phones was missing buttons.\n- The cabinet door in the bathroom was missing its knob. We couldn't even open it for the duration of our stay.\n- The bathroom faucet looked relatively new and nice, but it wasn't seated/secured properly. It was very loose. Check out my video.\n\n3. Upon check-in, our room was dirty.\n- There was an obvious stain on the carpet in one corner of our room. What could it have been? Coffee? Bodily fluids? I don't think we wanted to know. Check out my photos to see it.\n- The lamps were dusty.\n- The power sockets at our desk were very dusty.\n- The room had a decent view, but it was spoiled by the dirty windows. They were quite dirty from the outside and needed a good wash.\n- The carpet was old, dingy, and frankly, gross. We didn't step on it with our bare feet and instead wore sandals to walk around the room.\n- There were stains on both our bed skirt and comforter.\n- One of two coffee cup lids was dirty on the inside.\n- Perhaps the grossest thing were the tongs for our ice bucket. They had some nasty, brown, sticky stuff on them. It looked like dried-up syrup.\n\n4. Our room did not have the following common amenities (for a Marriott or similar property):\n- Mini fridge\n- Safe\n\n5. Our \"king\" room didn't even have a true king bed. It wasn't even a queen. The bed was smaller than a queen.\n\n6. While the shower was nice, the water pressure was low and the shower head was placed awkwardly in the corner above the retractable seat. This made showering awkward as I'd have to lean over the seat to wash my hair. The shower space wasn't fully utilized. Weird placement.\n\n7. The bathroom didn't have much surface space to put our toiletries, both inside and outside the shower.\n\n8. The AC unit was old and loud. It was one of those wall units with a control panel on the unit itself. There was another thermostat on the opposite wall, but it didn't seem to serve a purpose.\n\n9. There was no ice machine on our floor (14) so I had to go down to 12.\n\n10. Poor security. Anyone could walk into the hotel from any door at any hour it seemed. No key card was required to access the floors either.", "date": "2019-07-10 13:58:37"}, {"_key": "6750626", "_id": "reviews/6750626", "_rev": "_fNzHQRK--e", "review_id": "iwCLEAfzPyUyQ6P6rI5BGg", "user_id": "j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "business_id": "DPtdBtLp6ng9cAB9_rzB6g", "stars": 2, "useful": 8, "funny": 2, "cool": 4, "text": "Our first stop checking out the honky-tonk scene on Broadway was the \"world famous\" and historic Tootsie's Orchid Lounge. Honky-tonks are bars with live country music and Tootsie's is one of the most well-known of these. The business has been around for decades and is named after one of its former owners, Tootsie Bess (now deceased), and the color of the building - orchid. Tootsie bought the place in 1960.\n\nLike several of the venues along Broadway and in Nashville in general, Tootsies has multiple levels with multiple bars and multiple stages plus a rooftop patio. We visited shortly after 11:30pm on a Friday night and the front of the house was jam-packed. Instead of entering through the front, we went through Tootsie's back entrance which is how many of the country music stars used to come after their shows at the Ryman Auditorium (former Grand Ole Opry House) next door. A cool neon sign out back calls it Tootsie's Alley.\n\nIt's a narrow little alley with just enough room for a vehicle to squeeze by. It was just our luck, during our visit, that a garbage truck was making its round to all the businesses behind Broadway, Tootsie's included. Therefore, it absolutely stunk. The heat and humidity at the time didn't help either.\n\nWe spent most of our time on the second level in the back. There was no stage back there so it was one of the least crowded parts of the building. All of the other rooms were pretty full. This part of Tootsie's had its own small bar with three TVs, two arcade games (golf and boxing), and a decent amount of seating (about 25 seats, maybe more). I would describe the space and decor as divey and kitschy. It's old, but it's got character. The air was smelly, the floors were sticky, and it was loud -- admittedly, not my scene, but lots of people (many of whom were tipsy or drunk) appeared to be having a good time. I had more fun at our next stop, the now-closed Paradise Park Trailer Resort across the street. It had a more comfortable and enjoyable environment.\n\nA lot of celebrities have performed at Tootsie's. Garth Brooks popped in unannounced and sang on a fairly recent Thursday night (August 2, 2018). Kid Rock performed, along with others, to celebrate Tootsie's 58th anniversary on October 10, 2018. Both performances were free.\n\nTootsie's also has an offshoot at the Nashville airport as well as another multi-stage honky-tonk in Panama City Beach, Florida.", "date": "2018-10-16 14:28:13"}, {"_key": "6884883", "_id": "reviews/6884883", "_rev": "_fNzHV-6--C", "review_id": "5-A9ouRD-yWCf_WR8hdXng", "user_id": "j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "business_id": "ta5Oi3sezvn4H299MbtE8Q", "stars": 3, "useful": 4, "funny": 1, "cool": 3, "text": "The Carousel Bar is located on the ground level of Hotel Monteleone on Royal St. (parallel to Bourbon St.) in the French Quarter.

I loved this place.\n\nWe stopped by this cafe, located in the Lockeland Springs neighborhood of East Nashville, for a quick pick-me-up before axe throwing. This is a local hipster coffee shop with, at the time of writing this review, five locations in Nashville. The company started in 2011. I believe this location is the original.\n\nThe space looks beautiful, inside and out. It's like a work of art. The business has a nautical theme. Its logo is an anchor with a ribbon wrapped around it. Outside, an anchor is painted on the concrete wall next to the parking lot. The building, which is basically a giant garage, is painted in solid, bold colors - bright blue with burnt orange retractable doors. A large wooden anchor hangs over the storefront.\n\nThe interior is open and spacious with plenty of seating, most of it communal. There are lots of power outlets along the wall which help make this an ideal spot for work/study. The design and decor include distressed wood, pendant lighting, and a cool, blown-up, pixelated image of a ship. The floor looks unfinished, the ceiling is exposed. There are vintage motorcycles on display and a record player playing background music off vinyl. Along with all the seats inside, there are more outside on the covered patio. Overall, this place has a neat, laid back vibe.\n\nThey serve various sorts of coffee here as you might expect including manual drip (pour over) and Yama-siphoned cold brew (the tall one that looks like a science experiment). Most servings cost between $5 to $7 each. They also serve tea like Kilogram-brand artisan tea and cascara tea (a.k.a. coffee cherry tea) ($4 each).\n\nI tried one of Barista's \"specialty\" drinks that include items like bourbon vanilla and Mast Brothers mocha (Mast Brothers is a sustainable chocolate maker). I had a whiskey caramel. I think it was a 12-ounce serving for $5.75 plus tax. It was excellent. The drink was ice cold and refreshing. It really hit the spot. Smooth, sweet, and creamy -- just the way I like most of my coffee. The caramel flavor was evident; the whiskey not so much, but that was okay. I still enjoyed every sip. All of my friends seemed to like what they ordered too.\n\nDuring our visit, the cafe had many whole bean coffee boxes for sale. They included Daredevil (growing region: Guji, Ethiopia), Golden Sound (Mexico and Columbia), Kuquipata (Cusco, Peru), and Nano Challa (Jimma, Ethiopia). Helpful tasting notes were provided on a blackboard above the inventory. For example, tasting notes for the Kuquipata were shortbread, dried cherry, and allspice.\n\nService was terrific.

My friends and I came to NOLA for a bachelor party and one of the things we wanted to do was tackle Pat O's famous three-gallon hurricane.  So we made a reservation and took on the challenge on their back patio (21 and up only) this past Friday afternoon.  A hurricane consists of lime juice, passion fruit syrup, rum, cherries, and oranges.  It's a very sweet and fruity cocktail, almost like drinking Kool-Aid.\n\nThe glass for the three-gallon hurricane is massive.  It actually is a giant five-gallon cocktail glass, but when you factor in the ice, cherries, and oranges, you only get about three solid gallons of hurricane.  We had to put down a $75 deposit for the glass alone because it was so big.  The drink itself was $100.  About 10 of us were able to finish the drink in about 30-40 minutes (I think, don't remember exactly).  The end looks the hardest, where the glass bows out, but it actually turned out a lot easier than we expected because of the the great quantity of ice.\n\nThe massive cocktail drew lots of attention from restaurant patrons and tourists, many of whom asked for photos to which we kindly obliged.  We got our $75 deposit back after finishing the glass.  Our server told us that he has only seen two other groups defeat the three-gallon hurricane.\n\nWhile Pat O's may be famous for their cocktails, they also serve food.  We ate lunch here before taking on the giant hurricane.  The menu is actually more extensive than you'd think of an establishment like this.  They serve a wide variety of Louisiana Creole items and also have lunch specials.  I tried the red beans and rice and it was served with two tasty pieces of  Andouille (French/Cajun) sausage.  Their bread pudding is melt-in-your-mouth good.  Their food is definitely underrated.\n\nOverall, Pat O's gets four stars from me for a fun and very memorable experience.

Jim's South St) were delicious. Several locals recommended Jim's to us instead of popular tourist traps, Pat's and Geno's. At the time of writing this review, Pat's has a 3-star average rating with over 3,900 reviews and Geno's has a 2.5-star rating (yikes) with over 3,100 reviews. Jim's has a better rating (3.5, still not great) with over 2,400 reviews. This place was a solid 4 for us. We really enjoyed it.\n\nJim's Steaks originally opened in Philadelphia in 1939. There are three locations in the city. This location, Jim's South St, opened in 1976 and is currently owned by a separate family than the other two. Aside from the different owners, I'm not sure what other differences there are other than I noticed Jim's South St uses bread from Liscio's Bakery while the other two locations use bread from Amoroso's Baking Company.\n\nWe showed up to Jim's South St around 6:15pm on a Sunday. There was a line out the door and almost around the corner. Inside, the line wrapped around twice. We made it to the ordering counter in about 20 minutes. Not bad. Outside, across the street, the restaurant, bar, and cafe, MilkBoy, had a blackboard propped on the sidewalk advertising a Jim's South St cheesesteak without the wait. I didn't see anyone bite while we were standing outside. I wonder how that works. Can you customize your Jim's cheesesteak at MilkBoy?\n\nJim's South St is cash only. During our visit, a cheesesteak cost $9 even plus 8% tax. Pretty much all sandwiches on the menu were in the $8-10 range. Along with steak and cheesesteak sandwiches, they also served other sandwiches like a pizza steak ($9.75), made with cheese and pizza sauce, and Italian hoagies with ingredients like Genoa salami, ham, capicola, prosciutto, and cheese. Beverage-wise, they offer canned sodas (Pepsi products and Dr. Brown's sodas), Dasani bottled water, juice, milk, and cheap beer.\n\nEvery sandwich is made on the spot to order. The kitchen is open so you can see steak being cooked and sandwiches being assembled quickly and in large quantities while you wait. The restaurant itself feels like an old diner or deli.\n\nWe ordered two sandwiches. One was a cheesesteak with Whiz, mushrooms, and onions ($9.75). The other was a cheesesteak with Whiz and American, and onions ($9). The cheese options are Whiz (Cheese Whiz), American cheese, and provolone cheese, all melted. We also got a Dr. Brown's cream soda ($2.25).\n\nI highly recommend doubling up or getting more than one cheese. It makes a difference. We both preferred the cheesesteak with Whiz and American over the cheesesteak with just Whiz alone. I'm not sure how much it matters, but my fiancee noticed that the mushrooms came straight from a can. I will say they weren't the best-tasting mushrooms (and this is coming from someone who loves mushrooms).\n\nGenerally though, these sandwiches hit the spot. They were served up fast and hot. They were messy to eat, but that's how it goes with cheesesteaks. Each sandwich was large and filling, but we demolished them. I could see two people splitting one sandwich and leaving full. There was a generous amount of meat in both sandwiches and the overall quality, from the rolls to the meat, was good. They were very appetizing and satisfying with all the ideal textures -- tender, moist steak, creamy, melted cheese, and soft yet firm bread.\n\nAdmittedly, the cheesesteaks we had here weren't significantly better than the cheesesteaks from some of my favorite places back home (Atlanta has yummy cheesesteaks too), but we still really liked them. If you want to get a cheesesteak from Philly because that's the food the city is known for, I do recommend Jim's South St.\n\nService was good. The line moved fast and the staff was fine. Some were more polite than others.\n\nThere's no seating downstairs, but there is seating upstairs in what I imagine is an often cramped and crowded dining room. I guesstimate the dining room can seat about 30-40 comfortably. We were lucky and snagged one of the storefront window tables, looking down upon MilkBoy and the intersection of South and 4th Streets. There was an employee upstairs who helped take our trays and throw away our trash when we were done.\n\nJim's South St has one small restroom available for customer use on the ground level.", "date": "2019-09-15 13:18:58"}, {"_key": "7375221", "_id": "reviews/7375221", "_rev": "_fNzHzlq--X", "review_id": "_j2Rt34jR-xS4g22jBdC2w", "user_id": "j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "business_id": "SwJLqp3ngTotqd3kAmPdyw", "stars": 4, "useful": 10, "funny": 2, "cool": 8, "text": "WooJung Sushi was one of Yelp's highest-rated restaurants close to our hotel (Courtyard by Marriott Philadelphia Plymouth Meeting), so that's how we ended up here. The restaurant averaged an impressive 4.5 stars with over 270 reviews. The food was good, though pricey, and service was excellent. The staff was really nice.\n\nWooJung is located in an old-looking strip mall with an eclectic mix of businesses. This independent family business originally opened as Bluefin2 in 2012 before reopening as WooJung in 2015. It's named after the owners' children, Woo and Jung. It's a Korean-owned Japanese restaurant.\n\nWe stopped in on a Saturday shortly after 1pm and the place was completely dead. We were the only customers until a family showed up after us. This is a pretty simple and humble restaurant. It's clean with minimal decor. There's a sushi bar with 8 seats and a dining room with about 40-50 seats. All tables, no booths. This is definitely a \"mom and pop\" shop.\n\nMyung was our server and he was very friendly. Attentive too.\n\nEven though we visited during lunch hours, since it was a Saturday, we got the dinner menu. The lunch menu is served weekdays only, 11:30am-2:30pm. I like nigiri and sashimi, not rolls, and was happy to see WooJung has 25 different kinds of nigiri and sashimi to choose from. Most were priced at $4-7 for 2 pieces. The sushi selection was above average. For example, they offered 3 kinds of shrimp and 2 kinds of yellowtail as well as otoro (tuna belly), uni (sea urchin), ikura (salmon roe), and hokkigai (surf clam). Of course, they have rolls too, which I think are pretty popular. The specialty rolls ran $15-16 each.\n\nAlong with sushi, WooJung sold hot and cold Japanese apps like tempura ($7-9) and tuna tartare ($11); soups and salads (most $5-6), noodles ($8-14), and teriyaki and tempura entrees ($16-18). There are some Korean influences such as Korean BBQ marinade in the tuna tartare and Korean-style chirashi (sashimi over sushi rice, $26).\n\nWe went with the sashimi for 2 entree which cost $70. After tip and tax, lunch for 2 cost over $90, so not cheap. Then again, since it was the weekend, we had to order off the dinner menu.\n\nOur sashimi for 2 entree came with 40 pieces of sashimi. They were as follows:\n\n* 8 pieces of sake (salmon)\n* 8 pieces of maguro (tuna)\n* 8 pieces of hamachi (yellowtail)\n* 8 pieces of suzuki (striped bass)\n* 4 pieces of albacore tuna\n* 4 pieces of shiro maguro (white tuna)\n\nIn addition to the sashimi, the plate came with 2 unagi (broiled eel) hand rolls with cucumber, a little bit of seaweed salad and shredded radish, wasabi, pickled ginger, and thin slices of lemon and lime as garnish. The plate had a nice, clean presentation with no nonsense. Overall, the quality of both the sashimi and the hand rolls was good. We were craving sushi and this hit the spot for us. It was not too heavy and not too light either; it was just the right amount of food. The unagi hand rolls in particular were delicious; flavorful and satisfying. Everything was fresh.\n\nTo nit, the seaweed wrapping on the hand roll was a little tough and didn't break apart easily. The portion size of the seaweed salad was miniscule. At $70, this was the most expensive item on the menu -- it would have been nice if they included 1 or 2 premium types of sushi such as otoro or hamachi toro instead of some of the cheaper fish. That said, I enjoyed all of the different types of sashimi about equally with slight preference to the salmon (one of my faves in general). Note the white tuna is also known as escolar.\n\nThe entree came with the choice of miso soup or salad (2 servings). We both got salads. The salads were better than the standard you typically get at Japanese restaurants because the portion sizes were slightly larger and the salads contained fresh-cut vegetables like carrots and radish. The greens were a spring and spinach mix with arugula.\n\nTo drink, I had a can of Pokka Jasmine Green Tea. This was my first time trying this particular brand. It was slightly sweet and very refreshing. The can was served with a glass filled with ice. I recommend it.\n\nWe got a complimentary dessert. The dessert consisted of 2 small Korean sweet potato balls topped with honey and cinnamon, 2 pineapple bites on toothpicks, and a piece of orange that was served in the skin, but already carefully cut and separated from the skin. It was a delightful, light dessert. The sweet potato balls were soft and delectably chewy, similar to tteok (Korean rice cakes). The pineapple and orange were juicy and ripe.\n\nWe left about 20 minutes before closing (Saturday 2:30pm) and the staff had just sat down to eat. They collectively thanked and said goodbye to us as we left, giving off that sweet, warm, family vibe. No wonder why this place has gained such a following.\n\nThank you for the meal, WooJung.", "date": "2019-11-02 12:18:45"}, {"_key": "7446543", "_id": "reviews/7446543", "_rev": "_fNzH2IG--_", "review_id": "n4kLnHtDmYzQKCY1tyJJGA", "user_id": "j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "business_id": "-QI8Qi8XWH3D8y8ethnajA", "stars": 4, "useful": 11, "funny": 4, "cool": 7, "text": "PHL:\n\nI'm giving Philadelphia International Airport four stars because we've had nothing but good experiences at this airport. Security has been super fast (https://www.yelp.com/biz/tsa-checkpoint-d-philadelphia-international-airport-philadelphia), rideshare pick-up points are conveniently close to the building, the airport has been clean, and it's easy to navigate with no long walks or train/shuttle rides. I'm kind of surprised at how small Philly's airport feels in relation to the size of the city. It feels like a medium-sized city airport. We've only flown Delta into and out of this airport so we've only seen Terminal D.\n\nThere are six terminals, A through F. This is an older airport, beginning as Philadelphia Municipal Airport in 1927. Terminal D opened in 1973 and was last renovated in 2008. The airport isn't much to look at and I wouldn't consider it \"modern-looking\" by any means. However, it's functional and gets the job done well. The hallway connecting Terminals D and E (security exits you right into the middle of this) looks relatively up to date. Terminal D has 16 gates. We've flow into and out of gates D12 and D14 (non-stop flights to and from Atlanta). The terminal has a nice mix of shops and restaurants including Vino Volo (a food and wine bar), Tumi, Dunkin' Donuts (two locations), Jamba Juice, Earl of Sandwich, and more.\n\nOne of the best things about this airport is the free Wi-Fi. It's blazing fast. I connected to the Wi-Fi using my phone and laptop, sitting at the gate, and was really impressed with the internet speeds. All airports should have internet at least as fast as Philly's airport.\n\nThe men's restroom by gate D10 isn't the biggest, nicest, or newest, but it was clean enough.\n\nThere are moving walkways, with nice views of the airport aprons, to help get you through the terminals faster. I appreciate the rideshare pick-up points are just outside baggage claim. You don't have to walk far. You only have to cross one set of lanes and then you can choose your clearly-marked pick-up spot (e.g. D-1, D-2, D-3, etc.).", "date": "2019-11-24 12:40:35"}, {"_key": "7459908", "_id": "reviews/7459908", "_rev": "_fNzH2la--I", "review_id": "O_dVXnc8rwWca0VmpzzMXg", "user_id": "j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "business_id": "x8CnOpGvWz94NolsZWU8XA", "stars": 4, "useful": 10, "funny": 2, "cool": 8, "text": "Since their establishment in 1967, the St. Louis Blues have been a good NHL team. Not only has St. Louis won a Stanley Cup recently (2019), but they're a perennial playoff team, have won 10 division titles, and through the last complete season (2019-20), they rank in the top 10 all-time in points percentage. Outside the Original Six, who joined the league from 1917 to 1926, the Blues have the most playoff appearances (44) of any active team.\n\nBefore winning the Cup in 2019, the Blues had gone exactly 50 seasons without an NHL championship. In the Finals that year, St. Louis went the distance with Boston. The Blues edged the Bruins, four games to three, and won Game 7, 4-1, on the road at TD Garden in Boston. In his first year in St. Louis, center Ryan O'Reilly won the Conn Smythe Trophy (playoffs MVP). \"The Factor\" came up clutch in Games 4 through 7 of the Finals, going on a four-game goal-scoring streak.\n\nAfter the Blues fired third-year head coach Mike Yeo only a little over a month into the 2018-19 season, Craig Berube went on to become only the second interim coach to win the Stanley Cup. Less than two weeks after winning the championship, Berube signed a three-year contract to remain head coach of the Blues through the 2021-22 season.\n\nTwo of the greatest players in franchise history are right-winger Brett Hull, who played for the Blues from 1988 to 1998, and center Bernie Federko, who played for the Blues from 1976 to 1989. Federko was drafted seventh overall in the 1976 NHL Amateur Draft. He was the only player out of the 135 picked that year to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame (2002). \"The Golden Brett\" joined Federko in the Hall seven years later (2009). Hull and Federko currently hold the top two spots in points, goals, and assists in St. Louis regular season and playoff history. Their numbers - 16 and 24, respectively - were retired by the franchise along with five others.\n\nThe Blues have had only two home arenas: (1) St. Louis Arena, a.k.a. the Checkerdome, across from Forest Park, where the team played from 1967 to 1994, and (2) the Enterprise Center, located in Downtown West, where the team has played since the facility first opened as the Kiel Center in 1994.

For the most part, we had no problems, but we did have one bad experience that I'll never forget. It was the absolute worst rideshare experience I've had, on Lyft or Uber, ever. No other ride comes close.\n\nLet me list the things that went wrong:\n\n1. The driver showed up in a car different than the one shown on the Lyft app. As he loaded our luggage in his trunk, I asked him about this and he said the brakes on his official Lyft car needed to be replaced, hence why he showed up in a different car.\n\n2. The driver showed up with windows down, music blaring.\n\n3. The driver was barefoot.\n\n4. The driver had to remove a baby seat and make room in the trunk for us and our luggage.\n\n5. The driver had to stop and get gas because his tank was empty. After filling up, he went inside the convenience store to buy an energy drink. During this time, we waited in his car, uncomfortable and agitated. We had a flight to catch (obvious because of our destination) and I told him that when he was looking for a gas station.\n\n6. The driver drove with the windows down and music blaring. He sped, bobbing and weaving his way through traffic while changing playlists on his phone. He steered with one hand so he could use the other to motion to the beats of the music. I appreciate he wanted us to get to the airport quickly, but his maneuvers on the interstate would be considered dangerous by most people and certainly by Lyft standards. My fiancee and I could only hope we'd make it to the airport safely. The ride lasted almost 40 minutes.\n\nIn the end, we made it to the airport on time and in one piece, but it was not an enjoyable ride. When it was time to rate my ride, I gave the driver 2 stars (generous?) and submitted a condensed version of the above feedback to Lyft. Lyft responded almost immediately to me via email with the following:\n\n\"Hi Daniel,\n\nI'm following up on the incident that you reported regarding your driver. I'm so sorry to hear about your experience. Please know that we are not taking this report any lightly.\n\nYou did the right thing in reporting this driver. I agree that at no point should a driver be doing other activity once a ride is requested. We also do not tolerate drivers who use different vehicle other than what is approved on the platform. Safety is our highest priority, we want every Lyft experience to be a positive one, and we want you to be comfortable with every driver that picks you up.\n\nWhat the driver did does not align with our Communty Guidelines, and your feedback have a great impact to his account standing, which may lead to his removal from the platform. I immediately called [name redacted]'s attention to warn him about this, so we can make sure that this incident doesn't happen again.\n\nWe are continuously educating drivers on how to deliver 5-star ride experiences to valued riders like you, and hearing this feedback surely helps us where to focus our improvement with this driver.I can assure that you will no longer be paired with him, and your report will remain anonymous.\n\nThanks again for letting us know about this.  Please do not hesitate to ask if there's anything else that I can do for you.\n\nBest,\nJanet\nLyft Support  \nhelp.lyft.com\"\n\nThank you, Lyft, for the prompt reply. I did not receive a refund, credit, discount, or anything like that (not that I was expecting one, but just FYI).\n\nIn Philly, this ride was the exception. All of our other rides were fine and sometimes great. For example, our ride with driver Roeun was terrific. 5 stars -- friendly driver, clean car, fun conversation, good driving.\n\nI have noticed that on average, the Lyft drivers' cars in Philly are older and not as nice as the cars in the South; specifically, Atlanta and Nashville. Lyft drivers in the South generally drive newer cars, which is nice. This is not the case in Philly, also Detroit, and to a lesser extent, New York/New Jersey, and the Bay Area. I'm guessing it's closely related to the cost of living in these areas. The lower the cost of living, the nicer the cars.\n\nIn the end, because of this one memorable experience (for all the wrong reasons), I give Lyft in Philadelphia 2 stars: \"Meh.

It was a vegetarian buffet, a first for me at a wedding reception (and I've been to a lot). I'm not a big fan of vegetarian food (as a meal), so I think it's pretty impressive that Chef's Table was able to cater a spread of vegetarian food that I thought was quite good. Some items, in particular, were fantastic.\n\nThe cocktail hour took place at the ceremony site, Chinese Christian Church and Center in Chinatown North/Callowhill (Vine Campus) (https://www.yelp.com/biz/chinese-christian-church-and-center-philadelphia). Chef's Table set up a bar with two bartenders and a small self-serve buffet of hors d'oeuvres just inside the entrance of the sanctuary.\n\nCocktail hour menu:\n* Antipasto tray - soppressata, pepperoni, sharp Provolone, Italian Fontina, grilled artichoke hearts, marinated olives, button mushrooms, and artichoke hearts\n* Crudite tray - assorted raw and blanched vegetables\n* Mezza tray - stuffed grape leaves and green olives with lemon and coriander, hummus, baba ghanoush, muhammara\n\nI thought the spread of hors d'oeuvres was great. The foods were very fresh and healthy. I like eating raw veggies and appreciated the variety that included not only standard veggies like broccoli and grape tomatoes, but also endives and beets. The stuffed grape leaves were scrumptious, but the star of the show was the muhammara. Muhammara is a Middle Eastern red pepper and walnut spread. Chef's Table's version was delicious, full of flavor, with an appetizing, almost creamy, consistency.\n\nThe dinner reception took place down the street at the Asian Arts Initiative (https://www.yelp.com/biz/asian-arts-initiative-philadelphia). Chef's Table once again had a two-man bar plus four self-serve dinner stations set up and spread out along the perimeter of the venue.\n\nDinner reception menu:\n\nPasta station\n* Roasted stone fruit salad - arugula and mixed greens, mango vinaigrette\n* Rigatoni with fresh pomodoro sauce - balsamic caramelized onions\n* Penne primavera - garlic and olive oil with garden vegetables\n\nJackfruit \"crab\" cake station\n* Sauteed spinach\n* Pakora potato cake - peas and cauliflower\n\nMiddle East station\n* Moroccan braised seitan - tomatoes, zucchini, yellow squash, peppers, onions, golden raisins, and chickpeas over jasmine rice\n* Cajun-spiced butternut squash - tomato caper\n\nDessert station\n* Almond pistachio baklava\n* Fruit tarts\n* Cardamom apple crumb cakes\n\nBar menu\n* Beer - Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA, Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy, Yuengling, Corona, Shock Top\n* Wine - Pinot Noir, red blend, Malbec, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, rose\n* Spirits - rum, vodka, whiskey, gin, tequila\n* \"First Sunset\" cocktail - orange juice, rum, grenadine, lime slice\n\nDrink station\n* Fresh coffee\n* Decaf coffee\n* Half and half, almond milk\n* Hot water - assorted teas\n\nMy favorite dish, without a doubt, was the roasted stone fruit salad. I got that dish three times because the peaches were ripe and incredibly juicy and sweet. So good. I also like arugula and greens, so it was a nice combination. The most memorable dish to me was the jackfruit \"crab\" cake. I'm allergic to crab, so I enjoyed being able to eat this version of \"crab\" cake. The use of ingredients like jackfruit and offering menu items like muhammara, Moroccan braised seitan, and baklava really showed off the breadth of Chef's Table's offerings. I thought the bride did a wonderful job choosing a menu that was diverse and showed off a number of cuisines from around the world. My second favorite dish was the collection of desserts, all three. They were terrific, high quality. Everything was presented nicely. Overall, I found the dinner menu to be creative, unique, and tasty.\n\nThe two bartenders were polite and friendly. As an out-of-town guest, they definitely didn't seem like the stereotypical Philadelphians to me. They were warm and hospitable, both at cocktail hour and at the reception.

Kennedy Plaza or Love Park: https://www.yelp.com/biz/love-park-philadelphia) and the Philadelphia Museum of Art (https://www.yelp.com/biz/philadelphia-museum-of-art-philadelphia).\n\nThe Parkway is wide and scenic. It was modeled after the Champs-Elysees in Paris. Unlike the Champs-Elysees, however, Benjamin Franklin Parkway isn't lined with as many buildings, but instead more trees. Many parks and fountains are situated on the Parkway's path, from Love Park to Eakins Oval. Along with parks and fountains, there are several museums and other sights and attractions along the Parkway. They include the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul, Logan Circle (a.k.a. Logan Square), the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University, the Franklin Institute, and the Rodin Museum. The latter is home to a historic statue, The Thinker. This part of town is officially known as the Parkway Museums District.\n\nIf you're sightseeing in Philly for the first time, I suggest starting at City Hall (https://www.yelp.com/biz/city-hall-philadelphia). The midpoint of the Parkway is the aforementioned Logan Circle (https://www.yelp.com/biz/logan-circle-philadelphia-2), home of the beautiful Swann Memorial Fountain (https://www.yelp.com/biz/swann-memorial-fountain-philadelphia-2). The stretch of parkway between Logan Circle and the Philadelphia Museum of Art is lined with flags of countries from all over the world. Not every country is represented. According to the city's Parkway Council Foundation, the flags represented are those \"with significant populations in Philadelphia\" (http://www.parkwaymuseumsdistrictphiladelphia.org/About-the-Parkway/FAQs/25/#q5).\n\nGrowing up, I was first introduced to Benjamin Franklin Parkway, unknowingly, through the Rocky movies. Rocky II (1979) in particular highlights the Parkway with Sylvester Stallone running with a bunch of kids around Swann Memorial Fountain (Logan Circle) and then up the Parkway, past The Thinker (Rodin Museum) and Washington Monument (Eakins Oval), and up the famous art museum steps: https://youtu.be/ABg0c_E7OOI?t=282.

It's a pedestrian-only alleyway lined with colonial-era homes; 32 to be exact. Walking on the short street is like taking a trip back in time. The alley is located on the east side of Center City, near the Ben Franklin Bridge, Delaware River, and Pennsylvania-New Jersey border. It's a National Historic Landmark.\n\nWe visited around 5pm on a Sunday and the alley wasn't crowded at all. At times, my fiancee and I were the only ones there. Somewhat to my surprise, our Lyft driver, who has lived in Philly for a number of years, had never heard of Elfreth's Alley before. It's a cobblestone street, originally designed to be a cart path to the river. The multistory brick homes are quaint and well-maintained. The homes were originally occupied by shopkeepers and merchants who operated businesses out of their homes.\n\nAccording to a plaque posted in the alley, the alley dates back to 1736. The Elfreth's Alley Association describes this as the nation's oldest residential street even though New York's Huguenot Street was settled in the 1600s and has been continuously inhabited.\n\nTwo of the 32 homes are used today as a museum and gift shop. The museum is furnished as it would have been in 1760. At the time of writing this review, the museum is open April-October, Friday-Sunday, 12pm-5pm. Admission is cheap: only $3 per adult, $2 per child aged 5-12, and free for children under 5. However, walking the alley is completely free and it's \"open\" 24/7. The other 29 homes are private residences that are still in use today.\n\nIn December 2018, Curbed reported that an end unit was for sale and the asking price was $925,000 (https://philly.curbed.com/2018/12/10/18134400/elfreths-alley-philly-home-house-historic-sale-1700s). In February 2019, Philadelphia Magazine reported on the same house at 139 Elfreth's Alley.

We came away from Philly with a different impression of the city than before we visited. The people were nicer, the city was cleaner, and there was more to see and do than either of us expected.\n\nBefore we visited Philly, multiple people gave us negative or \"meh\" opinions of the place. It's dirty. There's not much to see. Some went as far to say it's a s***hole (even from someone who used to live here). Also, as a sports fan, I know Philly fans have a reputation as being some of the rudest and most obnoxious fans around. We didn't attend any sporting events, but the locals we interacted with at the hotels we stayed at, the restaurants we dined at, the rideshares we rode in, and the venues we visited were mostly kind and friendly, sometimes exceptionally so. This was the case both in the city and out in the suburbs (Plymouth Meeting). We did run into a couple bad apples (cashier at Tea Do in Chinatown and one Lyft driver), but they were the exception, not the rule.\n\nAs far as stuff to see and do, there was plenty. Philly is like a mini New York or a mini Manhattan. Here, I'll count down my top 10 highlights/favorite things we did in Philly. Our friends, who are locals, as well as wedding guests we met, who are also locals, and another friend of mine, who used to be a local Yelp Elite, recommended most of these spots to us.

At a minimum, it takes hours to explore, but can easily take days if you visit the Anne d'Harnoncourt Sculpture Garden behind the main building, the nearby Perelman Building (photography, fashion, textiles, contemporary design) and Rodin Museum (about 150 sculptures by Auguste Rodin, including The Thinker out front), and two historic houses, Cedar Grove and Mount Pleasant. All are owned by the city.\n\nAt the time of writing this review, two-day general admission allows you access to all of the above buildings and costs:\n\n$20 for adults (age 19+)\n$18 for seniors (age 65+)\n$14 for students and youth (valid with student ID or age 13-18)\nFree for kids (age 12 and under)\n\nOn the first Sunday of every month, 10am-5pm, and every Wednesday, 5-8:45pm, admission is \"pay what you wish.\" The main building is open six days a week, typically closed every Monday, but open most holidays like Memorial Day and Labor Day. Along with being open Wednesday nights for \"pay what you wish,\" the main building is also open on Friday nights for live music and drinks. Parking at the main building's on-site garage is only $5 on Wednesday and Friday nights with validation from the Visitor Services desk.\n\nThe standard parking rate is $12 for the first four hours plus $2 for each additional hour. The entrance to the parking deck is located on Anne d'Harnoncourt Drive, close to Kelly Drive. Follow the signs.\n\nThe museum is one of the largest and most visited in the world. The main building itself is gargantuan and a work of art. It looks like a grand and magnificent Greek temple with towering columns, majestic fountains, and manicured gardens. While the main building opened in 1928, it's probably best known for its appearances in the Rocky movies beginning in 1976. Since then, the wide stairway leading up to the front of the museum has been known as the Rocky Steps (https://www.yelp.com/biz/rocky-steps-philadelphia). The popular Rocky Statue (https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-rocky-statue-philadelphia) is located at the base of the stairs, off to the right (if facing the museum).\n\nAt the end of Rocky V (1990), Sylvester Stallone and his son, Sage Stallone, are in front of the main building. Sylvester says to his son, \"Look at this, you know. I've been running up and down these steps for 20 years and I never knew there was valuable pictures in this building, you know.\" In response, Sage says, \"Well, you're never too old to learn something new. You're going to love Picasso,\" as they walk towards the museum (https://youtu.be/I7nWj8Q_FgI). The museum houses over a quarter-million pieces of art from Asia to Europe, Impressionist to Renaissance; there are hundreds of galleries spanning thousands of years. Some of the more well-known artists whose work is on display include the aforementioned Pablo Picasso, Marcel Duchamp (this is home to the largest Duchamp collection in the world), Salvador Dali, and Vincent van Gogh.\n\nIf you have time, walk around to the west side of the building.

The Backyard Axe Throwing League, also known as BATL, is a chain of axe throwing facilities that originated in Toronto. They started in 2006. I'm not sure when this BATL location opened in Nashville, but I think it's fairly new.\n\nThis was my 3rd axe throwing experience. All have been at different businesses. Each business has had its pros and cons. So far, I think BATL has been the best one I've been to. I really like their digital scoring system. Each set of throwing lanes has a big display that updates with live scoring down to which section of the target is hit. While scoring data is input manually by staff assigned to each lane, I think it's still pretty cool.\n\nIn the last year or so, axe throwing has been trending, at least in the Southeast. If you've never tried it, it's a lot of fun and great for groups. It's kind of like bowling or Topgolf, but the best comparison is darts, except instead of throwing darts, you're throwing hand axes. It sounds dangerous, but it's really not if you and your friends listen to the staff and follow the rules. Of course, you have to sign waivers. Remember to wear closed-toe shoes. No sandals/flip-flops.\n\nOur group of nine paid $38.89 per person for an approximately 2-hour session of axe throwing (it was more like 2 hours and 15 minutes). The BATL staff member assigned to our group was Hope. She was our coach. She laid out the ground rules and taught us the proper way to throw axes. She monitored our lanes the entire time we were there and kept track of scoring for us (they have a specific scoring system).\n\nThere are 2 kinds of axes you can throw here. One is the standard hand axe which is what you use most of the time. The other is a \"big f***ing axe\" (BFA) which, if I recall correctly, is used for dramatic tie breakers. Hope also let us take turns throwing the BFA after our game was over just for fun. When the BFA comes out, a loud announcement is made so other lanes hear, and your throwing lane is temporarily chained off and extended due to the axe's size. The BFA pretty much requires two hands and extra room in order to be thrown. It's significantly bigger and heavier than the regular hand axes.\n\nHope was a skookum axe throwing coach. She was almost like a drill sergeant, relentlessly encouraging us for continual improvement with what seemed like an endless amount of energy. I have to hand it to her. She did a great job. We played round-robin 1v1 matches to determine standings. Each match consisted of 3 rounds. Each round consisted of 5 throws. The top 4 in the standings eventually got bracketed into a tournament and faced off to determine who would be crowned champion.\n\nCompared to the other 2 axe throwing places I've been to, BATL comes right in the middle in terms of how difficult it was to get the axes to stick on the wooden targets. Some targets are more accepting than others. Some are more beat up and hard while others are \"fresher\" and softer. All the places I've been to periodically spray their targets with water. I suspect this is to soften the targets and make them easier to hit.\n\nBATL has a full bar serving beer (including draft and many local selections) plus liquor, a canned cocktail, and canned, poured, and bottles of wine. They serve food too.\n\nCheck available throwing times and book your reservation here: https://batlgrounds.com/axe-throwing-nashville/.

They also have specials not on the menu, one of which included a calamari starter that we ended up ordering.  Among the items I tried:\n\nCorn-fried calamari - served with spicy sauce on top of spinach\nCorn-fried Louisiana oysters - also included cole slaw and remoulade (mayonnaise-based French sauce)\nSeared duck breast - served with two slices of Louisiana alligator sausage, dirty rice, greens, and smoked sage demi-glace (rich brown French sauce)\n\nThe table also gets complimentary corn bread and French rolls.  The corn bread is served in soft, fluffy blocks.  It was some of the best corn bread I've had in a while.  The blocks were moist, delicate, and crumble in your hand.  Loved the fried oysters and they are best eaten with the slaw and remoulade at the same time.  The oysters were light and crispy.  The duck breast and alligator sausage were amazing.  The duck breast was thick yet tender and the alligator sausage was very flavorful.  They were perfect with both the greens and rice.  Everyone loved their dishes.  Check out the photos I've uploaded with this review to see what I'm talking about.\n\nAs mentioned previously, the restaurant is upscale, but has a casual atmosphere.  The tables are small.

We enjoyed it.\n\nOne of our friends, who currently lives in Philly, brought us here. It was a good choice. Another one of our friends, who used to live in Philly, considers this Philly's first \"legit\" bubble tea place. It opened in 2012. It's located in Chinatown, just one block north of Friendship Gate: https://www.yelp.com/biz/chinatown-friendship-gate-philadelphia.\n\nOutside, the corner storefront has a cool mural of a dragon. Inside, the place was packed. Almost every seat was taken - and this was on a Sunday night around 8:10pm. Like a lot of bubble tea shops, Tea Do isn't big, but it does have seating. There are a handful of high tables and low/coffee tables. Several years old now, there's nothing too remarkable about the interior.\n\nThe menu is sizable with over 76 drinks to choose from. They include Tea Do specialties (special drinks unique to this brand), smoothies, milk bubble tea, popping bubble drinks, green tea drinks, black tea drinks, and aloe vera drinks. All drinks come in regular and large sizes. Most specialties and smoothies run $4.25 each for regular and $5.25 each for large, milk teas $3.50 regular / $4.50 large, and other drinks $3.75 regular / $4.75 large. There are 17 topping options and 16 of them cost $0.50 each (white pearl jelly is $0.75).\n\nIn addition to the regular menu, there was a blackboard menu on the counter. During our visit, it advertised Tiger milk tea, winter melon green tea, Johnny tea, and chrysanthemum tea plus apple and yogurt popping boba and almond milk substitute. There was no description of the Tiger and Johnny teas, so you'd have to ask the staff.\n\nI tried three drinks:\n\n* Grasshopper (large, $5.25)\n* Taro bubble milk tea (large, $4.50)\n* Oolong bubble milk tea (regular, $3.75)\n\nI enjoyed all the drinks and would recommend all three of them. Across the board, I thought the tea and topping quality was good. Good tea flavor and fresh, appetizing toppings with ideal textures.\n\nThe Grasshopper was different than what I'm used to (I usually order milk bubble teas). The Grasshopper is made with green tea, green apple, pear, green tea jelly, and lychee jelly. The drink was mildly sweet, a little bit tart, ice cold, and very refreshing. It hit the spot for me. I think my fiancee liked it the best of the drinks we ordered.\n\nThe taro bubble milk tea and the oolong bubble milk tea were both solid. No complaints here. Both drinks had a smooth, non-powdery consistency with nice flavor and ideal sweetness (for me). The boba was excellent; soft and delectably chewy.\n\nService was fine. The apathetic cashier could've been friendlier. He didn't have a great attitude. If we didn't tell him what size we wanted our drinks, he would've made them all large. He didn't ask us what sizes we wanted. Our order was filled quick.\n\nAccording to Tea Do's website, this location in Philly is the first location.

Why can't all Mediterranean and Middle Eastern restaurants be this good? Dizengoff is an Israeli restaurant with *the* best hummus I've had to date, anywhere, and probably the best pita too. This place is simply outstanding. Stop reading and go. Now. (After writing over 3,400 Yelp reviews over the past 11+ years, I've never written that before.)\n\nThis is a small fast-casual restaurant that opened in Center City in 2014. A second location opened inside the Whole Foods behind the Rodin Museum in 2016. It's named after Dizengoff Street, a major street in Tel Aviv (the street, in turn, is named after the first mayor of Tel Aviv).\n\nWe showed up on a Saturday around 12:45pm. All seats inside were taken. Then again, there are only about 15-20 seats inside. We got lucky and scored some seats at the communal table shortly after placing our order. The line to order was short, but there was a steady stream of customers the entire time we were there (we left by 1:30pm). Staff keeps the line moving. This place is popular and does good business. It's a well-oiled machine. There are four small umbrella-covered tables outside on the sidewalk, but the weather was so hot that no one was sitting at them.\n\nThis is a trendy spot with a sort of hipstery vibe. Dizengoff's logo is bright pink and the front door frame and patio furniture are a bold orange color. The storefront has a retractable door that presumably cranks open when the weather is nice. Inside, there's an open kitchen featuring a Wood Stove brand oven where all the fresh, scratch-made pitas are baked.\n\nThe menu is short and simple. They serve hummus in five different varieties/toppings -- tehina, chicken, pepper, cucumber, and cauliflower -- priced at $10-13 each. All menu prices include tax. I think the food is affordable especially when you consider its quality and deliciousness. Each order of hummus includes fresh-baked pita and two sides, one of which is a Jerusalem salad with pickle, and the other a surprise (well, to us they were). Most Mediterranean and Middle Eastern restaurants serve hummus as an appetizer or side, but here it's an entree and it's good.\n\nYou can make small additions to any hummus order such as extra pita ($1), egg ($1), and pita chips ($3) and you can add any topping on the side. In addition, they offer Za'atar roasted chicken dinners to-go ($36) and shakshuka, a North African dish made with eggs poached in a tomato-chili pepper sauce, on Sundays. Alcoholic beverages (beer, white wine, rose) are available for $4-8 each and they sell a frozen lemonana synonymous to, I think, the Middle Eastern limonana drink which is a frozen mint lemonade ($4 without booze, $8 with). Happy hour runs daily, 6-8pm.\n\nWe ordered one hummus with tehina and egg ($10 + $1 = $11) and one hummus with chicken ($13). Both orders were phenomenal. Along with the pita and Jerusalem salads with pickles mentioned above, the hummus with tehina and egg came with a marinated cucumber side salad and the hummus with chicken came with a roasted red pepper side salad. We noticed these sides were the same as the \"cucumber\" and \"pepper\" hummus toppings listed on the menu. I'm not sure how they decided which ones we'd get (they didn't ask us), but we liked the variety and enjoyed them both. They were flavorful and delicious.\n\nEach order was served on its on tray. The arrangement of the dishes and the presentation of each individual dish was colorful and beautiful. The food tasted as good as it looked: excellent all around. Everything tasted incredibly fresh and high quality. The hummus was super smooth, creamy, and delectable. It had an extra bit of tehina (same as tahini or toasted ground sesame seeds) flavor. Both the hummus with tehina and egg and the hummus with chicken were nicely seasoned and packed with mouthwatering flavor. The jammy soft-boiled egg was cooked perfectly. The chicken was tasty; it didn't overpower the hummus and complemented it well. The pita was served hot/warm, each serving in its own paper sleeve. The pita had exited the oven just minutes (seconds?) before being served to us. They were soft and pillowy and were appetizingly charred/toasted on the outside. So good.\n\nI also had a frozen lemonana ($4). It was tart and refreshing. I think it's worth getting and perfect for hot summer days.

Yes, I love Rocky that much. The movies are entertaining, nostalgic, and inspirational and the music, especially the songs by Bill Conti, are iconic and some of the absolute best in cinematic history (and in all of music, in my opinion).\n\nAt the time of writing this review, the Rocky Statue is located at the bottom of the famous Rocky Steps at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. If facing the front of the museum, the statue is located off to the right in a special fenced-in area. It's funny. There are several historic statues, fountains, and buildings/museums in the area, but the most popular one is from pop culture: the Rocky Statue.\n\nWe visited the statue on a Sunday around 3pm. It was obvious where the statue was because there was a line for it (there wasn't a line for anything else in the vicinity). \"Admission\" is free. You just have to wait in line if you want to get an up-close look and/or take a picture with the statue. When we visited, there was an employee, who looked like he worked for the museum, manning the statue area. I think he was there to keep the line in order and moving. However, the line did a good job of regulating itself. I'm glad he was there though, just in case. We entered the line at 3:07pm and I got my picture snapped with the statue at 3:22pm, so we waited a total of 15 minutes. Not bad.\n\nRocky fans might remember the statue's unveiling in Rocky III (1983): https://youtu.be/hxnifQ7EdxY. Actually, three statues were cast in the early 80s, originally commissioned by Sylvester Stallone in 1980. The statue at the art museum was the one used in the movie, donated to the City of Philadelphia by Stallone. The statue bounced around the city over the years before returning to the art museum in 2006, coincident with the release of Rocky Balboa (2006).\n\nThe statue is bronze and stands 8 feet, 6 inches tall. The brick and concrete base has a plaque with a quote from a powerful scene in that movie (https://youtu.be/mk82j1jQw_8). The plaque reads:\n\n\"ROCKY BALBOA\n\nIt's not how hard you hit, it's how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done.\n\nThis statue is dedicated to the great city of Philadelphia and the brotherhood of its people.\n\nSylvester Stallone\n2006\"\n\nIt was awesome to see the statue in person and an honor to take a picture with it. The public outdoor space the museum set aside for the statue is clean, well-maintained, and landscaped. It was nicer than I expected.\n\nThere were Rocky lookalikes hanging out around the statue and steps. I happened to run into two that I know and met years ago at Dragon Con in Atlanta: @lonstermash and @thelordhumungus (on Instagram). What a small world.

The AAI is located in Philadelphia's Chinatown North (Callowhill) neighborhood, attached to a Best Western Plus which was perfect for wedding guests. The center sits on Vine which parallels I-676. It has nice views of the downtown Philly skyline to east and south, especially from the top floor.\n\nThe AAI is a nonprofit organization. It serves as a community center with an art gallery, workshops, meeting spaces, and theater. The art gallery is located on the first floor and is open weekdays, 10am-6pm. The organization is inclusive, works to promote racial equity, and encourages discourse about the Asian-American experience.\n\nLike many buildings in Center City, the AAI building is old and creaky. There are both stairs and an elevator. The stairwell on the lower level had a funky, sewer-like smell. The stairwell had cool, colorful murals.\n\nThe wedding reception took over pretty much the entire third floor space. The open layout had all-white walls and wood (or wood laminate) flooring. The ceiling was decorated in string lights, there was ambient blue and purple lighting up some of the walls, and six windows provided views facing south towards city skyscrapers. There were white tablecloths, candles and flowers, white folding chairs, bar and catering stations set up along the perimeter by Chef's Table Catering of Philadelphia (https://www.yelp.com/biz/chefs-table-catering-philadelphia), a DJ, sound and lighting system, and photo booth.\n\nThe ductwork was exposed and generally, the room had a sort of loft or factory feel to it. The reception went off without a hitch. Dinner flowed well, sound was good for mics and music, and lighting was dimmed/turned off for dancing. The reception ran from 6pm to 9pm. During this time, the front door to the center, which otherwise would have been closed, was open. There was a lady stationed at the front desk and she was helpful. The floor was a little warm. I'm not sure if the AC was working or not.\n\nThere were two restrooms. At this event, they were designated one per sex though I think normally, they're gender-neutral.

With several escape room rookies on our team of six, we still managed to beat the room in only 42 minutes 11 seconds (17 minutes 49 seconds left on the clock). I thought that was impressive considering this room was rated a \"7/10\" difficulty by the company.\n\nThe Escape Game is an escape room chain with several locations around the country including Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Minneapolis, and Orlando. There are two locations in Nashville: (1) the Berry Hill location in South Nashville which opened in 2014 and (2) this newer location in downtown Nashville which opened in 2015.\n\nSurface lot parking is available adjacent to this location, but it's not free. We took Uber, but we should have taken Lyft because The Escape Game partnered with Lyft to offer discounts. If you've never used Lyft before, you can visit this link, https://www.lyft.com/invite/escapedt, or download the app and enter code EscapeDT to get $5 off your ride to or from The Escape Game. If you already have Lyft, you can enter code TEG10 on the app and save 10% on your ride to or from The Escape Game.\n\nCurrently, this location offers four rooms:\n\n* Gold Rush - 2-7 players, 7/10 difficulty\n* The Heist - 2-8 players, 8/10 difficulty\n* Nashville - 2-7 players, 7/10 difficulty\n* Prison Break - 2-8 players, 9/10 difficulty\n\nIf you've never played an escape room game before, they're a lot of fun. You get \"locked\" in a room and have 60 minutes to escape. You're really not locked in case there's an emergency; it's just for fun. You have to solve clues and riddles and uncover secrets in order to escape. It's a lot like playing one of those old-school point-and-click adventure games on a computer, except these are actual mocked-up rooms with props and working gadgets. If you get stuck, you can ask for up to three hints from your \"game master,\" an employee of The Escape Game who watches you and your team via closed-circuit video.\n\nWe chose the Nashville room because 5/6 of us were visiting Nashville from out of town, so we wanted to get the full Music City experience.\n\nThe Nashville room was the 55th escape room I've played since I started playing escape rooms in 2014. So, I have a lot of rooms to compare Nashville to. Honestly, over the years, a lot of the rooms have started blending together for me. Generally speaking, I thought the Nashville room was solidly built. The quality of the construction and the props were good to very good. The room is made to look like a music producer's office and music studio, so there are musical instruments, speakers and sound equipment, a recording booth, and more. It's pretty cool. As far as the game design, I thought the clues and riddles were fair and they flowed well. There was a decent story and objective: you and your teammates are a band who have to find the producer's one last contract.\n\nOut of the dozens of rooms I've played, I give credit to the Nashville room for being unique. It's the first and so far only music-themed escape room I've played. A couple other rooms here, The Heist and Prison Break, are more generic. Other escape room companies offer similar-themed rooms. Nashville is one-of-a-kind in this regard. Aside from that, nothing about the Nashville experience made it stand out from many of the other rooms I've done. For example, there was no memorable, ingenious puzzle or some sort of dramatic or unforgettable moment. It was simply a fun room, which in my experience, most escape rooms are.\n\nThe Escape Game Nashville's rate is $31.99 plus tax per person to play one room. This worked out to be $35 per person for our group. To date, it's the most expensive escape room I've played. I've paid $30 and up for several rooms, but the majority I've played have been under $30 whether it be a business' regular rate or a discounted rate through something like Groupon. At the time of writing this review, I've paid an average of $20.15 per room for 56 rooms including this one. Most of the rooms have been in metro Atlanta: https://www.yelp.com/collection/n0eJ13G2Zc8qBxAZB9Mm0w.\n\nIf you don't fully book all slots in a room, there's a chance you'll be teamed up with someone you don't know. For example, the 6 of us booked the Nashville room which can accommodate up to 7, so there was a chance a random person could have joined us to fill the last slot. Just something to keep in mind.\n\nApart from the high price when compared to other escape room games, I did find The Escape Game Nashville to be enjoyable and recommend it for any group (friends, family, coworkers) looking for a fun activity to do.

This is a relatively new New American restaurant and bar (opened September 2016) that is located just two blocks south of Logan Circle (a.k.a. Logan Square). The name is fitting because it's named after James Logan, the 14th mayor of Philadelphia. It's a modern take on American fare with an elevated tavern atmosphere.\n\nThis is a nice-looking, spacious restaurant with a sizable bar and both indoor and outdoor seating. Outdoor seating consists of umbrella-covered tables on the sidewalk. The interior has an assortment of booths, tables, high-tops, and TVs. This place works just as well for groups as it does one-on-one dates. Refined yet casual is a good way to describe the environment.\n\nBrunch is served Saturday and Sunday, 11am-3pm. A bar menu (food) is offered daily, 3-5pm. Most brunch plates run $13-20 each. Expect to spend about $9-13 each for soups and salads and $16-18 each on sandwiches and burgers, all day. Dinner entrees will set you back $22-27 each. So, this isn't a cheap restaurant, but it's not very expensive either.\n\nWe were part of a large brunch party (about 20-30 of us) and a special preset menu was prepared for us. We took up three tables in the dining room. The menu was three courses:\n\nFirst Course\n* Individual fruit salads - seasonal fruit, berries, mint\n\nSecond Course (choice of)\n* Frittata - spinach, mozzarella, artichokes\n* James French toast - vanilla, cinnamon, whipped cream, maple syrup\n* Brunch burger - ground short rib and brisket, Taylor pork roll, Cabot cheddar, sunny-side-up egg\n\nDessert (choice of)\n* Apple pie\n* Chocolate cake\n(Perhaps more choices, I forget...)\n\nIn general, I thought the food was fine. No complaints. Everything was plated and presented nicely.\n\nThe \"seasonal\" fruit in the individual fruit salads consisted of watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew, pineapple, strawberry, and blackberry. All of the fruits were ripe and fresh, comparable to a fruit salad one can get at a grocery store. I liked this light and healthy option. However, from a sit-down restaurant, I expected some creativity or something unique to set it apart from being essentially a plain fruit salad.\n\nOf the second course options, I tried two: the frittata and James French toast. Both were good. These dishes were a little on the heavier side, particularly the French toast which was like a dessert. The French toast was prepared with challah bread, I believe. The consistency was somewhat dense. Not among the best French toast I've had, but not bad either. I liked the frittata better, but it could have used an extra ingredient like meat or something. Again, not bad. The frittata came with a side of chopped skillet potatoes, peppers, and onions. We asked for a side of ketchup to go with those.\n\nFor dessert, I tried both the apple pie and chocolate cake. The desserts looked wonderful. The apple pie was yummy, but it was fairly dense and cold, like it had just been removed from the fridge. Same with the chocolate cake. The chocolate cake was super rich. While tasty, I could only take a few bites of it. Same for my friends.\n\nFor drinks, I had both an OJ and iced coffee. The glass of OJ came with a slice of orange which was a nice little touch. The drinks were par for the course.\n\nService was great. There were at least a couple servers working our large group and they were polite and attentive.\n\nIn the end, I found our meal here to be satisfactory. While the food wasn't amazing nor memorable, I still thought it was decent and sufficed for what it was (brunch). I liked the design of the restaurant, inside and out, and the service was on point.

If you've never been to Philly before, I recommend checking it out. It's located in the center and is the highlight of Logan Circle (https://www.yelp.com/biz/logan-circle-philadelphia-2) a.k.a. Logan Square, the midpoint of the scenic and wide Benjamin Franklin Parkway (https://www.yelp.com/biz/ben-franklin-parkway-philadelphia). The fountain opened in 1924 and is named after Dr. Wilson Cary Swann, founder of the Philadelphia Fountain Society. The society provided sources of fresh drinking water for the city.\n\nMy fiancee and I visited this fountain on a sunny and hot Sunday afternoon after having brunch at the nearby James Restaurant & Bar (https://www.yelp.com/biz/james-restaurant-and-bar-philadelphia). The fountain and surrounding park were filled with both locals and tourists; a popular spot for sure. There were lots of families and many children swimming and playing in the fountain despite there being signs that said no swimming was allowed. What's up with that?\n\nThis fountain reminds me of Buckingham Fountain in Chicago (https://www.yelp.com/biz/buckingham-fountain-chicago) due to its vintage, size, design, and art style. Buckingham Fountain opened in 1927, is huge, and was designed in art deco style, all very similar or the same as this fountain. Both fountains have multiple spouts that spew water way up high. Buckingham's center spout shoots water as high as 150 feet, while Swann's center spout shoots \"only\" as high as 50 feet. Buckingham has sea horse water jets while Swann has frogs, turtles, fish, and swan jets. Buckingham has water shows, but Swann does not. Apparently, people swim in the Swann, but not in the Buckingham.\n\nStatues of Native Americans in the center of the fountain represent three nearby waterways: the Delaware River (man), Schuylkill River (woman), and Wissahickon Creek (girl). The man who designed this fountain, Alexander Stirling Calder, is the son of Alexander Milne Calder, who designed the statue of William Penn which sits atop City Hall.\n\nThis is a scenic spot and it's great for taking photos. The fountain is mostly bright blue, there are several spouts/jets of water, and you have a nice 360-degree view of the city, from City Hall to the south to the Philadelphia Museum of Art to the north. There are many sights and attractions nearby. For sightseers, I recommend walking the entire length of Benjamin Franklin Parkway (the aforementioned city hall and museum are the termini).

Pulling up to this unassuming and intimate restaurant right next to a Vons, you'll find a dim-lit and charming interior boasting incredibly creative sushi with picture-perfect presentations. \n\nLike Nicolette Sheridan, this is what we call a sure thing.\n\nFirst, the menu is huge. If you're a strict traditionalist then you'll be disappointed since their spin on sushi is quite novel; combining fish, textures and flavors in ways I had never before seen. We ordered the Surfer's roll...twice...maybe three times because every time it hit the table everyone began using their chopsticks as weapons of war. We went on to devour the Red Dragon and Montecito rolls with impatient precision. The ahi tuna appetizer is also worth noting. The sushi is served in press box form so you won't find any seaweed holding things together or impacting the overall taste. Every dish is positioned like artwork with splashes of colorful sauces striped across and as you eat and dip the image on the plate transforms. \n\nIt's not cheap but it's also completely worth the price tag.

We took the St. Charles Street Car and walked the few blocks to the restaurant.  The blue and white awning on the bluish color converted home has an inviting, Southern appeal to it.  Commander's is a dining experience not to be missed. \n\nBefore our visit to New Orleans, we made reservations for 12:30 on a Saturday which worked out to be a Jazz Brunch which was a sort of prix fix meal with a beverage, a soup or salad, an entree, and dessert.  A jazz band wandered through the restaurant as we ate and played some nice jazz music that wasn't too loud, and created a nice ambiance. \n\nThis is not your run-of-the-mill restaurant.  You have to dress-up in nicer clothes--no shorts are allowed.  I wore stuff that I would wear to work, but did notice that there were some younger folks that were wearing golf/polo shirts. \n\nHere are the selections that I made with the Jazz brunch:\n\n-  Commander's Palace Bloody Mary with the southern twist of pickled okra, and topped off tableside with Finlandia vodka\n-  Gumbo -- with oysters, shrimp\n-  Eggs Cochon au Lait -  A sage buttermilk biscuit, \"debris\" pork, poached eggs with cracklin hollandaise sauce \n-  Creole Bread pudding souffle with warm whiskey sauce\n\nI have to say everything was perfect.  Everything that was put in front of me, I devoured, and happily.  I was amazed at how they chose flavors that I never considered together, and it worked so perfectly.  \n\nNow, to the piece de resistance of Commander's:  the service.  I have never in my life received such wonderful, almost perfect service.  They gave us adequate time to make selections, made suggestions when asked, made sure that we received each course of our meal at the same time--I mean exact, same time, and I would say that the room's six or seven servers each visited our table in some sort of way.  Commander's has this down to an art form, and it a wonderful thing to witness.  I even left the table for a moment to use the restroom, and when I returned, they had taken away my old napkin, and replaced it with a brand new one.  Attention to detail!  \n\nThis was a dining experience and very worthwhile to try when visiting New Orleans.

The hotel's location is nice so that you don't have to deal with the noise of the Quarter, and the drunks sharing the contents of their drinking adventures on your hotel's front step. \n\nWe had a room on the 11th floor, and it was your basic hotel room, but looked like it had been at least updated recently.  There was a two-room bathroom:  one with the tub and the toilet, and another with the sink.  This is nice so that one person can take care of their business in one room, while the other uses the other.  As other Yelpers indicated, the prices in the mini-bar are outrageous, and a large bottle of Evian was a whopping $7!  Damn!  I just grabbed a bottle of water when I was in the Quarter from Walgreen's and lugged it back to our room. \n\nI didn't have the issue with the elevators when I was there.  In fact, when we pressed the button for the elevator it was there with a few seconds.   Maybe things had been fixed?  I don't know. \n\nI'm docking one star from the review because the check-in times are a bit odd and start at 4pm rather than the traditional 3pm.  I know that this is a result of having a 12 o'clock noon check-out time, but if you've flown 2000 miles across the country, and get to the hotel around 3, it would have been really nice if our room was available to relax.\n\nThe rooftop pool is nice, and open until 10pm each day.

FIT.  \n\nI walked out with two hats that are quite fashionable and while I spent more than I would normally on a hat (they were $55 a pop) I saw them as investment pieces that I know I'll use for years to come.

They had a band outside that entertains you while you wait, and they sometimes even pass out instruments for you to play along with! The music took me right to the New Orleans Square in Disneyland (closest thing I've been to the real place). :)\n\nAfter we were seated, we were served some warm cornbread muffins with all sorts of different flavors (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/edJoBsse6nsF0BYh6pATAg?select=vQ-V9CfzT5e9aWoZx32jOg). Good, but not mind-blowing. I tried some of the cajun martini, which was really interesting. It's marinated with jalepenos, which makes it spicy!

We then ordered our food, and I had a hard time deciding between the jambalaya  and the paneed veal acadiana, but ended up going with the latter since everyone else seemed to be ordering jambalaya. It was basically fettuccine topped with veal medallions and crawfish. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/edJoBsse6nsF0BYh6pATAg?select=_Ues0mzPY88ObCR3STU9TA) The crawfish was really good! The veal was decent, but not that flavorful or tender. The alfredo sauce was really creamy but a little bland as well. The oyster sherry cream sauce was good though. I'd give it a 3.5. The jambalaya was pretty good, both the dirty rice and the penne version (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/edJoBsse6nsF0BYh6pATAg?select=xYB4vwPiFhxMHS0ctdpTig). And word of advice to the guys, you might want to order \"huge\" because the boys in our group ordered \"large,\" which is actually a pretty standard size and they were still a little hungry.\n\nThe 2 things that really stood out though was the dessert and the atmosphere. For dessert, try the Louisiana Bread Pudding Souffle. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/edJoBsse6nsF0BYh6pATAg?select=7GAUV8Yz1YIIkIhxI8S4xQ) It was sooo good! We tried both the chocolate souffle and the bread pudding one, but I liked the bread pudding one a lot better. It came out hot with a cool Grand Marnier whiskey cream sauce that you pour over it, and it was the perfect blend of hot and cold and sweet! As for the atmosphere, it was great!

From my favorite Starwood property (the W South Beach) to one I've bookmarked for a future visit (W Paris!), I don't ever feel like I'm chancing satisfaction with the W brand. It's a solid marriage of consistency and that inimitable jet-set meets kitschy W 'glamour'... and when you return to home base at the end of an evening, the opportunity for more trouble always awaits in the lobby bar. \n\nI haven't experienced a blip in consistency among W's until my recent stay in New Orleans. While I understand it's an older hotel (built in 1984), the years of hard partying haven't been good to ol' girl and it shows. Especially in the bathroom, where tile gets grubby and bath time feels only utilitarian. The location suits me (a few blocks away from the Quarter so it's a bit quieter) and the staff is super accommodating, but I just couldn't reconcile the mediocrity of my room with the price.\n\nWhile this hotel certainly gets the 'job' done - a good night's rest - the discrepancies between the posh lobby, outdated rooms and the inflated prices just don't add up to satisfaction.

Two seconds later, my cousin admitted he didn't care for the beer as he's 'not into hops.' Hops? What? My beloved Tank 7 is a saison. As in, low in IBUs (international bitterness units).

That, it's not.\n\nI decided to get to the bottom of things and without seeing the bottom of the pint glass, instantly realized my brother received either the wrong pour or maybe the keg had just been switched and we were tasting the previously-parked beer. In any case, my brother informed the bartender and she tried the beer. She then had the other bartender try the beer. After several minutes of deliberation they arrived at the conclusion that indeed, the beer did not taste like Tank 7. \"And? Can I please get another beer since it isn't what I asked for?\" Long pause. \"I'll have to talk to the manager to see if it can be taken off your bill.\"\n\nJust get the kid a beer.

She asked us what we wanted to drink, but being that Copia is a wine bar, kind of difficult to do that without a wine and/or drink list in front of us.

Luckily, before I left, I had found out about this place on the Tampa talk threads. From what I can tell, you need a car to get here.\n\nI agree with much of what has been said: come here early (parking is rough and food runs out), bring plenty of cash, and plan to grab some small items to eat while you stand in line for the noodle soup. I missed out on the noodle soup because of poor planning. Do not let this happen to you. Also, come with people that like to eat and understand waiting in line for food.\n\nFood wise, we tried various spring rolls and dumplings, beef satay, pumpkin curry, and chicken basil. Everything was great, and I'm fairly obsessed with the spring rolls. I also tried the papaya salad, and that was the only thing I did not really care for, and normally, I love it.\n\nThe grounds are idyllic, and the temple is gorgeous.

We called the manager and explained and frustration and the only thing he said was that \"I will check on it.\" He must've said something to him servers because they came out a few minutes after that and just kept giving us more chips while huffing and puffing. Of course, they did not mention that invitation to giving us chips they kept charging us guacamole charges. At the end of our meal (when the food finally came) we had about five guacamole charges! Half of us had the meal but the other half had to take it to go because it was already 9:30 PM!

My friend ordered some sort of crab souffle. \nDA BOMB!!!\nTalk about ridiculous.\nThe potatoes were brought out first with our drinks - boiled in spicy crab seasoning, they were the best little red potatoes I've ever had.\nThe combo plate was tasty and the catfish was actually breaded more lightly than I anticipated and made for a delicious \"typical\" southern plate. The oysters were just damn good.\nI tasted the crab souffle thingy and O M G! Melt in yo mouth goodness!\nI don't know that I've had better southern cookin' and I know that I never should again, unless I give up on my body and decide to just go with the big panty look for the remainder of my life, because nothing good can come of eating meals like this more than once, than a big, fat ass.\nAnd I mean that in the most respectful way.\n\nps they have a full service bar and Jack Honey drinks...What Da' hell!!

My girlfriend and I went here to have lunch one weekend and we were really disappointed by the limited menu offerings and the quality of the food after we had ordered. Sure this place is nice and clean, but just because you have a gold elephant on the wall, it doesn't make your restaurant legit Thai.\nOne of the first things that I noticed about the menu was the lack of noodle soups. Sure there are hot pot and tom yum but where's the boat noodle? That should be a simple thing to have on the menu and is usually a staple item on just about any Thai menu.\nMy girlfriend ordered the Pad Thai and while the color and flavor were present, the noodles were a shame. They were more pho noodle than typical rice stick noodle that pad thai usually is made with. This made it more soggy and not as good to eat.\nMy order of curry noodle had a brick of noodles sitting in curry sauce.  It was sad. How does one overcook a brick of pre-prepped noodles?\n\nAnyway, needless to say, 10$ per dish was not pleasing.

I went to Total Serenity yesterday for a massage, and it was a horrific experience.  I'm trying to be gentle, because the woman who took care of me seemed to be somewhat nice. However, she has absolutely NO EXPERIENCE with professional massage. I get better backrubs from my 7 year old niece.\n\nI would have to agree with one of the other people who posted before me who said that the masseuse had no technique, just straight up and down rubs.  At first, I thought this was just her way of prepping or warming up my muscles. I kept thinking to myself,\"Okay, NOW the real massage will begin!!\" LOL. Well, after saying that about 20-30 times, I knew this woman didn't know the first thing about a REAL massage. This made me mad, because my back and neck were full of stress knots.\n\nWell, the worst was yet to come.  She moved on to my legs and started doing some crazy technique that made me want to yell out in pain!!!  I get massages fairly often at other places, so I'm pretty sure she was doing it WRONG. Every person who ever massaged my calves and thighs did it in a relaxing way to get the kinks out.\n\nOn top of that, I think this woman had a BUTT FETISH!!!  LOL. I'm laughing right now, but I wasn't laughing yesterday.  As she massaged my thighs, she made sure to end each stroke with a handful of my butt.Each time, she stroked it slow and sensually, almost like she thought it was turning me on!  EWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I don't want that kind of massage from a woman!!!  It was sooo unbelievably uncomfortable.  \n\nI felt bad, because my bf gave me the massage as one of my birthday gifts, and instead of leaving the salon relaxed and refreshed, I felt even more tense and stressed from clenching my butt cheeks every time her hand grazed and caressed it. When it was over, I couldn't get to the exit FAST ENOUGH!! lol. To add insult to injury, she had the nerve to hand me an empty envelope, indicating that she was expecting to get a tip.  Well, I ended up tipping her a few dollars, because in the end, I usually DO tip people when I receive any kind of service. Trust me, I would have rather kept that money in my wallet. \n\nI understand that for some people, the butt massage is no big deal, but I would have preferred to be asked. Don't just grab it and HAVE AT IT without my permission. This experience has me so jaded, that I doubt I will ever go to a spa for a massage again. I'll stick to Massage Envy and places in the mall. They do a better job anyway and for much less money.\n\nOh, and forget about trying to get an appointment here. It took me two weeks to get mine, because no one answered the phone during business hours, and then when you leave a message, no one calls you back!\n\nDo yourself a favor, don't go to Total Serenity for a massage.

One of the things I know I'll miss about Philly is access to all of the unique cafes I've grown to love. It's nice to know I can get breakfast/brunch that's just as good as those places at the Turning Point. What a great little find.... and quite a surprise, I might add.\n\nMy fiance' and I were in NJ house-hunting when we decided to stop for brunch.  We both decided we were sick of all of our regular go-to places in the area (Silver Diner, Grand Lux, etc.) and decided to check for a place we hadn't been to yet on Yelp. Lo and behold, my fellow Yelpers have once again turned me on to a winner!  Turning Point is a great restaurant, for the most part. However, there are some not-so-great things that I need to address.\n\nWhen we walked in, we thought it was really cute and especially liked how sunny it was inside, courtesy of their sunroom ceilings.It was cozy and charming..... in the FRONT ROOMS, that is.  Unfortunately, the front room was not where we were seated.  Instead, we were led to one of their rooms in the back, where seating was cramped, the floor was wet and sticky, and there was no sun whatsoever. I have to admit, I was a little disappointed because it's such a cute restaurant. That little room in the back is definitely a downer. It's next to the kitchen, it's noisy, and you really feel secluded from the the rest of the restaurant. Normally, this would ruin my entire experience, but the Turning Point WAS able to redeem itself.  \n\nHow, you ask?  Well, the food. It's DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!   I had the OMG, which was \"dipped wheat french toast with dollops of pumpkin cinnamon mascarpone, toasted pecans, caramel drizzle and chopped Virginia smoked bacon.\" My fiance had the Huevos Rancheros, which is kind of his \"usual\" when we eat out. He said it was the best he had ever tasted, even better than Sabrina's in Philly (which is our favorite cafe for brunch).  \n\nWe also ordered fresh squeezed valencia orange juice, and I had a cup of breakfast tea.  The Turning Point also has lots of gourmet hot drinks, such as expressos, hot chocolates and loose leaf hot teas, and cold drinks, such as a variety of iced teas and coffees, smoothies and shakes, and fresh squeezed orange juice (as I said earlier) and lemonade.  \n\nSo, yeah... this is really good place to have brunch. You will definitely find something you like on their menu.  Just remember, take my advice and ask your waitress NOT to seat you in the back.

I go to this particular Walmart every once in a while, because I usually hate Walmart but found this one to be not as bad as the others. I was wrong.  It sure didn't take long for this place to become as deplorable as every other Walmart location.  \n\nI only went this time because I needed a prescription filled that my insurance doesn't cover. A friend told me that I could save money by buying it at Walmart (and I DID save $25.00).  My doctor called the prescription in at 1:00, (afternoon) and I figured if I went at 8:30 p.m., I could run in and pick it up really quickly without having to wait. Wishful thinking!!!!!!\n\nThere was a pharmacist and 2 male employees working... or should I say NOT working. The pharmacist was helping a couple in front of me.  I waited in line for 15 minutes (of which NO ONE even glanced in my direction), before I finally called out to one of the lazy employees in the back,\"Are you guys open or what?\" One of them reluctantly came to help me. He asked for my name about 5 times. I spelled it for him SIX times.  He finally tells me I'm not in the computer.  The pharmacist overhears and then comes over. He tells me,\"Oh, your prescription must have been on one of the voicemail messages that were called in. We're backed up, and I have about 10 of them I haven't gotten to.\" Mind you, there are about 6 customers behind me in line. He tells me it will only be a few minutes. I said,\"Okay,\" and went to sit down and play a game on my phone.  \n\nAfter about 5 minutes, I look up, and see the pharmacist is waiting on customers. He never went to the back to work on my prescription.  I sat and waited patiently, trying not to think of the impending snowstorm and my 30 minute drive home.  After about 20 minutes, I couldn't take it any more. I stood up and called to one of the guys in the back,\"So.... will I get my prescription filled tonight, or what?\"  They looked at each other and laughed, and one made a joke to the other in Spanish. The same guy that helped me earlier asked for my name again (and I spelled it for him again about 3 times), and he told me once again it will be ready in a few minutes.  I looked around at all the other customers around me, and only one lady seemed to be bothered by how long it's taking. We started talking, and I found out this was her first time getting a prescription filled there, too. Apparently, the other people were Walmart pharmacy regulars and were accustomed to this substandard treatment.  \n\nKnowing I had lots of time to spare, I walked over to the customer service desk to see if there was a manager I could complain to.  The guy at the desk told me there was a supervisor working at register 4, and that he could could page the manager of the store for me. I thanked him and walked over to register 4. There were about 15 miserable people in line... I was not about to become the 16th!!!  That was just too many for me to get in line to make my complaint! I walked back to the pharmacy, feeling defeated.  There was absolutely nothing I could do.  It was a Friday night, and I would not be able to get in touch with my doctor until Monday for a new prescription.  I was STUCK.  I had no choice but to sit down and wait. On top of that, my phone battery went dead and I couldn't even play my game.\n\nI waited an hour and 26 minutes for my prescription. Considering that they had 7 1/2 hours to have my order ready, it was inexcusable. There were no apologies made WHATSOEVER.  I find it appalling that a company can show its customers so little concern and so much disrespect and still be in business.", "date": "2015-01-24 17:39:20"}, {"_key": "7068441", "_id": "reviews/7068441", "_rev": "_fNzHljC--D", "review_id": "N2Lrjc8jhK_MBsY6kizgew", "user_id": "IpLRJY4CP3fXtlEd8Y4GFQ", "business_id": "ZVkrLNK2Z6zSeCn4U9A7rg", "stars": 1, "useful": 2, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "text": "Today I went in for a bagel twist, and asked to have it toasted with butter.

When it arrived, I was instantly sorry I didn't take our waitress' advice and share it.  It wasn't the best I've had.... the chicken was kind of bland and flavorless.  There were 2 massive pieces of it, but I could barely finish one.  It was ok, but in my opinion, the best Chicken and Waffles in the area is at  The Bistro at Haddonfield or the Silver Diner.  The chicken and waffles at Hash House has the potential, it just needs to be doctored up some.  It is served with what appeared to be fried onions, tomatoes, and a stalk of rosemary.  It still needed something else with kick, so I peppered mine up and added a splash of hot sauce.  \n\nMy niece ordered the shrimp and grits, which she said was good, but kind of \"lumpy.\" LOL.   One sister had the Portabella Mushroom sandwich, and my three nephews and dad had burgers.

They weren't visually appealing to me, and she said they were just ok, and she would never order them again.  \n\nMy main take-away from this experience is that their food does not seem very \"personalized.\"  When my chicken and waffles came, it was cold. That made me feel like it was \"mass produced\" rather than cooked individually and upon ordering.  I think the next time I come, I will probably order some fish from the dinner menu.  The breakfast is just too MASSIVE and too expensive for what it is.  It was very cute inside and our waitress was wonderful, though.\n\nThe only negative thing I have to add is that one of the managers came over and started clearing plates off of our table without even asking us if we were done.

I ordered the Salmon with Angel Hair Pasta, and my boyfriend ordered the Chicken Pomodoro Classico.  Mine was good, just a little buttery, and my bf's was good, but a little on the salty side.  For dessert, we both had the bread  pudding with gelato.  My bf's was better than mine, because somehow I ended up with the endpiece of the bread.  \n\nI think the reason I enjoyed our lunch at Brio today was because we were both playing hooky from work, and the atmosphere of the restaurant fit my mood. It was relaxing.  There was a nice breeze blowing through the restaurant because they had the windows/doors open, and there were no loud patrons cackling in the background to kill my mood.

I mean, HOW IS IT MADE??\"   So... the guy just kind of points to the wall where the menu is. My bf was like,\"I read that. I'm asking YOU.\" Finally, the guy says,\"It's kind of like a patty.\" Okaaaaay... whatever that means!\n\nSo, next, it;s my turn to order. I ordered the fish burger. I had a few questions of my own, and got the same frosty treatment.  When he asked me if I wanted my fries spicy or plain, I asked him what kind of spices are on the fries.

Is it seasoned salt, garlic, pepper, hot sauce, onion powder..\" I ran down a whole list of options because the guy was obviously remedial.

Thankfully, it was warm inside, but a little drafty near the windows. We loved the decor of the restaurant.\n\nWe both decided to go with the Crabcake Benedict.

What restaurant in this day and age doesn't have a microwave?\n\n\nWe toyed with the idea for a minute as she went to find a manager, and decided we didn't really want to wait another 20 minutes for our order.  The waitress returned a minute later without a manager, but said they would make the order over. We told her not to bother, and ate the ice cold meal anyway.

COLD.\n\nFor the life of me, I can't figure out how our food had a chance to get cold when there was only 2 other tables of guests in the place.   Very disappointing.

This was one noisy theater.  It has been about 10 years since I have been to a movie at 69th Street. As soon as the movie started, it dawned on me. The patrons here never SHUT UP.  Not only that, they talk on cell phones and text all throughout the movie, and the light from their phones prevents you from enjoying the movie. There is also a loud beeping that occurs maybe every 5 minutes. Not sure what it is, but I'm guessing the fire alarm?  My ears are super-sensitive, so I found it very irritating and so did my fiance'.\n\nOh, and I saved the best for last. This theater has MICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  One crawled past my feet, and I screamed bloody murder. I had to sit with my feet up for the rest of the movie. DISGUSTING!!!!! Thankfully, I had a Groupon, and only paid $5 for my ticket.
