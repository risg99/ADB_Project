Finally, a nice, new apartment with all the amenities we could ask for in a great location at a reasonable price.  We leased our unit well in advance of our anticipated move--months in advance.\n\nWhen we met with the leasing agent we were given an April expected move-in date--after it was supposed to be ready to give them wiggle room with the construction, though he said they would probably not need any extra days.  Come mid-March, we decided to check in to see how everything was going and ask about the process for picking  up our keys.  We were 1 month from the move-in date at this point.  My boyfriend and I both emailed the leasing office, to no response.  Finally we wrote on their Facebook wall and asked them to get back to us.  An agent then called to let us know that due to construction delays the apartment wasn't going to be ready.  We aren't talking a week late.  It wasn't going to be ready until June!  Over a month delay.  I understand delays happen, but if they were delayed by over a month they should have known well before we reached out to them.  I think being months behind on something is probably pretty obvious...  \n\nThey gave us a few options.  We could a.) rent a larger unit at a higher price and move in on our anticipated date; b.) move into a smaller unit; c.) wait until June to move into our original unit ; or d.) get a refund and find somewhere else to live.  The smaller apartment was too small for all our things, and I was not comfortable paying over $200 more for a larger place that we did not need.  Waiting until June was not an option because our old places had rented already...just a day prior to 23hundred letting us know. They waited almost 2 days to notify us.  I asked the building manager if she thought it would really be ready by June 5 (the new date she gave me) but she said that we should actually plan on mid-June...so why tell us June 5th? So misleading. \n\nI asked for a compromise--to move in to the larger unit at the higher price for 1 month until our place was ready. Not unreasonable, I thought.  I was shot down, even though they had done this previously with other tenants.  The building manager said that the owner did not allow this anymore--that we were welcome to rent the larger, more expensive unit, but that we would be stuck with it for a year and did not have the option to move to our original unit when it was ready.  \n\nI am/was completely upset at their refusal to compromise.  I don't think our request was out of line.  I know others who have been given the same liberty at other apartments.  Also, we had to hound them to call us back.  The only way they were responsive was when I left a comment on the Facebook wall, where others could see.  They also deleted my post off Facebook, which angered me further.  As someone who makes a living in social media management, I can tell you this is poor practice and a big no-no.

We saw people on dates, and families, and friends watching the game.  But this isn't a review of the Santa Barbara Public Market . . . just know that it's lovely.\n\nBack to my bowl of comfy goodness, though.  Warm, silky, flavorful, and slightly spicy (they're willing to kick it up a notch if you want, but I wasn't up to the challenge that night).  A creamy, happy curry noodle soup.  The only thing I might change is the chicken.  It was a teeny-tiny bit overcooked, and more strangely, left in a big chunk in the bowl.  That kinda interrupted my flow, until I got aggressive and just shredded the chicken myself.  Then I was able to get down to business.\n\nMy friend ordered her dish gluten-free, which was great.\n\nThe young lady who helped us was absolutely delightful- even though it was quite near the end of the night, she was cheerful, patient, and did everything she could to accommodate our weirdo requests.\n\nWe didn't sit at the counter, because it was packed full of people.

Pat's is the standard by which all other cheesesteaks should be held. And it is the best place for every \"beginner\" to start. You will probably find better steaks in other places in the city, but this one is guaranteed to still be damn good and give you a starting point for what to expect when you're talking cheesesteak.\n\n\"Whiz wit\" is the only way to go. Actually, scratch that; I have never tried American at Pat's (so I can't say for sure), but whiz is so much better than provolone, that I cannot imagine a better alternative. But in my opinion, no matter what, you HAVE to get it \"wit\" onions. Delicious.\n\nNot only does the STYLE of the cheesesteak at Pat's create an important compass for the cheesesteak virgin, but it also is the process of ordering that is a necessary experience. The workers are still the real deal, unphased by hype or tourism. They're just there to crank out the steaks.\n\nMy biggest \"dropped star\" in this review is the price. I don't MIND paying $9.50 for a cheesesteak, but maybe because just a couple days before, I got a better cheesesteak for almost half the price, I have become slightly embittered. It's not that I don't love Pat's, or that I can't pay the price, I just can't see myself needing to come back here again after finding more fortunate chartered waters elsewhere. \nBut I can't imagine a more deserving place for me to write my 100th Yelp review.\n\nThank you Pat's.

They were delicious, something I would order again but would emphasis no bbq sauce even tough it was tasty bbq sauce with a bit of a kick. Best pork rinds I've ever had. Not usually a fan of pork rinds. We did try to order the brussel sprouts but they were out of them, another veggie and 3 meats. I get running out of the meat but when the veggies are running low they should make more. So disappointed there was only one veggie we could get due to health reason and that they ran out of a couple other options we could have ordered. We decided on the gin salad. It was different, not a big fan of it. Hopefully they'll rework that salad because it has an odd flavor. We also ordered pork belly and pulled pork. The both were very good. Good flavor, texture and temperature. It was a lot of food .

I got the Brussels my first time here also, but they were so tasty I got them again! I also go an eggplant tapenade type of thing. YUM. YUM. YUM.\nThe selection of craft beer they have is on point. There is also their own drink called The Bristol Mule that is SO refreshing! I don't like sweet but this is just enough. I'm a whiskey girl, so they introduced me to a Dad's Hat local on the rocks and it is now one of my favorites.

Baseball was meant to be played outside rain, snow or shine.  Florida gets hot in the summer.  So what?  I've been to a game at Yankee Stadium where the temperature reached 100 degrees which was then followed by a four hour rain delay due to thunderstorms.  Ha, I stuck it out and the Red Sox won.\n\nModern stadiums are built so that all the seats are angled towards home plate no matter how far away you are sitting.  All the seats at Tropicana Park face straight forward with the exception of the special party zones down on the field.  I must also mention that the upper level cheap seats are verboten.  Not for sale.  And they wonder why they have a hard time with attendance for a baseball team that his been in the top 5 of the American League for the past several years.  \n\nI watched StubHub for tickets for several weeks but I ended up purchasing them from the team site since they ended up being cheaper $31 vs. $21.\n\nThe coolest part of the stadium was the Hitter's Museum.  This is an absolute MUST SEE for Red Sox fans.  In fact, Red Sox fans should detour to St. Petersburg during spring training to see the Ted Williams exhibit.  Really great photos and artifacts. Some Tampa fans question why this exhibit isn't up in Fenway.  Well, maybe when the POC stadium in St. Pete gets torn down, the exhibit will go up to Boston.\n\nThere is parking at the stadium but we parked a few blocks away in some mom and pop lot for $8.  We were given a coupon for Ferg's and ended up pre-gaming there.  There were some other options around the stadium, but Ferg's was the most happening place.\n\nGetting the around the inside of the stadium takes a little getting used to although the seating system isn't nearly as arcane as some.  The ushers were helpful although there didn't seem to be any enforcement of keeping fans from entering the stadium during play.  That would have majorly improved our game experience since we had aisle seats.\n\nLots of food and beverage options including a gluten free stand.  \n\nBaseball stadium number 13 was definitely not one of my favorites, but it provided a unique baseball experience all the same.

The first contains Baja Fresh, Qdoba, and is basically just mediocre stuff covered in cheese and wrapped in a tortilla and called Mexican food. The second is the insanely delicious and often very spicy, intricate dishes served in a place where the waiters don't speak the best English and there's a TV playing a concert of some Tejano group. El Jarocho definitely falls into the second group and that is why I love it.\n\nI actually discovered this place through Yelp, by searching restaurants in the $ price range (these days, that's really all I require from a restaurant). After reading the reviews my decision was obvious. I only got to actually be in El Jarocho for a short while because I was seeing a movie soon, but that time just built the anticipation so high. There was a group of people eating and their food looked and smelled great. I ordered some mixed fajitas and as the cooking started the smells became intoxicating and overpowering. I was a little confused by the menu, as it seemed to be split into breakfast, lunch, dinner, and weekend specials, but there was tasty looking dinner stuff in the lunch and breakfast section and I ordered a \"weekend special\" on a thursday without a problem, so I don't really know how strictly they stick to that... if at all.\n\nSo I had to eat my food in a moving car (don't worry, I wasn't driving it) but that didn't lessen my experience any. I was transported from that car into Mexican food heaven. Every bite was delicious and the rice, meat, beans, and veggies all worked in beautiful harmony but each flavor was still distinct. I only wish they provided more beans because I loved them. That being said, they did give a LOT of food. I was a little surprised by the price, considering my meal was I think $14, but it also lasted me for dinner that day, lunch the next, and I think I still have some leftover.\n\nAfter eating, I just couldn't get my mind off these fajitas. The next day all I wanted to do was tell people how good they were. I can't wait to go back and try more of their menu.", "date": "2009-08-02 07:05:44"}, {"_key": "10000137", "_id": "reviews/10000137", "_rev": "_fNEhPWK--D", "review_id": "HEfhtKqrVM_0b-AeC2OGHw", "user_id": "GKZkLZkbFK7UmhLyx-7Qqg", "business_id": "0b7SbKpbNmmoEFCw9Bwwbg", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Standard in layout, and of course, as all the super Wawas, a gas station outside.

We moved to city proper  less than 2 years ago right after we got married. We really like the location of our current apartment but were willing to check out other  options as rates were increasing (again) and we were looking for a bigger place. Was really disappointed in our visit to this office today. Was going back and forth trying to schedule a visit and finally got one and received a call around noon requesting to push back and hour, which was fine once we got there we weren't really sure where the entrance was, so I called the guy back whom asked me to push my appt later but he didn't pick up. Tried again, but no answer, then walked around the whole building and finally found an entrance. \nWalked up to the desk where a guy was siting and I can tell the customer service skills were lacking. We were two young professionals dressed casually and I felt he was profiling us a bit. He asked us for our budget, and we gave the price we are paying now and immediately he seemed a bit disappointed. Little did he know we were very flexible but wanted to see what the building had to offer first. We have learned to start low then work ourselves up because of our experiences in the past. He asked us a few questions then asked for our IDs. My husband had his but I did not because it was a Sunday and we just walked over so we didn't think we needed our IDs. He seemed almost relieved that he wouldn't be able toshow us around because we didn't have IDs and threw some Phila housing jargon at us. If it was needed that much, that information should have been included in the confirmation email, or even the phone call he gave me when he asked me to push my appt back. Apparently I had to be flexible, but he couldn't accommodate us. Needless to say it left a bad taste in my mouth.

The security guard informed us we couldn't have outside drinks, which is understandable for bourbon st and the security guard was the only positive thing that came out of this place.  We finished our drinks, she checked our ID's and ordered four drinks for the four of us.  The whole reason we came over to this joint was the ambiance looked inviting.  Shortly after entering we were quickly disappointed.  A friend of ours went to use the restroom and the three of us were just waiting at the bar with our drinks.  A heavy set manager by the name of Cheryl Charming.  There was nothing charming about this monster.  She came up to us asking for us to show what drinks we had because there was a one drink minimum, when we lifted up our drinks she took her finger and jabbed it at my girlfriend stating \"this drink isn't from our bar\" when we explained that we could show her the receipt and we just bought four drinks for the four of us, she explained there were only three of us and one drink was not from their bar.  We explained to her AGAIN that we paid for four drinks. The bartender could even prove it as well as the security guard and that our fourth person was in the bathroom (this was explained to her three times) then she rudely touched my girlfriend and said she would have to leave and that she was breaking the rules.  Now we were having a good time on NYE and this was our firs time here.  This was only our second drink for the night, no loudness, no trouble, no reason for her to be a bully what so ever.  At this point our fourth friend came back, we told him we were Leaving, then this atrocious human being touched the back of my jacket telling security we were never allowed back in the bar, we explained to her and he security bar we would never come here again based on how terribly she handled a non-issue situation.  We talked to the security guard who was shocked we were treated in such a manner considering\nshe was the one who verified we didn't have any outside drinks with us.  We then walked to the hotel to speak with the manager who kindly apologized.  Not surprising we were followed by another group of people who were upset and stated they had been mistreated by the same manager.  The poor woman, young and pretty as well, said she was also filing a complaint with manager and that they would never come to the facility ever again.  That was the first and last experience we will ever have at this establishment.  We had friends in town showing them the town and this was the worst experience of their week here.

I didn't GO to the wrong restaurant, I REVIEWED the wrong one.  I mistakenly wanted to review The Italian Delight and put my review on the Italian Village Restaurant. \nAnyway...\n\nLets understand something. This restaurant was converted from a Pizza Hut , so your not going to get ambiance.\nBUT , for a neighborhood Italian restaurant this is pretty good.\n\nThe service is excellent as it is all young girls that work there. They are all very polite and see to your needs exceptionally well.\n\nThe menu is quite extensive with a lot of great things to choose from. And as far as the food...\n\nThe food is very good. I.e. Shrimp Fra Diavlo,, the shrimp is clean, plump and generous.\n\nWhat I like are the 1/2 portions they serve. Sometimes, I might want to get an appetizer with my meal.

While the tables aren't set up for big groups, we did find two larger tables next to each other to accommodate all of us. \n\nWe all showed up at staggered times and therefore staggered our drink and food orders. We seemed to have at least 3 different servers - some would only show up to bring you food, another would show up to take orders, another would show up to bring a drink. It was confusing and hard to know who to flag down. When food did get delivered, we were lacking basic things like napkins, silverware, and ketchup so we had to wait until someone came by with those to even start eating. I wouldn't say service was bad, it just felt like they were all making it harder than it needed to be and everyone was causing each other confusion and everything took longer than it should have.\n\nDespite the service confusion, the breakfast went pretty smoothly. We all got our food (correct orders and cooked properly) and there wasn't a single mistake on the checks even when split 5 or 6 ways. \n\nOf course, weekend breakfast requires Bloody Mary's. The way they serve them is kind of unique - you get a tray of condiments so you can customize it to your liking. The tray includes mini bottles of Tabasco, pickled green beans, celery sticks, green olives, and horseradish. Me, liking it spicy, added everything, and even topped it off with some black pepper. So, about the black pepper - the holes are so crushed over that nothing will come out. I shudder to think this, but I bet they just wipe the tops of the shakers off with a rag and so all of the crusty stuff stuck in the holes is the remnants of other diners' food and bleach water. \n\nThe breakfast menu is pretty basic. I stuck with classic steak and eggs. My steak was cooked perfectly medium rare. The eggs were done over medium just like I asked. So, major props on cooking food properly! My boyfriend ordered the biscuits and gravy, which comes with either bacon or sausage. I actually really liked these and couldn't stop stealing bites off of his plate. Biscuits and gravy are hit and miss with me, but I'd eat these again.

I'm not sure what else I can add to the huge depths of reviews for this establishment, so I'm going to go with a review solely filled with \"Tips for your 1st Trip to Fogo.\"  We go to the Indy location 2-3 times a year, and for years my family used to drive to Chicago 1-2 times a year for a Fogo Feast (before we got our own location). \n\nTips for your 1st Trip to Fogo:\n1) If you're worried about the price, go at lunch (Mon-Fri, only).  It's $20 cheaper than at dinner, and the menu is the EXACT SAME.  Everyone (who eats meat) should experience Fogo at least once. They typically do lunch on the weekday holidays as well (i.e. Memorial or Labor Day), which is a great option if you can't sneak away for a LONG lunch. \n\n2) Come HUNGRY, dine slowly, and prepare to leave feeling more stuffed than a Thanksgiving Turkey.  Also, prepare to still feel stuffed for the next 1-2 days.  \n\n3) Not feeling up to a case of the \"meat sweats?\" Get the \"Salad Bar Only\" option. ($20.50/lunch, $23.50/dinner). An entire tasty meal can be made of their \"salad\" bar, which boasts Oh So Much More than salad. Cured meats, cheeses, amazing veggies, and amped up salad selections...it's worth it.\n\n4) Make a reservation, even if it's not during Devour Downtown. We've never had to wait for a table if we made a reservation in advance.  It's super-easy to do online, or pick up that phone if you're feeling old-fashioned. \n\n5) Service can be a little iffy or stuffy...but we've found if you stick it out, smile, and make a connection...they'll actually warm up to you pretty quickly.  \n\n6) Ask For The Beef Rib. They don't usually bring it around (unless they've brought it out of the kitchen for someone else & you happen to catch it in the wild)..it's something they basically only bring out for Brazilians, unless you ask.  It is carved sin on a plate, and is delicious. \n\n7) Tip Well.  Think about how many people interact with you during your meal when you dine at Fogo. 1-3 waitstaff + all those gauchos walking with sharp knives above your head that carve food directly onto your plate without accidentally shish-kabob'ing your skull...that tip has to spread a long way across multiple, skilled people.  \n\n8) Don't forget to grab a handful of their awesome dark chocolate mints on your way out of the door.  It's easy to forget these when you feel like you have to be rolled out the door a'la Violet Beauregarde...but don't miss out.  They're very tasty.  Take a lesson from my husband though, don't leave them in a pocket or coat pocket...they melt VERY easily :-).", "date": "2015-03-02 21:29:10"}, {"_key": "10000261", "_id": "reviews/10000261", "_rev": "_fNEhPWq--D", "review_id": "NJSa787RfQfeFKbqEqjuKg", "user_id": "MhA37DtGUDcx8NQ_buChfg", "business_id": "X97OiYQQun8UpGxqRtgQCQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Great place for groups!

The food put us in that transcendent state of happiness that makes you forget that your teenagers are, in fact, teenagers.  Just for a little while, everyone loved each other, the stars aligned and we were happy.\n\nWe started with the eggplant fries and OMG - smelling them cooking set the stage for the enjoyment to come.  Delicate breading, perfectly seasoned and not at all greasy, this is the way eggplant is meant to be cooked.  The marinara is clearly homemade - visible chunks of tomato and spices made for a perfect complement.\n\nWe sampled everyone's favorite sides - macaroni and cheese was creamy rich with a mix of cheeses that made me moan; potato salad and cole slaw were homemade and some of the best - and most different - you'll ever have.  No store-bought sides here - these were homemade and AMAZING.  \n\nAnd finally - the chicken ... it delivered on the promise of flavorful, tender, juicy and not even a little bit greasy.  I don't know how they do it - the flavor permeated the entire piece of chicken, it was just heavenly.\n\nThis is a don't miss place - and yes, I know in NOLA there are places like this all over, but this one is a \"can't miss.\"  We will be back - even if it's out of the way.\n\nOH and Marilyn gave us great places to shop and browse and other places to eat as well.

My plate I had was good. Probably too spicy, but decent, which is why I gave it 3 stars. I 'm here to talk about the service we received concerning our drinks. They have $15 dollar mimosas here. But what was brought to our table was clearly fizzy juice (see picture I provided) having been Mardi Gras weekend, the last thing you want is to constantly drink sugary drinks and alcohol- the quickest way to get sick. Also.. if I 'm paying for a drink, I would like it to be made right. Mimosas have a ration of 3parts champagne to 1 part Oj. Does this happen often, no, but at least we aren't given fizzy juice. I think what bothered my friends and I more was what the server said. She told us that they were 'Practically giving the alcohol away' and 'don't worry, you are going to get more alcohol' (as if we were worried about getting drunk.) As my friend put it; It does not matter if you do a well made drink and we order 4 of them compared to us ordering 8 poorly made drinks- you will be giving out the same amount of alcohol. We want a well made drink.... \n\nWith that being said, they lost money because out of the 6 of use, we all returned out bottomless mimosas for something else. Also, I would 1) school your server on what a mimosa is, and 2) maybe if you are having difficulty 'giving away' your alcohol, you should work on why your restaurant is not doing too well.... could be the service. \n\nP.S. here is the link to how to make a mimosa if you were wondering.... it's actually served in a champagne flute... could be why you feel you are giving away your alcohol being that we were served in wine glasses. https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/23758/mimosa/", "date": "2019-03-07 22:31:04"}, {"_key": "10000355", "_id": "reviews/10000355", "_rev": "_fNEhPX---J", "review_id": "W4QSaaGPvPm5oG2_q_Y2Qw", "user_id": "bHdkBXNejXSPYEas5haafQ", "business_id": "I2_CZ38y7JTxX6iW_HinkQ", "stars": 1, "useful": 5, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "They claimed my coat was vintage but agreed to sell it.

Like probably five something months, but I never got around to it!\n\nI've been here about 3 or so times now. The first time my friend encouraged me to come, but forgot that she rakes in about three times as much money as me, so my eyes kind of bugged out a little when I saw the menu. $45 for a steak? Jesus. It was really tender, though (had the filet mignon, the smaller size) and it might have been some of the most tender beef I've ever tried in my life. It did have a lot of flavor but man was it greasy.\n\nThe one thing you should know and take away from this review if you ever go here is....*drumroll*....bring Tums. Lots of them. Or some kind of high-strength or prescription antacid. I thought like I was going to die when I got home. The food is so rich that it basically raped my digestive tract. The potatoes (which by the way are a la carte, they don't even come with that $45 steak!) are basically pure butter and will leave you feeling queasy. I barely ate 1/4 of my potatoes and steak and I was about to barf. I had to take it home and eat it the next day and even then I could barely finish it. When they serve your steak to you, it comes on a 700something insanely hot as hell plate and I'm pretty sure if you touched it, you'd have 2nd degree burns or something crazy like that! The sizzling is due to all of the butter they put on the plate. Yeah, you see where I'm coming from.\n\nThe next couple of times I went back, I was hesitant to eat their meat again, but during happy hour they had some special where you can get a mini filet and some green beans for fairly cheap. I think for around $12 or so. I tried that and was more satisfied with it because it was so small and cheap and I didn't feel too sick after. If I ever go back, I'd make sure to go during happy hour to get the cheap meat and wine. Oh and btw their bread is like freaking sex in your mouth. It's the only thing that saved this review from being 2 stars. I literally asked for bread to go which seemed to mortify my \"high class\" friend who went with me. I mean seriously, who gives a fuck if  I ask for more bread? I just dropped about 3 hours of work on a piece of meat, so I will take my bread, thank you very much! lol.\n\nAlso should note: Even though we were both dressed nicely (and she's rollin' in the dough), I still feel like they treated us kind of....weird...because of our young age. Why are so many high-end steak houses at fault for this? *I* may not be spending $100 here but even if I just come for drinks and and appetizer, I don't feel really welcome.

Although it has a rather offsetting entrance, the moment one walks through the door the staff and ambiance do wonders for putting one at ease. \n\nThe atmosphere is amazing. The dining rooms are all wonderfully appointed and are also candle lit, giving the rooms a romantic and warm glow. Faced with this one is automatically comforted and put at ease. It also didn't hurt that my boyfriend and I were seated directly next to a very charming fireplace. \n\nThe waitstaff is animated and very eager to please. Our waitress was very easy going and friendly and had an amazing ability to make dishes that I would normally have no interest in seem mouthwateringly irresistible. \n\nWe were seated immediately despite the fact that we did not make reservations beforehand. The restaurant was still pleasantly full despite the fact that we went during New Hope's slow season. I would suggest making reservations during New Hope's peak season, as I believe seating would otherwise be impossible to come by. \n\nFor starters my boyfriend and I ordered an almond encrusted brie along with escargot stuffed into a puff pastry and made with a very tasty butter and herb sauce. The brie was perfect in both taste and visual appearance. The escargot in puff pastry was also marvelously plated and extremely delicious. The escargot was  perfectly cooked; it was tender and expertly avoided being \"squelchy\" or rubbery. \n\nOur entrees were even better than our appetizers. My boyfriend ordered a dry rubbed angus steak which was cooked just as my boyfriend ordered it. The steak was obviously pan seared before being cooked (to perfection!) in an oven. The steak was covered in a sweet red wine reduction, which accented the flavor of the steak perfectly. The taste is indescribable except if you use the words \"awesome,\" \"amazing,\" and \"perfect.\"\n\nI ordered the veal medallions. My veal was succulent and, again, perfectly cooked. It was topped with a sweet almond sauce which went very well with the flavor of the veal. \n\nBoth of our entrees were served with seasonal vegetables which were cooked to perfection. \n\nThe plating on every one of our dishes was magnificent to behold. They say that the first bite is taken with the eyes and the chef seams to have taken this very much to heart as our dishes looked (and smelled!) mouthwatering. \n\nThis restaurant absolutely shone when it came time for desert. If you find yourself at this restaurant do yourself a favor and order the creme brulee. The top was caramelized beautifully as well as being served in the most adorable pig shaped ramekin I've ever laid eyes on. The sugar that was used to caramelize the top made for absolutely the best tasting caramel I've ever had on a creme brulee. There was a heavy lemon kick to the dessert as well, waking up the dessert with a most pleasant kick. This is without a doubt the best creme brulee I've ever had the good fortune to experience. \n\nThe Inn at Phillips Mill is BYOB. I would highly suggest that one do so, as there are always a very limited selection of beverages otherwise. When my boyfriend and I were there the only options were sparkling water or iced tea. The iced tea was very delicious though. \n\nThe bottom line is that this is the most romantic restaurant I've ever gone to. From the cozy atmosphere to the delicious food this place can NOT be beat. My boyfriend said that it was even more relaxing than being in our own home, it is THAT relaxing. Absolutely amazing. If you are looking for a little romantic getaway this is the best option around. \n\nThat said, please do not bring your children.

I suppose had there been a full bus we may not have been AS punctual. The Nashville to Memphis terminal experience WAS atrocious (if you've read my previous comments); rude staff, a jammed terminal, no communication from staff, late bus, smelly patrons. To be fair, the smelly patrons were actually quite nice once they knew they were getting on their bus. My husband sat near two homeless people and one of the homeless folk sat next to a deranged soldier who was talking about what his therapist had told him and how the Afghanistan has messed him up but it wasn't his fault.)\n\nThe bus driver on this route made an announcement about phones and private conversations not making other riders uncomfortable which I thought was a good thing. It hadn't been done on the last trip and it's fair enough, some things you lost don't want to hear.\n\nAlso, we did not have the same customer service experience in San Diego as we did in Nashville. The clerk there almost seemed happy but that's what living in a place like SD will do. The SD terminal is small, as is the LA one - not done up like the Nashville and Memphis terminals.\n\nWhile I would NOT travel Greyhound cross country, shorter trips are fine.

They may have various types of French fries or fried squid. Some locations may even have various rice bowls. But this location tops the rest because they have a full service ramen restaurant here.

The ramen here is actually pretty good. Granted, it is on the slightly pricier end of the spectrum and the bowls of ramen are not the biggest. But the taste is actually quite good. The noodles have a nice chew to them and the all important 6 minute egg is done well, with the soft egg yolk that you come to expect with a bowl of ramen. Additionally, if you order boba tea with your meal, it comes in these cool Mason Jar glasses, definitely makes for a hip vibe.

Good cheese with the brown spots here and there that make it tasty.\n\n-Smokehouse-\nThis one had gouda, tomatoes, caramelized onions, and Italian sausage. PizzaTom pointed out that the onions were not caramelized; they were cooked but still purple. Some onions were even burnt by the oven. This za was really not that interesting. It wasn't bad but it didn't taste great either. The cooked onions lessened the experienced, and the other toppings did little to enhance. Strongest was the Italian sausage which had a good flavor.\n\n-Verdict-\nI think Smoky has a problem with their topping pizzas because the pepperoni was good. Was definitely better than I thought going in, so good job! I recommend this place to people who have gone there before, but ordered a poopoo pizza, and need to review their pepperoni, and want to be pleasantly surprised.\n\n3 slices out of 5", "date": "2017-03-22 20:40:35"}, {"_key": "10000400", "_id": "reviews/10000400", "_rev": "_fNEhPXG--M", "review_id": "zXDeZR-gExetMqf2y9S95g", "user_id": "vb1Ibf3xAkGH0sYvwfBbXA", "business_id": "dA1NubF15yiyEoI1Sm_6gQ", "stars": 1, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "The worst Chinese food ever.

We had a high-volume, low-cost vet in Ohio that terrorized our cats so much (too many loud dogs! aggressive handling! ACK!) that one cat was \"diagnosed\" with a heart murmur. No, the cat was fucking terrified. The folks at Pets R Our World are not interested in scaring our cats. \n\nWhen we mentioned that one is a former street cat and distrusts new humans, they arranged to give her a vaccine booster in the carrier. Shadow didn't have to leave the cozy little cave or even leave her bed to get a booster shot, which was nice. She very obligingly turned her back on the vet techs, and they very obligingly gave her a shot in that area. Our boy cat was handled a little rougher than I like, but nothing compared to the way our vets in Ohio treated him. He certainly didn't walk out of there scared! \n\nOne of our cats is a leash-walker, and he was allowed to wander all over the waiting room on his leash. We appreciated that; it made him a lot less nervous. The waiting room is both open and a little less cavernous than most vet practices, which is great for letting someone with a scared cat or nervous dog slip into the corner while more out-going animals can sit on the open side to interact with newcomers. \n\nOur appointment was running behind, but we were seen within 45 minutes of our original time. They also offer drop-off service for working pet owners who can't come to a mid-day appointment. With their early opening hours, this is a good deal. No extra charge for drop-off service, either! \n\nThe prices for services are astounding. I cannot complain about our bill because it was the most reasonable vet bill we've ever had. Compared to the pricing for exotic vets (worthwhile but quite expensive), this was a major treat. We are definitely taking our little beasts back to see Dr. Jessica next year for all their well-cat care. (Hopefully, we won't have to take anyone in for being sick!) \n\nPets R Our World participates in the Jefferson Parish TNR program for feral cats picked up in the parish. We didn't realize they were Jefferson only when we brought in a feral for a quick spay, but Dr. Jessica offered us a special price to take care of the mama cat as a one-time thing. If you are in Jefferson Parish, this is the ideal feral cat vet though! Both times we've been in, they've had several ferals in and out.

It packed a rich punch, though, especially with its buttery crust, so I'd recommend splitting.\n\nThe white chocolate brioche, almond croissant, and chocolate pudding were all wins of the highest order. The brioche was a delectable pillow of heaven, its butter and white chocolate pairing a downright dreamy duo. The almond croissant was baked just right and beautifully buttery, flaky and light. The chocolate pudding made me feel nostalgic; it was like an adultified version of a pudding snack, only more refined and, obviously, far tastier, especially topped with the homemade whipped cream.\n\nThere was a single strikeout, though: the caneles. These are a favorite French pastry of mine and whenever I see them, I want. I was surprised to see only tiny ones among the assortment of treats and asked if they made them any bigger, to which the employee replied no. We split an order of 5.

We discovered once we arrived that the seating in the jazz cafe is on a first come first serve basis, so reservations can not be made for this. Our waitress advised that the locals usually take the seating hours before the show begins, so there is usually no available seating once the show starts; however, if there happended to be seats available following our dinner in the veranda, we could pay $3 per person to enter and view the show.  While we could hear the band playing loud and clear in the restaurant, to follow suit with their their sister restaurant, Warmdaddy's, you should be able to make reservations for the jazz show AND dinner.

I honestly am in great disbelief that your business is standing behind someone's wild idea that my golf cart was wrecked before you received it.  The items I want to clarify are as follows and I want to be as clear/transparent as possible before your next response.\n\nMy wife sent a text message to your salesmen Steve.  We included pictures of the frame.  Those pictures also included other various parts of the golf cart showing the golf cart was showing signs of manufacturing defects or poor workmanship on the frame.\n\nI sent Steve a text message notifying him of some broken items.  These broken items are the result of something we did.  I pulled the knob on the light bar to turn it on and it came off in my hand.  That one is on me.  My wife locked the glove box with her possessions in it and a neighbor helped her break the glove box open to gather those items.  I was sitting on the back of the golf cart and leaned on the arm rest and the flimsy plastic cracked.  These 3 items we openly came out, notified and sent Steve pictures.  I informed Steve to give me a quote for those repairs so I could pay for them. \n\nYour delivery driver came to our house to pick up the cart and give us a loaner.\n\nI informed him of the same items I discussed with Steve. \"Frame defects, poorly working brakes, rear passenger side spring sticks, the 3 items above, spinning ignition\"\n\nFor your record and examination I have included pictures from our security cameras for when your driver picked up the cart and the night before as it sat in the driveway.  I want to be completely transparent before your next reply or accusation.\n\nThe day after your driver picked up the cart I received a call from Steve to come to your location to review the cart and go over a few items.  I'm certain you remember the next turn of events.  I don't appreciate being called a liar and accusing me of wrecking the golf cart.  I hope your establishment has cameras on site and if you do I would encourage you to review the footage, verify that from the time the cart left my house without damage to the roof, light bar, windshield and steering wheel and then when it arrived at your location if it was in the same condition as it left my house.  If the cart arrived to your facility wrecked then its possible your delivery driver is not fully forthcoming on what happened during delivery.  If the cart arrived to your facility in the same condition as it left my house then one of your employees damaged the cart while in your possession not mine.  I even told you personally that I would pay for those items when we met you at your location.  You were visibly upset and said that you would take care of it.  You would fix all the broken items and return the cart to us.\n\n \n\nI also don't appreciate your handling of the BBB email.  What other recourse does a customer have when a business is not truthful on how they deal with a customer?\n\nI firmly believe that the information we have provided, the pictures we have given should shed some light on our stance of being open, fair and completely honest with your business and employees.  Currently we don't feel you are giving us the same courtesy or transparency. \n\n \n\nWe appreciate your quick repair of the golf cart the first time.  We appreciate you giving us a loaner while it was being fixed.  I don't appreciate your handling of this entire problem.  Now after only one short trip on the golf cart it no longer works.  It had to be towed back to my house.  I put it on the charger overnight and it will not drive forward or backward.  I switched the box from tow to run after getting the cart towed to the house and cannot get it to do anything.  We also want to bring to your attention that the paint below the windshield is chipped.  Im concerned it will get worse.  That problem was a direct cause/effect of the windshield being damaged.  I am also concerned that the keys for the ignition are not a unique key.  When we bought the cart from Steve he said they were unique.  Even the words on the windshield state that the keys are unique (Picture attached of purchase date).  Based on what I have seen the keys for my cart are the exact same keys as every EZGO. I  am being told you are planning to send out a repair tech or pick it up later this week to investigate.", "date": "2019-07-23 04:01:16"}, {"_key": "10000585", "_id": "reviews/10000585", "_rev": "_fNEhPXu---", "review_id": "h5xFQgSVqwdOZzblVP69BA", "user_id": "s_aDEbDMuIVYWrzp52DFVA", "business_id": "MESkaHVT89UQdsSJhBL2Gg", "stars": 3, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This place is ok. \nThe typical take out Chinese food joint.

Always provides great customer service and I consider more then just my barber now but a friend. I get compliments everywhere I go on my haircut and the profession I'm in I talk to a ton of new people each day and am always confident I look professional and sharp. Thank you Vic for the consistency and respect you always give me. I travel from Northeast Philly to Barber on 24th just because I know I will be getting a amazing cut. The other barbers in the shop are also very kind and provide great customer service. \n\nTIP: Most of these barbers book up extremely fast especially Victoria. I usually try to book my appointment in a couple days in advance because of the high volume of clients she has. It's almost impossible for you to walk in without a appointment. Just speaks of type of work they provide. If you see a barber just standing by usually that means their client is either late to their appointment or a no show. \n\n-Rob D'Andrea\nInstagram- rob_dandrea", "date": "2019-11-18 15:19:39"}, {"_key": "10000590", "_id": "reviews/10000590", "_rev": "_fNEhPXu--D", "review_id": "QvCLlGAjUo53NF6AUO3Fww", "user_id": "Mmn2Q75MgOQ6gXH_bHqAVQ", "business_id": "veRnE8SVhE8l9TiWvPjfVA", "stars": 3, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I am not a connoisseur of German food and this restaurant did not change my mind.

But from the moment we walked in, it was disappointing....dare I say, un-IMPRESSive? We visited on a Friday night and were motioned towards a place to sit from someone behind the counter. There was only one other couple in there at the time, but almost all of the tables were still stacked with dirty dishes from previous patrons who had completed their meal and left. There were three employees talking amongst themselves at the counter, who then preceded to ignore us for fifteen minutes...it was so awkward! They kept looking over at us, looking at their phones, then talking amongst themselves. Finally, someone came over and asked us what we wanted.\n\nWe did our best to make sense of the menu, and stuck to the basics to keep it as simple as possible for our first time. Ultimately, based on other reviews, we did half hot and half regular broth. The menu was full of options; I wish it contained a better explanation of the available options and recommended some combos for beginners, such as myself - especially since the employees weren't available to explain some of the less familiar veggies. (We googled them!)\n\nWe were directed towards a table to make our own sauce as we waited for our food; it had about fifteen little bowls on it, which contained different components (oils, mustards, hoisin, etc) to make your own sauce. Unfortunately, as we were there later in the evening, it was a mess. People had obviously mixed up spoons, and most of the individual cups were now mixtures of a bunch of different flavors instead of being pure. The table they sat on was also a sticky mess; the salt and seasonings were all over, and combined with the goo from the dribbles of people transferring different sauces to their own bowl, it was gross...and very unappealing.\n\nNow, to the actual meal. When the broth arrived, the spicy one was indeed quite spicy, but lacked the depth of flavor I was expecting - not to mention, it was super oily! And, for the regular broth, I've been trying to think of ways to explain the flavor, but can only describe it as boring with an aftertaste of soap. Not very appetizing! The ingredients for the soup were brought in multiple bowls; the meat looked fresh. Unfortunately, some of the things we ordered weren't available because they had run out earlier in the evening, and not informed us. (What a bummer!) There were no instructions provided on cook times, or timers...it was pretty much fend for yourself! We did our best and braved the hot pot!\n\nI wish I had more kind things to say; I am normally a golden-lining kind of girl, but this place just left a bad taste in my mouth for so many different reasons.

My husband and I went last week to try it out, figuring that if we liked it, it could become a regular place to take the kids, with food they would actually eat, and at reasonable prices!  Pulling up we were impressed with the building, the golf course location, and the decor.  The restaurant was almost empty, with one small table, and one larger family gathering of about 10-12 as the only other customers at the time.  \n\nWe decided we would try the sampler, but with seasoned fries rather than portabello fries.  Note that the portabello fries on their own are $7 and the seasoned fries are $4.  Our waitress told her that there was no way they could replace them, and that she could ask, but it would be pointless.  Ok, either you know for sure that it's not a possibility, or you don't know and you ask, without making it seem like it's wasting your time.  So we decided to try the \"asian\" chicken wraps.  There were no drinks on the menu, but considering we walked past a bar on the way in, \"Do you serve alcohol?\" seemed like a legitimate question.  She seemed shocked that we were asking, and then said that they didn't have a drink list, so what kind of drinks did we want?  We asked what wines they had, and she came back from the bar with the names written down.  We ordered the Riesling and Pinot Grigio and when she brought them back, she said she had no idea which was which.\nMy husband got the Cowboy cut Prime Rib, described as being lightly seasoned with steak sauce, and served on top of fizzled onions.  We knew there might be trouble when she asked how well he wanted his prime rib done...  I went with the top sirloin steak, medium well.  Neither one of us noticed that she didn't give us the choice between baked potato, fries, or mashed, as was listed on the menu.\nOne of the other waiters brought our appetizer.  On first glance, I was super excited.  They had the typical choices...chicken, shredded carrots and cucumber... and they had what they called lo mein noodles, wonton strips, and three sauces.  Then we dug in.  The lettuce was small spring mix type lettuce, not typical iceberg, and it wasn't crisp enough to be able to hold anything inside of it.  The lo mein noodles were spaghetti with no flavor, the wonton strips were stale, and the three sauces were an italian type vinagrette, a duck sauce, and something of barbecue consistency that tasted like a black jellybean.\nOur entrees arrived and Jason's prime rib had grill marks on it.  Contrary to what we both thought \"fizzled onions\" would be (sauteed onion slices), they are actually the crispy onions from a can that you put in green bean casserole, and the whole thing was drenched in a less-spicy A-1 knockoff steak sauce.\nMy steak looked alright, but tasted like liver.  We both got baked potatoes.  I got butter and sour cream.  Jason got neither.  At least our steamed vegetables were good (and like an old folks' home dining room, they are all you smell as soon as you walk in the door.)\nHalfway through we ordered another glass of wine each.  She brought it to is explaining that she found out how to tell the difference... that Pinot is almost clear, and Riesling is darker.... Ummmmm not most ones that I've tried but ok.  The confusing part being that neither one of the glasses tasted quite the same as our first.  We chalked it up to being a little wine buzzed and having traumatized taste buds, but when we got the bill, we realized that they had given us four completely different (and differently priced) glasses of wine.\n\nBut hey, at least we had shirtless rednecks rebuilding engines on the Speed channel to watch on the big screen TVs on the walls...", "date": "2008-10-20 22:15:35"}, {"_key": "10000646", "_id": "reviews/10000646", "_rev": "_fNEhPX2--K", "review_id": "tEew4BpwtNy6O3k3qndvrA", "user_id": "Hje0s_S8wKZ7wsO5RaebUg", "business_id": "QDJO9PzZ82tU4rlzzOFRSw", "stars": 1, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Appallingly bad customer service.

You no like that? Stop reading!  But why go to an \"artisan chocolate\" store, why pay 10 times the cost of a Hershey's bar per pound, unless you got a little snob-ola in you too. \n\nSo let's get serious. There is good chocolate, and there is REALLY good chocolate. Since Bissinger's is priced firmly in the latter category, one should have big expectations. These expectations in my fishy opinion are not fulfilled. The core product, the block chocolate is decent. It's not in a league with Valrhona and hardly as good as Scharfenberger, except when really really fresh. And there's the rub. The Bissinger's people don't seem to understand that expensive chocolate should be fresh, that freshness matters. (The \"expert\"  behind the counter even told me that \"chocolate is good for a year,\" which is certainly true if we're talking about a Snicker's bar, but are we talking about Snicker's Bar?????) \n\nToo often at Bissinger's I get stuff that's just not that fresh. Unfortunately, this has even been the case with flourless chocolate cake: it wasn't old (that would be a scandal) but it wasn't super fresh either (and that's a problem). The confections are consistently average. Again, not a baaad experience. It's chocolate, after all. But this is not the kind of experience that they should be aiming for. \n\nMessage to the boss: quality control. Throw that stuff away when it's more than a few weeks old.

Stassi's is kind of far from us, but we are in a rather undeveloped area of Hudson.  However, it is the ONLY Italian restaurant within 5 miles of us.  Thankfully, we like it!  We have always supported the mortgage of Argento's in New Port Richey when they were Hudson.  However, now they moved to NPR and WE moved to Hudson.  Frustrating.  So, since we knew we would not be at our favorite place nearly as often, we had to find a restaurant that could at least match it.  We found that in Stassi's.  We have them for take out at least once a week.  They do deliver, but generally, we are making a trip to Publix nearby, so we just pick up from there.  \n\nTheir pizza isn't bad, but then again, I am kind of a pizza snob.  However, their food is VERY good.  They always make their pasta just perfectly.They make a delicious chicken parm, whether part of the dinner or on a hero.   My husband is a big fan of one of their chicken dishes, Chicken Alex, with a sauteed garlic, sun dried tomato and feta in a Chardonnay sauce.  It's very tasty.  I often want to order it, but admittedly, I am kind of addicted to their meatballs and spaghetti.  Every take out order entree comes with a good sized piece of warm italian bread and a small side salad which is always cold and fresh.  The food is always nice and warm.  Entrees range about $12,95 to $16.95 or higher for certain fish dishes in season.  \n\nThe reason I am giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is because they ALWAYS screw up my take out order.  Always.  I usually always order spaghetti and meatballs.  That one they don't mess up.  But every once in awhile, I throw them a curve ball and order a chicken parm, easy on the parm and with light sauce on the spaghetti.  I end up getting no cheese at all (so basically, just a chicken cutlet...which is delicious, but not what I ordered) and for some reason, a side of ziti with a mild amount of sauce, instead of spaghetti,  I don't know why this happens, really.

I was happy to learn that this place isn't tiny, as the outside appearance might lead one to believe, but actually quite large with standing room/dance floor and tables for sitting. They have food, which I didn't try, and a large bar which I didn't order from personally. I did enjoy two bottles of wood chuck cider, thanks for having that option.\n\nI just liked the vibe mostly. The high ceilings and different seating levels made the space open and it didn't feel too crowded even though the place was packed.

I come when I can, not when a nail tech tells me too. I found that very rude. \n\nThird, when you have a lot of people waiting you don't yell \"she (another customer) wanted me so if I'm not doing her I'm not doing nobody else\" while it's customers waiting to be seen. You also don't yell \"I told you, you need to tell people no we close\" especially when the people that came in didn't come in at closing time.

I will be calling the state on this salon for sure in the morning. \n\nI wasted a hour of my time seating in a salon for me to have to leave with my nails looking worst than when I fucking came in. \n\nThis salon was beyond THE WORST I HAVE EVER BEEN TO AND I DONT RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE.

Definitely one of the best Embassy Suites ever! So beautiful inside and out-huge and accommodating! We love it here! The only issue we had this time was we came in late and checked in late and was given a handicap room :/ There wasn't a diff. though so that was ok. The room was clean and I have to say how great the cleaning staff was! We stayed here 4 nights and every night we came home to a very clean, well stocked, beds made room! It was really nice to back to. The front staff is ok, not the friendliest this time around but definitely cordial enough. The breakfast was better than 3 yrs ago where there were huge lines for the hot breakfast and omelette line. oh yes this hotel does force everyone to go through their hot line if they want even bacon and sausages. So beware of that. So many days my teens who wake up late would op for the usual eggs and biscuits outside of the line. Weekday mornings weren't bad at all this time around. But Fri and Sat breakfast did get packed but the line moved quickly enough and loved how they open pretty late for weekend breakfasts. There was a NCAA BB tourney and many reunions that weekend so it was a busy hotel and some people stayed up way past 2am and laughed and talked all night long in the lobby which echoed all the way up the hotel. But even that didnt' bother us too much bc of how comfortable our rooms were :) All in all, love this hotel and will try our best to stay here again if in town.

I have no problem washing hands, etc. But what I don't appreciate is you complaining about the time it takes to paint my nails when you didn't ask me that to begin with. I'm not complaining and I'm paying??? \nWith everyone around me enjoying themselves it seemed out of character. \nWhatevs, maybe a bad day for her I'm here for the nails not chatting up.

The store opens at 11, but when I called, I was told they don't do bridal appointments until noon. On the website, you can make an 11AM appointment, so I was confused. I ended up cancelling the appointment because I had to fit in several other shops. \n\nI did keep my appointment to look at bridesmaids dresses. My experience was terrible. I felt extremely rushed, despite the fact that my party were the only customers in the store. The saleswoman asked me a few questions about my dress, but I hadn't purchased it yet so I wanted to keep my options open for bridesmaids. She brought me over to the rack and started pulling things. I hardly had time to look at them before I was ushered over to the fitting rooms for everyone to try dresses on. \n\nShe made all of my girls use the same fitting room, which I thought was slightly inappropriate. The woman kept disappearing while my girls were trying on dresses, then she'd reappear and try to push the sale. After a while, we found 2 I liked. This was the first appointment I'd had for dresses, so I wasn't ready to make a decision. The saleswoman kept saying \"well is it this one, or this one?\" \n\nWhen I asked if we could write down the style numbers and come back, she became very agitated. She said we all had to be there at the same time to get measured and fitted, which I thought was ridiculous. When I refused to purchase dresses right then and there, she finally wrote down the style numbers for us. She told us 4 different times that we had to make an appointment with HER and reminded us of her hours at the store. She took someone else's business card, crossed their name out, and wrote her name, hours, and \"please call for appointment\" in large print on the card before handing it to me. \n\nI understand that people work on commission, but if I'm going to spend over $1000 in a store, I expect to be treated with respect.

The tomato pie was good, a nice crunch and tomato mix. Not much else to speak on. \n\nFor the pizza, we ordered a #1 which was a cheese and tomato pie (we did not order any add ons) and the Swiss chard. The tomato pie is simply perfect. It was the perfect amount of crunch, thickness, char, and oil without it being too greasy. The Swiss chard was also very good, though some might label it as too garlicky. It is definitely very forward with the garlic so it has a bite. Not spicy but just that raw garlic bite to it. \n\nOur server was attentive as she kept filling up our waters and bringing another bottle when necessary. Didn't necessarily go out of her way to make our dinner memorable in anyway or engage with us, but it was not bad.\n\nOverall, it was enjoyable and the pizza lives up to the hype but it is very noticeable they are still working out some kinks in terms of service and the other dishes on the menu.

I let her know how disappointed I was with the whole experience, but she didn't seem to care and just said she was sorry about the fries.\n\nNow the food. It was subpar at best. The burgers tasted like dried out school cafeteria and the fries were just decent. Definitely well below expectation after the reviews.\n\nOverall, we were severely disappointed.

Truly impressive (or so it seemed to me, I'm really ignorant when it comes to the world of beer).\n\nAnyway, I was hungry for a burger & heard that the food here was decent so that's how I found myself at Eulogy.\nAnd indeed, my burger did not disappoint.  It was huge & flavorful with fresh lettuce, tomato & mushroom.  I was very pleased with my burger.\nWhat I REALLY loved though, was the crispy crab starter.  Holy crap, freakin' delicious.  I had to hold myself back from just attacking it, it was sooooooo good.  A lump crab mix surrounded by potato strings, all deep fried together.  Oh my gosh, amazingly delicious.  You have GOT to try this starter.\n\nThe ambiance of the place was kind of dark and old (in a good way), really quite different from pretty much anywhere else in Old City.  We were seated in a sort of extra-dark nook upstairs which was SO cool.  The dining tables were like museum display boxes w/ skulls (& business cards galore!?) inside of them & the one longer table was basically a coffin!  Totally creepy & awesome!!\nThe one thing I did not like about beat seated back there was that the light switch for said nook seating area was right next to the bathroom door & EVERY person who went to the bathroom flicked that particular dining area's light off.  Most instantly realized their mistake, but some did not leaving the patrons to turn the pitch dark nook's light back on.  Annoying.\n\nThe service could have been a little better, I thought.  When we first arrived it wasn't too busy, but our waiter was REALLY slow.  It also took a pretty damn long time for our starters to arrive.\n\nStill, I'd return.

If you host a party here, you can't bring your own food, but they do provide an array of options.

Then it was just like whatever since I was full from the rueben. I gave it 2 stars based on atmosphere, selection of beers, and the rueben was pretty good (but really, can you screw up a rueben too bad??)...however, the service sucked and $11.95 for a rueben is bull. If I was in the area again, I might go for the beer and atmosphere but would eat somewhere else just for the prices of the \"pub food\" alone.", "date": "2012-09-02 15:20:27"}, {"_key": "10000978", "_id": "reviews/10000978", "_rev": "_fNEhPYy--_", "review_id": "gkn5sRJjGXLMZT63CSKDiQ", "user_id": "IfcVmjrrWv2VTVqE5GyHMQ", "business_id": "78c0LRo34yNcbTIPIbjISg", "stars": 2, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Very pushy up front with sales.

Valet parking is offered, plus there is free street parking.\n\nThe building both outside and in is fabulous.  Made of brick, fitted with industrial-style pipe accessories and cool lighting, they have interesting sculptures scattered everywhere, and unique artwork lining the walls.  TIP 1 - there are at least 2 Picasso signed/numbered prints - find 'em!  I also heard rumor of a Dali, but didn't get to see it.  \n\nAt the small but efficient bar, I had one of their specialty cocktails - the Native Summer, a light refreshing Nolet's gin drink which was delicious.  TIP 2 - the unique pictures next to the bar represent their signature drinks - see if you can figure out which is which.  \n\nWe were lucky enough to get a behind the scenes tour of the brewery with the charming brewmaster, and you could just tell how passionate he was about this aspect of the restaurant.  There is even a beer garden courtyard area which would be great for hanging out.\n\nNow, on to the food - it was so fun going with a huge group of people, and the passing of plates and sharing of food was a constant.  I was so pleased to taste so many different things.  My personal favorites - okra fries, roasted beet and poached pear salad with goat cheese, charbroiled oysters, Florida Native chili, and the special berry ice cream.  \n\nOther items I enjoyed getting to try but wouldn't necessarily order (again):  white Lima beans and collards (too garlicky), corn beer quick bread (not enough flavor), the chocolate torte (too intense), and my dessert - the Guava Pie.  The pie sounded awesome, but it just had a very odd flavor that even the guava reduction on the side couldn't save.\n\nEverybody we met working in the restaurant was welcoming and engaging.  Our two servers were spot on - friendly, efficient, and knowledgeable - although they need to recognize that when people ask for entree recommendations, they shouldn't list every item! \n\nSo happy to have a place like this in town!

If I ever need windshield repair in the future, I will definitely come back.\"\n\nI am updating my review because now one of those chips that was dismissed as not needing to be repaired has turned into a large crack that will require replacement of the whole windshield.  I brought my car in today and the representative said \"Huh, we missed that. Nothing that could have been done, though.\"  He shrugged his shoulders and told me it would be over $200 to replace.
