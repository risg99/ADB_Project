Super bonus: they have shrimp and grits on the menu! I am giving the place a 3.5 stars just because they have only been open about a month and they are still working out some issues.\n\nWe were here for lunch and there was a good crowd, but it wasn't packed. They have a pretty diverse menu with things like fried catfish, shrimp and grits, pasta and even lobster. I decided to be less predictable this time and I get the corn and crab bisque and the fried catfish Lafitte lunch special which came with sausage jambalaya.\n\nThe waitress brought out my entree before my corn and crab bisque. I had intended the bisque to be my appetizer, but I guess I should have mentioned that, The catfish was interesting. It was topped with red sauce (which the waitress mentioned ahead of time) and it was fried nicely. The jambalaya was okay, but didn't really dazzle me.\n\nThe corn and crab bisque was just okay, as well. It didn't taste the way other bisque I have had in the past tasted. I don't know how to explain it, but I was expecting more. My dad got the shrimp and pasta and wasn't that into it either. He was so not into it that he let me take his leftovers home so I could eat it later. When I tried it, all it was was flavorless pasta and overcooked shrimp- disappointing.\n\nOur waitress was beyond sweet and made sure that we were happy with everything. Like I said, this spot has only been open a month so I expect them to work out the issues and do okay.

Since I don't have a car, I would never have known about it if it hadn't been for friends who HIGHLY recommended it (for good reason, I discovered!). However, they do have a parking lot, so at least that's off your list of worries. \n\nThe inside of the restaurant is spacious and pristine, giving off a casual ambiance with a touch of traditional Korean elements. Hence, it can accommodate small groups fairly easily. For example, on my first visit, I think I came with a group of 6-7 and we all fit comfortably around a table, and could have probably seated just as many more on the adjacent table.\n\nAnd now, the menu! As the name of the establishment suggests, its specialty is the soft tofu (soon doo boo) and it is SUCH a great deal at $10 for their different kinds! Kimchi soft tofu, seafood soft tofu, clam soft tofu, beef soft tofu, etc... yum! And they do it legit too - providing you with a raw egg that you crack into the stone pot of hot soup. Oh, and before I forget to mention, you can also adjust the level of spiciness when you order (if you don't specify, they will just give you the average spicy level, I believe). If you're not in the mood for soon doo boo, they do have other Korean food options on the menu. Admittedly, I typically gravitate immediately to the soft tofu whenever I visit, but I've tried the dak galbi once, which was also delicious and fairly generous in its portions.\n\nSpeaking of portion sizes, the restaurant is famous for their amazing side dishes that they refill if you ask when you finish (can't imagine how many plates they have to wash!). With the side dishes and the rice that comes with your main meal, it's a lot of food in my opinion. So basically, go hungry :)\n\nAnd a final adorable touch is that they typically give you a little mint candy with the check, which gives the feast the proper conclusion that it deserves.

Seeing all of the other rave reviews makes me want to head back and see if the Sunday when we dined was just a rare fluke. I feel like we were jipped out of this amazing experience everyone else had. We were so excited to treat my parents to this meal. We were a tad embarrassed about how it turned out....\n\nRight off the bat, ordering was fairly difficult. They did not speak one word of English. Many mistakes were made and any special requests we had were unable to be fulfilled because of the language barrier. We spoke with two individuals, neither understood us. At all. I think that unfortunately set the tone for the meal. \n\nWe had a larger party and below is what everyone had to say. I personally can only comment on the mushroom tofu soup which I actually really loved and am totally craving right now after looking over my photos. The scallion pancakes were a tad soggy and lacking in flavor for me and the dumplings were just ok. I've had better. A tad too slippery and slimy for my taste. The plain rice was so delicious for some reason. Piping hot. Yum. \n\n3 yelps Beef soup. Not enough beef. Banchan Sides were good. Ribs were good. Chicken was just alright. \n\n3 yelps seafood tofu soup just two shrimp (one with eyeballs) Barely any seafood. \"Floating yuck\". Beef was really good. Chicken was just ok. \"$12 for a bowl of tofu?\"  Dumplings were good. A little mushy. \n\n2 yelps they don't have anything for kids. \n\n4 yelps Excellent rice plains and simple. \n\n3 yelps mushroom tofu soup was very good. Beef was the best out of everything. Chicken was average. \n\n3.5 yelps Chicken was not BBQ as stated. \nScallion pancakes weren't crisp, were too greasy and a tad bland. \n\nTons of food so think twice when ordering. Don't forget about all of the side that come first. The place was pretty cute. A nice find for the area. I think everyone could appreciate the authenticity of the meal for example the raw egg to place in our soon du bu, but Something just wasn't happening the way we had hoped and the way it seemed to for others.", "date": "2016-06-03 01:10:12"}, {"_key": "5135305", "_id": "reviews/5135305", "_rev": "_fNzFy7S--_", "review_id": "WbcN0PfEgH-sWaQKUNJYlA", "user_id": "qX9rK32qy5hiYo9EPPJftw", "business_id": "QWqKTWQ2OiDgo3dzNkpung", "stars": 5, "useful": 10, "funny": 5, "cool": 6, "text": "Since moving from Korean food heaven (aka. Los Angeles) to Philly a few months ago, I've tried over a few dozen Korean restaurants and I've been fairly disappointed in every single one of them. All of them had ok to terrible tasting Korean food and they were all overpriced for the quality that they served. I was about to give up on all Korean food in the East Coast and write it up as a hopeless endeavor.\n\nAnd that all changed when I came here.\n\nI was told about Jong Ka Jib by a friend who knew I was looking for good soon doo bu and how I'd been so disappointed in all of the Korean places around the area. I honestly didn't think this place would be any different but I was thinking, \"Hey, at this point, I might as well start conditioning my mind into thinking this is good Korean food.\" and I went.\n\nI was blown away. Not only is Jong Ka Jib the best Korean food I've had at a restaurant since moving out from LA, but I would definitely consider it one of the top ten soon doo bu places I've ever been to in my life. Granted, it's not in the top 3 in my opinion but it's definitely up there. I had the pork soon doo bu extra spicy and ordered a side of kalbi ($15). The soup base was very tasty and it wasn't too watery or thick. And the tofu was cooked to perfection. They give out perfect portions too so after you finish eating, you should be pretty full.\n\nDon't be surprised or put-off when you come in and see a ton of non-Koreans eating here (white and Chinese) if you're not used to that. I myself, coming from LA, if I went to a Korean place and saw the customer base were mostly non-Koreans, I walked out because from experience, the food did not taste like Korean food but very Americanized. This place doesn't follow that trend.\n\nThe service here is just ok, or maybe even below ok but that's what I've come to expect and experience when I was in LA going to good Korean restaurants. It's rare to find a Korean place that has great service and great food. The galbi was terrible though. Don't get it. First off, it's not marinated very well and the flavors come across a bit funky. Second, it is way overpriced for the amount and quality of the meat. I shared the kalbi with two other people and we didn't even finish the galbi. That's how bad it was. As long as you stick with the soondoobu, and the occasional pajun (Korean pancake), you'll be very happy.\n\nAfter my oh so amazing experience here, I came here two more time thinking maybe it was a fluke. And no, it wasn't. I think I've found my home here.\n\nParking: Limited lot or street\nPrice: $10 per person\nWait: 10 mins after order (during rush hour you will wait an hour to be seated so beware)", "date": "2013-11-17 00:45:48"}, {"_key": "5178698", "_id": "reviews/5178698", "_rev": "_fNzF0ky--I", "review_id": "PLcCVZRwZ7liZ3hyTAoDNA", "user_id": "NMOxipsnXc6olWdHYzXiYA", "business_id": "QWqKTWQ2OiDgo3dzNkpung", "stars": 3, "useful": 1, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "text": "I noticed this place the first time I went all the way up to this area to check out Cafe Soho as it's only about a minute away from it.  I love tofu and Korean food, and after reading the good Yelp reviews, I knew it was a place I had to check out especially now with Miga in downtown Philly being closed.  \n\nThe decor is all wooden and what I assume is old traditional Korean style.  We were seated immediately and given menus.  In less than a minute we were brought a pitcher of water and the waiter was ready to take our order.  However, I wasn't that familiar with the menu, so we weren't ready yet.  I decided on the pa-jun (Korean pancake), that I seem to order at every Korean restaurant I go to because I like it so much, and an order of the vegetarian mushroom soft tofu stew.  The waiter asked us if we were sure we didn't want seafood and not the vegetarian pajun.  I will eat seafood, but I'm not too fond of the octopus and squid that usually end up in Korean food.  I told him I preferred the vegetable one.\n\nAbout 6 Banchan (Korean side dishes) were brought out including:  Kimchi, beansprout salad, seaweed salad, and a few other things that I'm not sure exactly what they were.  They were okay, but I've had better at other places. We were also brought a raw egg, which I assumed was for our stew.   Our food came out within five minutes, and then the waiter was never to be seen again until we flagged him down for a check.  \n\nThe pajun was okay, but only had scallions in it.  At other restaurants when I order the vegetarian one, other veggies like kimchi, peppers, mushrooms, or carrots are usually included as well, so that was a bit disappointing.  The tofu stew was good and boiling hot in temperature and spice, but I didn't think it was superior to ones at other restaurants.  I did like the rice in the stone bowl, but it was really hard to get it off the sides and no one came around and poured the warm water/tea in our stone bowl at the end of the meal like others had written about.  We also were not instructed what to do with the egg (I wasn't sure if it was for the rice in the stone bowl or the stew), and the server dropped off the food so quickly and ran off that I couldn't even ask.  I wasn't getting any 3G on my phone, so I couldn't check back here on Yelp, so I guessed and put it in the stew.  It tasted good though.\n\nThe best part of the meal was the low price.  We only paid a little over $20 for the whole meal for the two of us and we left feeling full.  I would go back if I was in the area for the stew again, but I don't think I'm going to drive out of the way for it since the service was a little lackluster and I can get similar dishes at other places.", "date": "2012-08-25 20:29:05"}, {"_key": "5193385", "_id": "reviews/5193385", "_rev": "_fNzF1Ei--Z", "review_id": "TIVu9EqA2gnzFqPKyb0bxg", "user_id": "-OZPBHH7RzyPIai4AlPWKA", "business_id": "QWqKTWQ2OiDgo3dzNkpung", "stars": 5, "useful": 12, "funny": 14, "cool": 12, "text": "I ate here 5 hours ago and I'm considering making the 25 minute drive to eat here again right now. \n\nLots of vegetarian options, so you're good there if you have a ton of vegetable eating friends like I do.", "date": "2014-06-15 22:31:10"}, {"_key": "5256522", "_id": "reviews/5256522", "_rev": "_fNzF3RC--Z", "review_id": "xrgW1vWxm9Zj84obYDcZFQ", "user_id": "67jznGBPOlZiZfC71RipQA", "business_id": "QWqKTWQ2OiDgo3dzNkpung", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I've had Soon Du Bu at other places (including the popular BCD in NYC), and this is still the best tasting.\n\nThere's a reason this place is also known as \"Soft Tofu House\" - it's their specialty and they do it right.

It can be inconsistent at times, so I would suggest erring on the lower spice level if starting out.\n\nThe bonchon (side dishes) are good here, but there isn't a large variety. I haven't seen fish cakes or squid in a looong time - maybe they are no longer offered.\n\nThe soup themselves comes out in a stone bowl, piping hot. So be careful.

Don't expect a chatty server.

The beef definitely adds to it.\n- Beef soon du bu - Also very good.\n- Soy bean (daeng jang) soon du bu - This is sort of an acquired taste, and doesn't come with any meat in it... but I love that salty soy bean taste!\n\nThe other thing that happens at many Korean restaurants is that you get to choose the level of heat.

I was going to give it a 3 but I'll give it a 4 for benefit of the doubt.\n\nFor those of you who frequented Dhaba before, here's the lowdown on the transition: the menu is smaller. They took out all the awesome little street snacks (REST IN PEACE) and some of the main dishes, but still have dosa, a lot of vegetarian and meat entrees, and of course biryani. Another change is that it looks like the price has increased slightly, which isn't a huge deal, but Dhaba was already pricy, so dinner for 2 here last night was $30. They still have a buffet at lunch, and it seems like a lot of the same stuff probably carries over to that. Didn't recognize any of the employees, but some of the dishes were similar if not the same, so clearly there are connections between the two.\n\nI ordered the chicken biryani. PSA, it's definitely big enough for 2 people to share if not literally 3 people. I mean, it's massive. For some reason I thought it wasn't quite as flavorful as Dhaba's biryani (interesting since it's called Biryani Hut), but was still pretty tasty. Unfortunately I didn't even make it to the chicken, which was all at the bottom of the (very deep) bowl. I took home not one but two to-go boxes full of biryani.\n\nMy friend had the chicken 65, which is an item carried over from the Dhaba menu. This was still really good. The waiter asked what spice level she wanted: mild or American mild...LOL. The American mild surprisingly still packs a bit of heat, but that's not surprising because this chicken is literally red from all the spices.\n\nIf you're going to order naan, don't bother with the regular, try the butter or garlic or some other kind. The regular naan was not good. It was super thin. (Downgrade from Dhaba' s pillowy naan, sigh.)\n\nI need to try some more things here to really sort out my opinion of it. I'm sure it's a good restaurant, I'm still just so attached to Dhaba that Biryani Hut didn't live up to expectations.", "date": "2018-03-17 17:03:50"}, {"_key": "5138005", "_id": "reviews/5138005", "_rev": "_fNzFzBK--K", "review_id": "cDS458sB8U2QPFAvrMY2tg", "user_id": "5GLB61xLOP6T-pNsr7rslg", "business_id": "Oy7rU9H76PN1hsDU9EUt5g", "stars": 4, "useful": 10, "funny": 2, "cool": 2, "text": "This was my third escape room and the first of which I did NOT escape from.

The interior is brightly colored and there are several TV's on the wall. It took the staff a little bit of time to greet us. We told them we did not have a reservation and hoped we could get a table. The restaurant was only 1/2 full. After a brief discussion they were able to seat us.\n\nThe Boiling House, like other restaurants (Hot & Juicy, Bistro SouthEast, Crabby Cafe, etc) of this style puts a big piece of paper over the table and provides a bucket for the shells. We ordered the shrimp and snow crab boil, garlic noodles, sweet potato fries and spring rolls.\n\nThe Good - The food was excellent, we had the Cajun sauce for the boil and it was delicious and the seafood tasted fresh. We asked for medium heat and this was not spicy, if you like heat you should ask for a higher level. The garlic noodles were very good also and the sweet potato fries were outstanding. The one disappointing point about the boil was that potatoes, corn and sausage were all an extra charge. Usually there are a few pieces of these items included in the other boil type restaurants we have tried.\n\nService was spotty the whole night. Our original waiter disappeared and we had a couple of other ones. I don't know where he went. The food took about 25-30 minutes to come out which isn't terrible. However the spacing was a bit off. The first item to arrive was the garlic noodles. Then after about 10 minutes the spring rolls and the two boil items came out together. It would have been better if the spring rolls came out first and then the noodles with the seafood.\n\nThe staff at the Boiling House seemed a bit overwhelmed also and that is probably due to some growing pains. They didn't give us bibs, or plastic gloves that some other tables had. These usually come in the bucket; we had to ask for the bibs. \n\nWe did have a nice meal at the Boiling House and for right now patience is a virtue.

A friend (yes, he happens to be Indian) recommended this place to me.  He claimed this to be the best Indian in the naptown area.  I had to examine the claim.\n\nAMBIANCE- The place is in a strip mall, but when you walk in, the place is bright and open (unlike many Indian restaurants I've been to).  Seating is probably about 50-60ish, though they may have a backroom (I cant' recall).\n\nSERVICE- for a buffet, I didn't really expect much service.  The servers were friendly though, and were very quick to replenish the naan (more on that later).\n\nMENU- this place has to have one of the more exhaustive selections as far as a buffet goes.  Many of your favorites can be found here- palak paneer, rav korma, pakora, tikka masala, goat curry, tandoori chicken etc....  They have an interesting \"Chicken 65\" which in my opinion is like boneless buffalo wings Indian style.  Standard desserts such as mango pudding and kheer (rice pudding) can be found, as well as chai to finish up the meal.  Oh yeah, the naan.  They bring out fresh orders of naan (either garlic or regular) with the buffet as well.\n\nFOOD- most everything is delicious.  I must say I was a little disappointed with the palak paneer as it seemed to be a little too pureed in my opinion, and it being a buffet, the food tends to lack a little heat, but you can always add some spice if you need to.  The garlic naan is really strong, but very good as well.  The kheer has raisins, but you can pick them out if that ain't your thang.\n\nOVERALL- come hungry, leave happy.  This place rocks.  $9 for lunch (plus you can get a $1 off coupon at indycoupons.com) is money well spent.  If you've been wanting to try Indian food, or are just looking for some good Indian food, this is your best bet.

We had planned to dine in at some point but on the spur of the moment one evening, decided that Indian takeout was in order. The ordering process went smoothly, pick-up was quick and timely, and everything was packaged well to make the trip home to our kitchen a breeze. Even with a 10-minute drive, the food stayed hot.\n\nI had the Chicken Korma and my husband had half a Tandori Chicken and the Mattar Paneer. We split an order of the vegetable samosas for an appetizer. Overall, we were satisfied with the meal, but comparing it to Indian food from back in Philly, it seemed a little bland to us. Though my husband was pleasantly surprised to find out how spicy they made his meal (they asked about heat level when we ordered). He likes things pretty hot, so he found it to be just right. I asked for regular or moderate spiciness and didn't find any heat in my dish. The hubs thought the paneer was a little chewy compared to other paneer dishes he has had in the past. Our overall biggest disappointment was with the samosas. I love samosas and for me, these missed the mark. Low on spice and flavor and really heavy on potato in the filling. I also noted that they didn't seem fried all the way; the dough was kind of chewy on the inside (and for the record, it didn't seem like a lack of crispiness that you might expect as a peril of takeout, because they actually were crispy on the outside).\n\nSo, I would probably go back to Amber and give them another chance before I made a final call, but it was just a good experience, not great.

My husband doesn't understand why I don't have a primary care doctor, but I tried once and the three I called weren't taking new patients! I was experiencing flu like symptoms so my OBGYN told me to go get swabbed for the flu. Luckily while looking online to see the closest minute clinic I noticed I could also put myself in line remote. DO THIS. There was a forty-minute wait time, but when I got there I waited ten minutes! I'm assuming both myself and the man in front of my put ourselves on remote waiting whereas the woman sitting there did not. Both of us came around the same time so I saw our names on the board go from not arrived to present. He was taken immediately and I just had to wait for him to be done. The woman who was sitting there who was marked present the whole time had to wait for both of us. Don't be that woman, be like us instead and take advantage of remote wait.\n\nThe nurse practitioner did all the normal vital sign checking and after swabbing me determined that I did indeed have the flu. She asked if I had difficulty reaching my OBGYN earlier in the day since I'd have to call back to let them know the diagnosis and when I said yes, she actually picked up the phone to call them for me! (Turns out the office was closed for lunch, of course they were). She had my prescription filled right at the pharmacy so I wouldn't have to go anywhere else. She seemed pretty worried about my wellbeing because she kept asking if I was ok to drive. (I must have looked really bad). In the end she sent me to the ER because she was worried about my high temp and high heartbeat (I was 16 months pregnant at the time). She called ahead to the ER so they would expect me. \n\nI'm actually really glad she was so worried about me driving because it scared me enough to call my husband to pick me up.

First attempt was slightly after 9PM on a Friday or Saturday to find they closed at 9.  Seriously, a restaurant that closes at 9 on a weekend is weak.  I know this is Florida, but not everyone is into the early bird special.  And this play is trying to be hip, kind of new-wave sushi, yet they close basically at sunset?  Weird.\n\nSecond time around was better.  First thing you notice about Kelp is how small it is.  I think there are 6-10 tables, and the place gets busy.  There were one or two tables when we arrived, but it filled up.  They also did a tremendous amount of to-go orders.  Point being, if you want a table, it might be a crap shoot.  \n\nWe ordered 3 rolls and my girlfriend got crab rangoons.  Can't tell you about the rangoons, but the rolls were very good.  Like I said, a lot of them are far from your tradition sushi rolls - even in the specialty roll concept, they were a bit far out.  For example, we got the Desert Oasis roll, which has mango and a thai chili sauce.  Sounds strange, right?  I thought I wouldn't like it, but it was actually my favorite.  We also got a Underwater Lake roll, which has boiled shrimp, cucumber, avocado and krab salad - also very good, but again, not very traditional.  Finally, we got a Salt Cove roll, which was spicy shrimp, smoked salmon with jalapeno.  This one I didn't care for, and I've had sushi with jalapeno before and really liked it, but in my opinion, the flavors didn't really go well together here.\n\nSo really, I'm deducting a bit for that last roll, but the others were very good.  And to Kelp's credit, they go light on the rice, heavy on the fish.  Drawbacks to Kelp, besides the size, are the options and prices.  They don't have a very extensive menu - 23 rolls (I think) and some appetizers.  Seems like a lot, but that's maybe 1/2 a sushi menu at other places.  Additionally, they are mostly specialty rolls.  They do not have too many of your regular run-of-the-mill rolls.  Finally, price wise, most of the rolls are over $10.  So if you're looking for your regular $6-$8 sushi rolls, this isn't for you.

I ordered a Beefsteak Florentine (I found it cute they used the Italian word for Beefsteak on the menu), I asked for it RARE, like I made a point of it (it was medium at best). What I got was delivered by the food runner as \"here's your strip steak\", I replied, no I ordered the Beefsteak Florentine and he disappeared only to return with the water who said \"in the back they both come up as the same. My friends, a Strip Steak is NOT the same, Beefsteak Florentine is almost always a T bone, charred on the outside and very rare inside, often but not always served on a bed of arugula. It was also not rare by any way, but as my dinner  guests were into their meal, I did not send it back. Also the meat was served with mashed potatoes which I presume is for the West of I-170 clientele who prefer their food really worked over. My fellow companions ordered the lobster ravioli and shrimp which was very rich which is good but it was just too much. This place should just be more honest about their menu and say its Italian-American fusion for upscale people who like to shop at Sacks Fifth Ave and pay too much for everything(interestingly enough, this place is located in the parking lot of an upscale mall). The service was also not so great, we had to ask for more water for the table and the service in general could only be described as spotty. the bar service was also a bit disappointing, my wife Bellini was closer to an adult smoothie than a Bellini and the waiter seemed to not know what kind of gin the bar stocked.

He complained that the meat was too tough to enjoy but didn't want to complain to the server as the server seemed to be overwhelmed with the large party of ~15. \n\nI've been here enough times to know what to expect and what to order.

Always had impeccable service: attentive, but not overbearing. Had beef carpaccio that was fabulous, salmon salad that was delicious (with leftovers), steak (don't know what it's called) with a wedge salad (iceberg, bacon, bleu cheese dressing) that was over-the-top tasting and after I ate the wedge, could just taste the steak (and it lasted for two other meals).\n\nWhich speaks to economy. I don't necessarily want mongo portions, but if that what is served, I accommodate. And usually I can make something last two more meals. Generally, that gets ridiculous economy for my pocketbook.\n\nTo address the noise issue numerous reviewers have mentioned. I don't know for noise. There have never been problems hearing fellow diners. And we've never been cascaded by other diners' conversations.\n\nTonight I went for dinner, Thursday. No reservation. Seated immediately. Rightly pleasant hostesses -- three at the podium. Ate with two others. We did not get appetizers. Two were drinking alcohol lightly. Service was -- again -- impeccable.\n\n#1 got the penne mediterranean (and got a doggy bag for the leftovers). It looked delicious, and she said it was.\n\n#2 got mushroom ravioli. It looked delicious, and she said it was.\n\nI got the whole roasted chicken ($18). It came with roasted vegetables and crispy potatoes. I opted for a replacement for the starch and was readily accommodated with spinach ( there were many other non-starch options). This bird comes to your table whole with a knife stuck in the backbone, daring you to cut into it. I complied. It was succulent, delicious with crispy skin and juicy. The roasted vegetables were haricot verts, sweet potatoe planks and onions . . . beautiful and tasty. The spinach was baby spinach (I thought it would be like that frozen stuff.) with a hint of garlic and no soupy sauce.\n\nThe meal was incredible. And they packed it beautifully for me to take home, as it was served on a dang platter, and I couldn't have eaten all of it if I'd been an NFL linebacker.\n\nNow, to the bread. The crispy (I guess it's called flatbread.) wafers with all the seeds are wonderful. The other bread served is toothsome and yeasty tasting. You ask for more of bread or butter . . . you get it.\n\nThen dessert. The three of us shared a chocolate lava cake (not really sure what it was named) that was a single-serving round little chocolate-frosted cake topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and drizzled with chocolate sauce. The serving bowl edges were sprinkled with cocoa, and three beautiful raspberries were strategically positioned around the cake. I am totally not a dessert-eater. This cake was scrumptious. And sharing it with two others took off a little of the decadent splurge.\n\nOn a postnote, one of the specials that especially taunted me was an herb-encrusted salmon.", "date": "2010-11-12 05:40:59"}, {"_key": "5149989", "_id": "reviews/5149989", "_rev": "_fNzFzbq--N", "review_id": "dXT8LgsmaUKvvslW91ebSQ", "user_id": "UlWDGR0QrBbdFsVY6ugocw", "business_id": "lj-E32x9_FA7GmUrBGBEWg", "stars": 5, "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 4, "text": "Yes, yes, and more yes.

Cody was so engaged with another table he totally failed to connect with ours. We were 1 of his 2 tables and it took him 20 minutes and a reminder to bring my dining companion a straw. I ordered black bean soup quick arrived with sour cream (not indicated on menu). I advised Cody I did not want dairy and he stated the soup itself also has cream in it.

It is worth noting that Brio does not charge corkage for the first bottle.  The glasses were acceptable.  Our server does need a little work on his cork removal skills.  This is not the first that we have had recently who broke the cork when the cork was in good condition.  They need to learn to be gentle with them until they start to move.\n\nMs T and Ms D had a Tomato Caprese salad that they both liked although the tomatoes were clearly showing that they were out of season and they were stingy with the balsamic.  The portion was very good and they were not stingy with the fresh mozzarella.  Mr D had the Tomato Bisque and I had the Lobster Bisque.  Both were very good.  The lobster version was well flavored and rich, with bits of lobster meat.  I felt it may have been a little over thickened with a roux or another starch, giving it a bit of a slimy texture, but it was not a serious issue.\n\nMs D ordered Veal Marsala and , Mr D had Veal Milanese.  Both were well presented and received solid reviews.  The marsala version was a classic style with mushrooms and Fettuccine Alfredo on the side. The Veal Milanese was topped with cherry tomatoes and white wine caper sauce and had roasted potatoes on the side. \n\nMs T chose the Lobster and Shrimp Fettuccine and I was able to snag a spool of the pasta and can say that it was very nicely sauced.  The sauce was billed as \"spicy lobster\" and it was nice to feel a little heat from what was probably cayenne.  There were flakes of crushed red chile apparent in the dish.  The pasta was properly cooked, there was plenty of seafood and the right amount of sauce.  By that I mean it was not drowned.  Half of this came home with us.\n\nI agonized over the beef, chicken and veal dishes and then veered off course and chose lasagna Bolognese.  I love lasagna and this is as good as I have had in a restaurant.  The flavors were elegant and well developed.  Everything was balanced.  In particular it was not covered with an inch of Bechamel, even better, there was none!  The texture was tender, there was plenty of very finely ground veal in the meat sauce plus sauce Alfredo and mozzarella.  I enjoyed a taste of fennel seed in the meat sauce.  The whole thing went very well with the wine.  It was a huge serving and I also brought more than half home.  \n\nI was not sure what to expect from Brio, given that it is part of a giant chain, but we had a very good experience.  Many people complain about the prices, but I did not find it to be out of line.  Four dinners with soup or salad, wine corkage, coffee and ample servings for about $32 per person is not overpriced.  Also consider that Ms T and I made four nice meals from this.  The only negative aside from the missing corkage skills, was that the place is very noisy.

I thought it was more around $15 or so, at least from when I last ate at Bravo.

I ended up with severe heartburn later on but it was so worth it. The salad had crabmeat and a little tangy lemon flavor to it.

We saw neighbors coming and going, but we kept our distance. \n\nFor $5 you get a cup of froyo and two toppings. For a dollar extra you could get homemade ice cream. Anything homemade captures my attention so I went for it. I got half peanut butter fudge and half salted caramel with butterfingers and reeses pieces for my toppings. Like I said, it was my dinner so I wanted all the calories! It did not disappoint.\n\nThe workers were so friendly and it was a nice treat during this time.

Best part - they're locally owned and operated!\n\nI won a bet with my husband while we were zip lining at Empower Adventures earlier in the day. If you've read my other reviews, you would know without a doubt that winning always equals frozen yogurt.

Sure, it was in the opposite direction of home, but it would be quicker for me to get some creamy goodness.

Parking is a breeze since it is in a giant shopping plaza. \n\nThe shop is on the smaller side, but not uncomfortably so. I got a sample cup and turned to look at the flavors. Their flavor choices were spot on. It was as if they asked me what flavors I like and then poof, there they were. There were Snickers, Reese's Peanut Butter, Brownie Batter, and tons more. They even had my beloved tart. They also have a variety of toppings! No, they did not have my favorite - frosted animal crackers - but they had everything else, so I let it slide. There are a ton of crushed candy bars and nuts. I piled my yogurt high with sugary crumbles. \n\nAs I stated at the beginning of this review, the froyo is only $.46 an oz! My snack came out to a little over $3. That's crazy! Most frozen yogurt places I frequent charge over $.50 an oz. That might seem like a small difference, but when you think about how much froyo I'll eat over my lifetime, it will definitely add up. \n\nThey have ice cream too for those of you who don't want to partake in frozen yogurt (and know that if that is you, I respect you less. Kidding...kind of). They were offering a cookie sundae that almost tempted me.

I tried Rogue 7Hop, but to me it tasted more like 1Hop, so I asked Mr. Mustache (I wish I knew his name!) what to do. He steered me toward the Hop Dragon that they were keeping at bay inside a cask. A cask is a device similar to a keg but typically not refrigerated and the beer is put in without any additional CO2 or Nitrogen for carbonation. In a cask, the carbonation comes from the secondary fermentation and conditioning that occurs within it, and the head of the beer is achieved by way of the nozzle the beer comes from. \n\nAll of this was new to me, and it completely changed the flavor profile of what otherwise would have been a very hoppy beer. The hop notes came through tasting faintly like watermelon with a subtle hop character on the finish. \n\nIn all my visits I've never been steered wrong at the tap room and I'll return again soon, hopefully on a day when I'm just invited to sit in there and leave the shopping to the experts.", "date": "2014-03-10 19:35:48"}, {"_key": "5260222", "_id": "reviews/5260222", "_rev": "_fNzF3ZK--N", "review_id": "H8BEvNxsqct-qRmvjMpYmg", "user_id": "rgSvA65McRv57TwBuEMA6Q", "business_id": "SdZvOwgALlSBt8A0DvVkuQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "The Tap Room at Whole Folds is a sure stop for lunch, beer, and good conversation any day of the week.

On the diet we'd gotten accustomed to the prepared foods bar, which packed a ton of options, but we'd never thought about the Tap Room. Whole Foods knows what goes into their food, so we checked up on some recipes and basically uncovered a treasure trove of tasty goodness we could enjoy and learned about some other incredible deals in the process.\n\nFirst up, wings. A solid entry in the category coated in a tangy sauce with just the right kick. If it's not enough for you, just grab one of the hot sauces and add to it. We loved em so much we've been back at least twice to get them! \n\nSecond, burgers. We tried the bison burger with a romesco sauce and Brie cheese. Ordered medium rare and the kitchen nailed it! They even did it \"protein style\" on my request!\n\nLast, a few amazing deals available pretty regularly in the Tap Room: fresh shucked oysters, wine flights, and $5 cheese plates! The oysters are \"flown\" over from the seafood dept on a bed of ice, and the tap room staff will get you set with horseradish, lemon, and hot sauce so you can slurp em down. They usually have two varieties, and j love to compare, and you can order them in sets of 3! The wine flights happen once a week (I think) and the wine buyer selects the theme and the pours, and examines the flight when you order. The $5 cheese plate is  a mind blowing value! I watched a big piece of herbed goat cheese, crackers, fig jam, and all sorts of other accoutrement land on a beautiful board before friends.

The space is still relatively unfinished, with the walls being 'woven' plywood/OSB, and a big \"Tap Room\" sign.\n\nThe menu was pretty reasonable, and was definitely priced at a more accessible price point than I had expected from Whole Foods.  Wasn't super hungry, so the GF and I split an order of the Smoked Pork Sliders ($9).  Other menu choices included a $9 burger, $9 cheese board, $8 wings, etc.  They also mentioned we could go to the hot food/salad bar and bring that in to eat if we wanted.

Selection is good, as many of their wines and beers are from Cepage Selections as their distributor - taps included a few Shelton Brother's imports, one of New Belgium's Lips of Faith, a Great Basin brew, etc.  Sounds like they'll be rotating taps frequently, as they're mainly serving pony kegs.\n\n I chatted a bit with the tapmaster, who mentioned they were trying to keep things friendly, mentioning Great Basin just down the street, and trying to coordinate a bit with Craft so they wouldn't have the same beers on tap.  Definitely different markets, but makes sense.\n\nOverall, a bright, well-lit space, with decent beers and food.  While I'll most likely stick to Public House, Craft, and Lincoln Lounge for the majority of my 'real' drinking, this seems like the perfect spot for me to hide in while the GF goes shopping in Whole Foods, or if I'm looking for a beer and a quick bite at this end of town.", "date": "2012-07-02 03:13:02"}, {"_key": "5398427", "_id": "reviews/5398427", "_rev": "_fNzG-Qq--c", "review_id": "PD8nA37UVFEsCYu7hWjFpw", "user_id": "DFTYFXMBLiuvxJFz7qStjQ", "business_id": "SdZvOwgALlSBt8A0DvVkuQ", "stars": 4, "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 3, "text": "Finally!

The pork was really salty, and it got a little soggy from the broccoli rabe, so not even popping it in the toasted oven helped. If you order this, I don't think provolone is the way to go.

It's a great place to grab a quick sandwich while you're at the airport. Last month I flew from my home airport in Norfolk, Virginia to Akron-Canton Airport to visit my parents in Ohio. I had a layover in Philly. I lived in Philadelphia from 1986 to 1994 during which time I developed a love for the traditional Philly cheesesteak. As soon as I noticed my flight had a layover in Philly I immediately knew I would have a cheesesteak at Tony Luke's.\n\nAfter landing at the airport I easily located the food court. Tony Luke's has chicken and pork sandwiches in addition to its cheesesteaks. They also offer a breakfast menu but to me there is no choice, it's got to be a cheesesteak and fries. I stepped up to the counter and ordered my cheesesteak the traditional South Philly way with onions and Cheez Whiz, I had them add a little mayonnaise as well. I also ordered French fries and a soda. The order process was quick and easy, the employees were friendly and polite. The kitchen is open so you can watch your order being prepared, no surprises here. \n\nAfter a few minutes my order was ready so I had a seat at a table in the food court and dug right in. I first observed the sandwich was just a tad smaller than what I was expecting but it looked great and tasted even better. The first bite hit my taste buds and immediately set off the pleasure censors in my brain. As the grease ran down my arm I kept thinking that this exactly how a cheesesteak should taste. Everything was properly proportioned and seasoned to perfection. The bread was just right with a little crunch on the outside and a nice soft interior. Most Philly cheesesteak joints use an Amoroso roll but Tony Luke's sources their bread from Liscio's Bakery and bakes it fresh in the store every day. The results are very nice. The roll does not taste the same as Amoroso but is every bit as delicious. On to the natural cut fries. They were spot on, hot and crispy on the outside with a delicious soft center, seasoned just right. The portion size was generous and I ate every last one. Everything was so good that I had the exact same thing on my return trip a few days later. I enjoyed my second visit just as much as the first.\n\nI really don't understand the low rating this restaurant has on Yelp because I found the food quality to be excellent. The cheesesteak was fabulous, the fries were delicious and the service was first rate. Every item is made to order so your food is always hot and fresh. The place was clean and presentable. I will concede the prices are a little steep ($16.92 including tax and Philadelphia soda surcharge for cheesesteak, fries and soda) but that's to be somewhat expected at an airport. Truth be told, I would give them five stars if the prices were a little lower.

I immediately contacted my friend and told her about the place; she was extremely ready to try it as well.\n\nWe ventured into the restaurant at around 7:20 PM. The place is fairly small-- there are only about 3-4 tables. The man who owns the place was incredibly warm, sweet and welcoming. We mentioned that we were newcomers and he immediately wanted to make sure we had a good experience with the food. He asked us for spice preferences and meat preferences for my friend (I told him I was vegetarian from the get-go). The food was made fairly quickly even though there were two parties of four ahead of us. Regardless, the wait time wouldn't make me subtract a star.\n\nThe menu of chaat varieties is extensive; I ordered the veggie chaat (I originally asked for the paneer veggie chaat, but he was out of paneer. Next itme!) The quality of the food was absolutely incredible. The combinations of flavors made each bite exciting and different. The chutneys mixed with the yogurt sauce, the fresh bits of mango pieces, raisins and chick peas and crispy flakes/puris added a cool texture to the dish as well. The play on sweet and savory was so on point. At the end of our meal, the owner told everyone in the restaurant (all tables were full so perhaps about 12 people) that he was heating up gulab jamun (indian sweet) for everyone on the house-- my friend and I were just about to leave and we were so full, but the thought was incredibly sweet and it just added to our experience. Another thing I noticed was that while we were eating, he announced to everyone that he hoped the spices were correct-- he mentioned being able to \"fix it up right away\" if someone had a dish with a spice level that wasn't ideal. So cute! So much appreciation! \n\nThe restaurant also had a huge menu for lassi flavors. I'm not a huge lassi fan, but my friend ordered the Date lassi and really enjoyed it. All the other people in the restaurant ordered a lassi as well, so it is probably a worthwhile choice to complement the chaat.\n\nI paid about $6.50 for my weal, and it was so worth it.

Traditional lassi (a.k.a., \"salted lassi\", or simply, \"lassi\") is a savoury drink, sometimes flavoured with ground and roasted cumin. Sweet lassi, however, contains sugar or fruits, instead of spices.\n\nWell, don't fret if you are picky because there is a mind-blowing combination of flavors here.  Literally a wall full of drink combos. Most the the people came for mango, but I went with watermelon. All I can say was it was cool and refreshing with a slight watermelon flavor and hint of spices.  If you are unsure with what you want and order something you can't stomach - they will gladly make you a new drink.

Things have changed around my old home at 48th and Balto, mostly for the better.

Lucky for me, they were delayed arriving, and I had an opportunity for a long talk with Hasan, the owner/chef/creative genius behind the concept and the counter that is Mood.  I got the $.50 tour, and an autobiography worthy of Horatio Alger. \n\nWhile I had eaten Chaat (pronounced, \"Chart\") before, it had never been like this.  Hasan has taken what is basically a common street food in India and turned it into an adventure in eating.  It comes at you in several dimensions - taste, texture, hardness/softness, shape, spice, food group, color and surprise.  It sat before me the most colorful assortment of edibles imaginable.  I had the Salad Chaat with Chicken, but there was so much happening inside that take out container that the meat was forgotten in the exploration of what was going on with all the reds, yellows, stars, logs, crispies, noodles, dried fruit, nuts, fresh mango, greens, feta cheese, chili sauces, curry notes, etc.  It is difficult to describe all the hyperactivity in that bowl.  Imagine an Indian version of Trail Mix thrown into a salad rather than croutons. If he had tossed in some M & M's I would not have been shocked.  This baby was Buh-Buh-Buh-Bizzzeee!!!\n\nAnd, bottom line, it was awesome. We tried each others dishes, and all were unique and captivating. \n\nAnd, that does not even get into the Lassis.  More than 60 varieties of cool, creamy yogurty, sweetness.  Mine?  A Rose Lassi, complete with Rose Petals! Not just amazing, but fun!

And did I mention the Kheer and Rice Pudding he gave us at the end? \n\nOver the Top!\n\nAs good as Mood Caf\u00e9 is, it is a very small shop.  Four tables with bench seats along the wall and plastic stools for everyone else.  So, not the most comfortable arrangement.

I would be willing to pay more for comfort.  \n\nThe sheer enjoyment of the event (yes, this was more than just a cool meal) kicks the experience into 5 Star territory.

I honestly could not have been any more satisfied with my trip to Mood Cafe, and I have never been more confident with this 5-star review. Everything about my visit was just perfect.\n\nLet's start with just walking into the store. I was immediately greeted by the most pleasant owner of the restaurant. After observing that my friend and I were newcomers, he was so helpful with asking what kinds of flavors and ingredients we each liked so that he could customize the perfect first dish for the two of us. I gave up fried foods for lent, which I thought would be difficult for a chaat dish since the base of the dish is fried strips, but the owner told me that they served salads too, so the no-fried-foods restriction wouldn't be a problem at all. I love when restaurants are this accommodating to customer needs.\n\nI wound up ordering a salad chaat with a mango lassi, and my friend got some kind of beef salad chaat with a strawberry lassi. Since it was our first time at the restaurant, the owner told us that if we didn't like the food, had a better chaat at another location, or thought the food was just \"okay,\" our meal would be free. I've never met another man with better customer service. The chaat itself was just wonderful - a wonderful merriment of spiciness and sweetness, crunchiness and chewiness. I will say that chaat in general has very unique and bold flavor, and it's definitely worth a try if you've never had it before, though it may not be ideal for everyone's tastes. Personally, I love chaat, and this dish was probably one of the best, if not the best, that I've had. I could just tell that all of the ingredients (especially the delicious mangoes and dates!) were so fresh, which made my tummy so very happy.\n\nThe lassis were amazing as well. I was blinded by how many choices of lassi that there were on the board, but I wanted to stick with the classic mango. It was the perfect sweetness, not overpowering, and had just a hint of tartness from the yogurt. The strawberry lassi was wonderful as well - tasted like a healthier and fresher version of a milkshake. I can't wait to come back and try all of the other delicious combinations and flavors of lassi. Mood Cafe also has vegan options (with coconut milk, almond milk, or soy milk), which is great and a must-try in the future for me too. \n\nIf the food itself isn't great enough, the business owner is one of the greatest humans I've ever met. He is so helpful and genuinely nice, and I felt like throughout the course of my meal, I was able to befriend him and hear so many of his wonderful stories. I asked about many of the unique ingredients and flavors found on his menu, and he was so enthusiastic in explaining to me and even letting me try a lot of his ingredients, such as his sweetened rose petals that are found in the rose lassi. Also, after hearing that my friend had never tried any of the desserts in his fridge (rice pudding, carrot halwa, and gulab jamun) before, he gave us samples of each! It was such a nice gesture and so uncommon nowadays in restaurants. It was so refreshing to find a restaurant that I genuinely love going into now.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that I will be back at Mood Cafe, even though it is a trek from Penn's campus.

I refer to the \"H\" people - not homeless, but hipsters. But, just because the hip.... people find merit in a restaurant, shouldn't be held against a restaurant. Admittedly, I have long been challenged in this belief by the places I've given the benefit of the doubt of a trial - but, Mood Caf\u00e9 is one of the rare instances where I concur with the H people.\n\nPhilly seems to have its share of establishments where the owner's personal interaction is both engaging as well as entertaining to watch. The proprietor of Mood Cafe, Hasan Bukhari, takes less than a minute to size up the customer and make the appropriate recommendation - and then a few more to win your heart.\n\nIt's a thoughtful business model. Mood Caf\u00e9 provides dozen of variations on Chaat (traditional savory snack in South Asia often served roadside or by food carts) that go beyond the basic Samosa Chaat, Papri Chaat, and Paani Puri to non-traditional combinations that feature salads and meats. Same is the case with Lassi (yogurt based drink, more popular in summer months in the subcontinent) where you can order beyond the typical salted, sweet, or mango Lassi and select non-traditional flavors like Raspberry, Plum, and Mint. Hasan is thus able to offer considerable variety to customers at affordable price points, and helps them navigate through the extensive menu - then he tops that up by assuring them that if they don't like it, they don't need to pay for it. It's not simply the implied money-back guarantee, Hasan ensures that clients aren't hassled and leave happy even if that entails offering small sized cups of Lassi to crying toddlers who want to drink what their mothers are!\n\nI tried the Samosa Chaat and liked it (4 stars) because it was liberally sprinkled with Chaat Powder as is tradition and was suitably spicy. But, I thought the fusion of flavors was more to the tune of what I see in Indian restaurants as opposed to Pakistani ones (that typically emphasize one flavor in a dish). What won me over (beyond the fact of finally dining at a clean, hygienic Pakistani eaterie!) was that Hasan doesn't simply boast idly on his product - he delivers results. When I asked for advice on which dessert to try: Carrot Halwa or Ras Malaai, he immediately guided me to the Kheer (rice pudding). When I asked: why? He responded that you wouldn't have eaten anything like it before. That was a strong assertion, one that I dismissed internally having tried tens of thousands of versions in life, given my sweet tooth. He laughed and said most versions people have tried (especially at Indian buffets that I am all too familiar with) are simply rice boiled with milk. I couldn't resist the challenge, and while I didn't give him the satisfaction of seeing me eat the rice pudding on the spot - must confess that I was blown away completely when I tasted it. Quite possibly the best version of (sub-continental) rice pudding I've e.v.e.r had.... Solid 5 stars.\n\nSo, go to Mood Caf\u00e9, and say hello to Hasan.

It's a large place (formerly Kim Son) and it's decorated with a nautical theme. When the hostess seats you they cover your table in white butcher paper. We went for the largest combo, The Hangry Combo ($76.99.) We chose King Crab Legs, Shrimp, Mussels, and clams. They boil this with corn on the cob, red potatoes, and sausage. For flavoring we chose the Whole Sha-Bang (mild.) We got a side order of garlic bread to dip in the sauce/boil. They give you a plastic bib, plastic gloves, a seafood cracker, and a seafood sheller and dump the bag of boiled seafood onto the paper covered table for you to figure out. It was so great! We cracked the crab legs, scooped out the clams and mussels, and peeled the shrimp. It was savory and spicy even with the mild seasoning and I like spice. Loved the sausage and potatoes too! The spice and boil made a kind of broth/sauce and it was delicious dipping the garlic bread in it. Next time I'll try the French fries for dipping purposes.

And that's gotta count for something, right?\n\nWhat a lot of the other reviews here don't mention is that, not only is your meal served in a trash bag, but it's brought to your table in a mop bucket. I guess that way they don't run the risk of the bag springing a leak and leaving a trail of seafood-flavored water from the kitchen to your table.\n\nThings get pretty messy regardless. You're given a plastic, small-adult-sized lobster bib and the kind of gloves they use to put together the Big Macs at McDonald's. My little brother didn't bother with either. He said the gloves, in particular, just end up getting in your way, which I did find to be true.\n\nI ditched the gloves after the first few minutes, but I kept the bib on. By the time I was done, it looked like I'd dismembered a rival drug dealer's corpse with a chainsaw in a bathtub in early '80s Miami.\n\nMy little brother wore a black t-shirt, which might be the key here. It didn't appear to be at all messy, but it wasn't because he's especially good at cracking crab shells. At one point, he accidentally tossed what may have been the biggest crab leg in his bag, barely missing the girl sitting across from us.\n\nPresented with a list seafood items, served by the pound, that I could add to my bag, along with corn, sausage and what have you and your choice of seasoning, I went with snow crab legs, crawfish, sausage and corn. It was a good 3 pounds of food, not even counting the corn.\n\nThe fact that they give you two whole crab claws per order leads me to believe that they aren't weighing each individual seafood item on one of those scales drug dealers use. They definitely don't skimp. Very little of a crawfish is edible, and it seems like they might have overcompensated by giving me like 40 of them.\n\nThe only aspect of the meal that seemed truly ridiculous was the sausage. You have to buy at least a pound of it, which is more than a reasonable person should eat in an entire meal, let alone a meal that also includes at least a pound of seafood, an ear of corn and some beer.\n\nFor the seasoning, I went with the whole shebang, which is all of their seasonings (cajun, lemon pepper and garlic) combined. I was told that this was the way to go, and I'm thinking it might be, though I didn't try any of the individual seasonings.\n\nYou also get to select your heat level. Choices include mild, medium and XXX, like, uh, the Vin Diesel movie. I of course went with XXX. For being the hottest seasoning they offer, it wasn't very hot, but it was overly fragrant in a way that might make your nose run, like some Indian dishes.\n\nSuspiciously, my Bud Light longneck had hardly broken a sweat by the time our mop bucket arrived at our table. It takes me six years to boil a pot of water at home. How could they boil an entire bag of seafood in five minutes? Maybe they had some already boiling.\n\nMy crab legs and crawfish seemed like they may have been previously frozen, but they were expertly prepared, despite how quickly they came out. The meat was tender and, erm, succulent. There was enough seasoning in the bag to completely obscure some of the crawfish, but only but so much of it actually penetrates the shell.\n\nThe process of eating crab legs is a pain in the ass even if your hands aren't coated in the mud-like substance that collects in the bottom of these bags. It's even more so here. Also, there's nowhere to dispose of the shells other than right there on the table next to your meal. (The servers take those buckets with them.)\n\nService was inept in a way that, along with the harsh fluorescent lighting, the boombox blaring the uncensored version of Rihanna's Anti and the decor, seemingly rescued from the old Long John Silver's over on Page Avenue, I personally found to be charming, but your mileage may vary, especially given what they charge.", "date": "2017-10-20 03:26:10"}, {"_key": "5084556", "_id": "reviews/5084556", "_rev": "_fNzFxOa--b", "review_id": "PoTFFyYGapoJuVnML1UZTg", "user_id": "RJm5qxSw1Ct5VNrEOg1h_g", "business_id": "jLaPtjlLfRSaoBWIcHcSQg", "stars": 4, "useful": 4, "funny": 0, "cool": 3, "text": "Food: 5/5\nService: 2.5-3/5\nOverall Score: 4/5\n\nA date and I came here the Friday before Thanksgiving around 7pm for dinner. The place was not full, however the restaurant seemed short-staffed to accommodate the amount of guests. There were long waits to be seated (despite only half the tables in the dining room being used), and once seated, we experienced a somewhat long wait for a waiter to greet us (at least 15 minutes went by). Throughout our time there, our waiter was slammed and rarely checked on us with refills, requested items, etc. We had to remind him for things we asked for before receiving them (ie forks, refills, etc) The forks that we received upon request were plastic mind you, so they were practically worthless against the crab legs that we needed them for.\n\nNow, that Negative Nancy has made her appearance, let's invite Positive Polly to the review. The food was great! I ordered off the a la carte menu as my date didn't want to share meal-for-two smh. I had a pound of crab legs, a pound of shrimp, one corn on the cob, and one order of potatoes (a pack of three). I got these with the \"whole shebang\" seasoning and mild temperature. It was all delicious! I especially loved the corn! It was great and well prepared.The mild temperature still had a kick to it. For my drink I had the peach tea, which was really tasty!\n\nMy date had the \"middle\" pre-fixe meal. I don't remember the name of it, but it came with crab legs, shrimp, crawfish, potatoes, sausages, and corn. He got this with the \"whole shebang\" seasoning, and medium temperature. He really enjoyed everything! I had some sausage from his meal and it was delicious! The medium was definitely hotter than the mild, which again was still spicy.\n\nThis was no cheap feast, but it was about what you'd expect for a seafood boil in St. Louis (expect around $30-$40 a person depending on what you plan on adding to it). Now, I'd be remiss if I didn't add that my date was sick the next day with a stomach bug. He told me that he woke up at 5am the next day vomiting and it continued all day. I did not get sick at all. I repeat, I DID NOT GET SICK AT ALL! So I can't say that it was from something that he ate or not. Granted, we ate out of two different boil bags, although I still had a couple crawfish and sausages from his bag and wasn't sick at all. I just thought I'd share that because it was the last meal he ate prior to getting sick.", "date": "2017-11-27 21:37:55"}, {"_key": "5090148", "_id": "reviews/5090148", "_rev": "_fNzFxYm--Y", "review_id": "zXyo_579W27irWbcsGkb7Q", "user_id": "k-vckI6UzvLVZmd_W7WrsA", "business_id": "jLaPtjlLfRSaoBWIcHcSQg", "stars": 5, "useful": 10, "funny": 0, "cool": 5, "text": "My OMG moment.

Didnt get greeted by anyone , saw about 6 people at the bar, so we sat at a high top at the bar area.\n\nWe had two servers this visit, #1 we'll call Moppy cause of the hair, #2 we'll call sneezy cause he was sick. (I love sick people coming to work in a hospitality industry, servig food and rinks to people while sick-grrrr)\n\nSo Moppy comes over asks what we'd like to drink, hubby says \"mmm well not sure what you have\" while trying to see the taps at the bar or a drink menu. Moppy never says anything so we opt for two pumpkin beers we saw on the sign coming in. They were served in warm root beer mugs  @ $6.00 each.\n\nThen we got the complimentary chips and dressing. Have no idea why people rave about these. Ordinary \"homemade\" chips you get anywhere with a watered down sauce that tasted like a combination of Thousand Island and ranch. Not impressive.\n\nI was eyeing the beer cheese soup($3.29) but hubby wanted that so I got a cup of chili ($3.29) so we could taste a bit of each. The Texas chili (which BTW no self respecting Texan would ever put beans in a chili)  was soo hot , as in spicey hot, that I knew my stomach would kick my butt later so I couldn't eat and traded with hubby. I like hot food, but I know this must get sent back over and over cause Floridians don't do heat. The beer cheese soup didn't fare any better, it was watery and bland. The shredded cheese on top had more flavor than this gruel.\n\nSo Sneezy is done flirting with some excoworker that was sitting at the bar and he takes over serving us so Moppy can pick up where he left off with the girl.We opt to switch to another beer as the pumpkins are too heavy and we're finally told what they have and (Here's comes the BEST thing about this place) I find out they have Stella 2-4-1. Amazing, you don't get Stella 2-4-1 anywhere in this town! \n\nAfter another round we opt for food. French dip ($8.99)for me, with added sauteed mushrooms ($1.00) and a fried pork chop sandwich($8.99) for Daddy'o.\nOh the disappointment. The french dip came sans mushrooms which took me a minute to discover as I thought the little black burnt things might have been a remnant of said funghi but no, it was just burnt food. Hubby breaded pork chp was breaded so poorly the breading was pulling away from the chop before he even bit into it. It was dry and the spicy sauce (not spicy) couldn't even assist this fiasco. Both sandwiches were served with \"house seasoned fries\" That has to be a joke. These are straight out of the bag Ore Ida crinkle fries sprinkled with something red with no taste.\n\nAll in all, we found the service to be lackadaisical, the food to be horrendous and the atmosphere bland and boring.

If that was any indication of what's to come, I was excited.\n\nWe started out with a bowl of Texas Chili and it was some of the best chili I've had in a LOOOOONG time -- an explosion of flavor with punch of great spicy heat and big chunks of ground beef. My friend order the Midwest BLT with a baked Sweet Potato and I got the Fried Pork Sandwich with Mac 'n Cheese. Both sandwiches come with the signature spicy sauce on it, but you can request the really hot 7-pepper sauce that Food Network came for... so I got that on the side. The BLT was loaded with delicious bacon (redundant? :-P) and the baked sweet potato was nicely baked and topped in the traditional manner with cinnamon and a bit of butter. The Fried Pork Sandwich was juicy and perfectly seasoned. The spicy sauce gave it a great zing. I put a little bit of the 7-pepper sauce on my sandwich and it definitely added a great deal of spiciness to it, but surprisingly, it also added a whole new dimension to the flavor profile. Many really spicy sauces just add heat without adding flavor, but this sauce does both extremely successfully.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience from start to finish. The service and food were exceptional. I would come back just for the chili... that I'm probably going to have dreams about.", "date": "2012-06-08 14:48:25"}, {"_key": "5247475", "_id": "reviews/5247475", "_rev": "_fNzF29W--R", "review_id": "R7h80xWyyqbRlYx-FUOVfQ", "user_id": "m2Pha_tvYXLNW8gYJ0OdqQ", "business_id": "VZfc50XVwgdCecH4YbGNFg", "stars": 1, "useful": 2, "funny": 2, "cool": 1, "text": "When we walked in we just kind of stood there thinking that we needed to be seated.

The Crab Rangoon - which is served with Thai sweet chili sauce - was a very tasty starter; I wished the wonton ends were less crispy/hard, but I happily ate the center stuffing and it was delicious! \n\nAfter learning from Yelp that the Crab fried rice and Pumpkin Panang Curry were popular entree choices, I decided that I wanted to try both. So I asked the gentleman over the phone if I could order the Pumpkin Panang with chicken and jasmine rice - as well as a side of the crab fried rice (since I really just wanted to try it). Since the menu did not reflect the ability to add side orders, he kindly indicated that he could input a \"half portion\" - which was fine by me. The half portion ended up being HUGE (basically seemed like a full entree serving...just see the picture I uploaded if you're in doubt). \n\nI appreciated Thai 5's flexibility by graciously accommodating my request.  This showed me that their customer service efforts are truly exceptional. He asked if I wanted the regular fried rice or the spicy fried rice. I didn't recall reading about the spicy fried rice on Yelp or on the menu, so I asked for his opinion. He said that the spicy kind is more popular and that it would be good with the crab. As it turns out, I absolutely HATED the spicy fried rice with crab. I took two bites and ended up tossing the whole thing. Rather than discrediting the restaurant for this, I attributed this experience to my personal taste. It was way too peppery and the spices really took away from the taste of egg and other ingredients (an appeal that fried rice traditionally offers). I also wondered if I was more adverse to the seafood aspect of this dish - this was a dish that I just wanted to try, and now I know, the crab spicy fried rice is not for me. \n\nThe Pumpkin Panang with chicken, on the other hand was DELICIOUS! I love that this entree is available year round (since many restaurants only offer Pumpkin flavored entrees during the fall season). This was the first Thai restaurant I have ordered from in Tampa that has offered the Pumpkin Panang flavor. The dish could have been slightly sweeter and the potatoes were too soft to stick my fork into, but the consistency of the sauce and the generous serving of chicken was just enough to satiate my appetite!  \n\nI'll definitely be back with the hopes of trying their coconut rice and more of what Thai 5 has to offer!", "date": "2017-10-02 02:57:47"}, {"_key": "5426847", "_id": "reviews/5426847", "_rev": "_fNzG_Q---N", "review_id": "CtBZOnopPJuip6W-igho7g", "user_id": "s7cUp9ma9h9FYN-fa0FtgA", "business_id": "AODksDNj5mH953cyhUG1Qw", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Drove by this spot way too many times before finally dropping by.

The menu is quite limited, but we were really happy with what we got. As others have mentioned, the star of the show are the quesadillas. It's not like what you think of when you think of a quesadilla. I would never normally go out and order that because it's something you can make easily in five minutes. However, this one was different. It is a fried crispy dough with filling in the far inside (we got cheese and mushroom) and topped with queso fresco and lettuce.

Gag me with the figurative spoon, please!\n\nThat said, I LOVE EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT THIS RESTAURANT!!!\n\nJosh Lawler (ex-Chef de Cuisine at the famous farm-restaurant Blue Hill at Stone Barns in NY) and his lovely wife Colleen have created another one of what Philly does so much better than any other city in the world: an intimate, casual-yet-classy, food-centric BYOB that will undoubtedly be joining the likes of Blackfish, Bibou, Fond and Matyson on everyone's top 10 lists.  In fact, Chip Roman himself highly recommended this restaurant to us (and having been Josh's roommate at Drexel Culinary, Chip also doesn't pass up a chance to give props in the press to his new competition), so it was only a matter of time before our wine group made a pilgrimage here.  Undoubtedly the first of many...\n\nFF is an intimate, ~30 seat BYOB on Pine Street, with fairly easy parking at a couple of lots within a few minute walk.  Inside, it's quite charmingly appointed and hits the sweet spot between casual and formal, making it the perfect places for an intimate romantic dinner, or a casual get together with friends over a good bottle of wine.  All the tables are square, white cloth 2-tops, but they can be arranged to accommodate various size groups, including our spacious table for 8.  In contrast to many tiny BYOBs, FF is actually quite roomy--they could probably have squeezed a table or two more, and there is plenty of room to carry on a private conversation or fit your wine and glasses on the table (excellent Guy DeGrenne stems from France).  I think I had 6 glasses in front of me, without problem.\n\nFF has an interesting, short, constantly changing menu (depending on what they have in; and not having either a fridge or freezer, this is an absolute necessity!) divided up into 3 courses of increasing size, each having 4-6 choices, plus a special or two.\n\nWe decided to make things difficult for the staff and came up with our own tasting menu, having bigger dishes plated into smaller individual portions to share, and changing up the order of things to better match the wines we had brought (I've uploaded photos for all the dishes):\n\nBread: Warm rolls, supposedly Parker House-style (although they look more like a muffin) with a crispy exterior and delicate interior, were spread with perfect, lightly salted homemade butter.  After Bibou, the best butter in Philly.\n\nFirst course: Grilled Spanish mackerel, with shaved fennel, warm citrus vinagrette, pine nuts and grainy mustard.  WOW!  Let me repeat this: WOW!!!  The Beet steak gets all the love, but this was the DOTN (dish of the night).  Quite simple to read it, and seemed like a mish-mash of ingredients, but the sum of the parts was knock-your-socks-off.  Each bite was a different experience, citrus one moment, earthy nuts the next.  A lovely match with the SB.\n\n~Preceded by a 1996 Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Champagne Brut La Grande Dame and served with 2009 Merry Edwards Russian River Valley Sauvignon Blanc\n\nSecond course: Handmade pappardelle with Wyebrook Farm pork shoulder ragu, fennel seed and Parmigiano-Reggiano.  An nice dish, with a good porky flavor to the ragu.  I would order it again, but this was probably the least notable of our courses.  However, the 3 Corners was an unbelievably great bottle of Pinot, massive leather & smoke on the nose, midway between New World and Burgundy, with a long, long finish (WOTN).\n\n~Served with 2005 J. Rochioli Pinot Noir Three Corners Vineyard & 2005 J. Rochioli Pinot Noir Little Hill\n\nThird course: Josh's signature dish of bloody beet steak, with yogurt, shallots, pan drippings, aged balsamic and amaranth.  Yes, this is worthy of being a signature dish, with a rich, meaty texture and flavor that prompted us to move it back in the lineup and pair it with a couple of Chateauneuf-du-Papes and a cab (I think the latter was the best match).  But, sorry, I still think that mackerel was The Man!\n\n~Served with 2004 Clos de Papes Chateauneuf-du-Pape & 2003 Domaine du Pegau Chateauneuf-du-Pape (didn't catch the bottling) & 2002 Dominus Napanook Red.  The Pegau was a very fine wine with lots of saddle leather and barnyardy hay on the nose.\n\nFourth course: Rare New York venison with farmer's cheese spaetzel.  This was apparently a entree special for which there were only two plates left, so we split a slice each.  Perfectly tender, perfectly rare, on crispy/chewy spaetzel.\n\n~Served with more of the 3 reds above.\n\nOK, running out of space, so click the link below for Part 2 of my review:", "date": "2012-03-05 00:35:39"}, {"_key": "4793304", "_id": "reviews/4793304", "_rev": "_fNzFcCa--_", "review_id": "1RbEQsnFgMNR25TcLvKnSA", "user_id": "Il9EB1SLBALhvp7GOVMokw", "business_id": "K8b2MQ5Az59-nzvqUfjJEQ", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Lovely farm-to-table spot that does BYOB. \nDelicious menu - we struggled to do not order everything.

I love the fact that the menu didn't make me feel like I should run out and go on a liquid detox diet (everything was lightly prepared and flavorful), but a few things (i.e. the fish) could have really used some salt..\n  As for the dessert. Lets hope the yogurt panna cotta (weird) was replaced. Even our waiter noted that we barely took a bite out of this strange concoction, and was kind enough to deduct it from the bill.

The hamachi crudo was amazing as well - the orange juice perfectly highlighted the natural sweetness of the fish, and the fish itself was velvety and incredibly fresh.

The lamb was incredibly tender and the preserved blueberries provided the perfect tangy accent. The chicken baked in hay was good, but unfortunately, we could not taste the sweet, grassy flavor supposedly imparted into the chicken by the hay; that delicate flavor may have been overpowered by the curry and all-spice that flavored the vegetables.\n\nThe desserts were both excellent - I loved the decadent, slightly salty taste of the chocolate napoleon, but the more mellow panna cotta was lovely as well.\n\nThe chef has a lot of creativity and really knows how to make local ingredients sing.

I had specifically requested that restaurant because it was at the forefront of the whole 'farm-to-table' concept, which was relatively new at the time. It was one of the best meals we had had in NYC, so simple and yet the flavors were remarkable. When I heard about The Farm and Fisherman opening up where Paul used to be, and more importantly that the chef was of Blue Hill fame, I really really REALLY wanted to try them out asap.\n\nI mentioned it only once to my bf, and when my birthday approached he announced that dinner reservations were already taken care of and 'it was a surprise.' I love surprises, but I was a little wary - not that he chose a bad place, but I assumed it wasn't The Farm and Fisherman because my own little sleuthing had turned up zero available reservation times there - until 3 weeks later. Imagine my ecstatic surprise when we arrived there.\n\nThe interior has been transformed since Paul, and the warm, intimate vibe is perfect for the space. It's very small, which is one reason reservations are hard to get, and perhaps a bit close quarters but the food makes you forget about anything else. And since it's BYO, everyone arrives with their drinks and proceeds to enjoy them as much as they do the food.\n\nIt was a tough call, but we started off with their Kirby Cucumber Soup (Buttermilk, sour gherkins, chocolate mint), which was creamy and refreshing, and the Smoked Rainbow Trout (Bacon, pea puree, spicy cress, bachelor's buttons), a dish that we agreed was the best smoked trout we'd ever had (yep, better than Telepan). I'm not a big lamb eater, but my bf really wanted to try the entr\u00e9e because it was seasonal and I have to say that the Braised Lamb Shoulder (New potatoes, Poblano pepper, merguez), had wonderful complementary tastes that built in flavor with each bite. I personally preferred two 'second courses' for my entr\u00e9e and ordered the Stuffed Quail (Smoked zucchini, apricots, pistachios) and Poached Jennings Farm Egg (Peas, hazelnuts, patty pan squash, pancetta, morels). The quail was fantastic - it's only half of one, but the apricots it's stuffed add a nice sweet-tart flavor to the game hen. My bf initially questioned my choice with the egg, but one bite shut him up. It's the best dish we ordered, and such a wonderful surprise. The poached egg sits in a semi-stew of fresh peas (seriously, the freshest I've ever had EVER), patty pan squash chunks, morels, roasted hazelnuts and the lingering smokiness of pancetta. It's a party on the plate AND in your mouth - the combination of colors, flavors and textures created an absolutely unforgettable dish. I couldn't have asked for more - and almost couldn't finish it! We had a lot of food, so unfortunately dessert was out of the question, but I really didn't care.

There was a pea shoot garnish which I asked about to make conversation with the waiter; this turned into another \"everyone-in-the-restaurant-hears\" debate between the servers and the chef.

Sashimi-grade quality, and a good portion with just the right amount of sweet garnish with the dish\n\nStriped Bass (4/5) -- These guys know how to cook a fish.  Tender on the inside, just a touch of crispness on the outside.  Served with purple cauliflower, regular cauliflower, and...potatoes!  Light on the sauce, so I did not feel like a blob after eating.

She made my visit very enjoyable. \n\nAs soon as I saw the innovative brunch menu, I was torn between ordering two small plates and a dessert, or one main dish and a desert. Rachel gave me her opinion on different items on the menu, and I literally wanted to order everything. I decided not to contain myself and get one main dish: Chicken Roasted in Hay (brilliant & delicious,) and a dessert ( was something with strawberry & mascarpone whipped cream.) After enjoying few sips of my first coffee of the day, Rachel returned to my table with a small plate of Ricotta Crostini as a compliments of the chef. (Astonishing, I know!)\n\nHow many times have you gotten psyched about some delicious farm-to-table food, that you just couldn't forget the tasty difference?!\nFarm and Fisherman, even when you close down, you'll always be one of my favorites.\n\nFour and half Yelps.", "date": "2016-05-20 03:19:48"}, {"_key": "5308422", "_id": "reviews/5308422", "_rev": "_fNzF7LK--W", "review_id": "woTTw_5khZbAzTlnwIpk9w", "user_id": "evxG8WxjD7r0Z7XIjXWHmQ", "business_id": "K8b2MQ5Az59-nzvqUfjJEQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "The farm and fisherman and their bloody beets steak were on the top of my must-have list in Philadelphia.  It took some effort, but I was able to secure a table of 5 with my girlfriends on a Sunday night.  Please make a reservation if you decide to come because this restaurant is small.  It has about 10 tables, very minimalist with a feel of intimacy.  The only complaint I have is the lack of a hostess when my party entered.  Although they were around and about, no one took the initiative to approach us.  Our evening did get better from that point, so it's a non-issue.\n\nWe ordered two of the famous bloody beets steak to share.  This was only my second time trying beets but it made me an instant beets lover!  Now, if only I can have the recipe so I can make my beets like that every time.  That's what the dish does to people.  Even those who hate beets would change their mind.  Oh, it isn't so bad after all.  The yogurt and bulls blood (seriously?) were perfectly harmonious with the beets.  It was sweet and a bit tangy.  Just the right amount of sauce and god, the wonderfully well-cooked beets!  I can't imagine anyone would say this often.\n\nThe second course was the Stuffed Rhode Island Squid with chorizo, a special of the day my server mentioned.  It came with two, perfect to share, and the chorizo and Valencia rice were gooooood.  Chewy squid and soft interior.  It was a delicious combination.  The main course for myself was the stuffed trout.  I was worried that it would be an overkill on \"stuffed\" type of dishes but my server assured me that they are not the same.  I can't decide which I liked more, the stuffed squid or stuffed trout!  The stuffed trout had kale and bacon bits inside with crispy, chewy skin on the outside.  Not to mention, the farm and the fisherman makes the best sauce to compliment their dishes.\n\nI was honestly very happy with my choice - in restaurant and the dishes.  It is currently the best overall meal I've had in Philly (and I've definitely been eating well..thank you Philadelphia and your never ending list of good eats!)\n\nBy the way,  I made the reservation on yelp!!

Obviously, I like that in a server! We started out with delicious parker rolls - it was all I could do to not wolf the entire thing but I was trying to save my cals for the rest of the meal. \n\nJosh Lawler does some really incredible things with seasonal ingredients. This was showcased especially in the first course: grilled eggplant with burrata, and a slow roasted squash. Both plates were filled with vibrant colors from the ingredients and accompanying sauces. The flavors were wonderful, and every bite was different. \n\nNext I had scallops, which were served with pastrami and sweet corn. On point. Now that it's a couple weeks later, I don't remember what my dining partner had for his second course, but I do know he enjoyed whatever it was (helpful, I know). \n\nMy main course was a grilled tri tip steak, which was very lean and very tender. It was served with lima beans, which I really liked as an alternate to the usual potato. My boyfriend enjoyed his bacon-wrapped quail. Who wouldn't love a teeny bird wrapped in bacon? \n\nFor dessert we shared a lemon tart which was perfection. I'm literally shaking my head at the memory. Get the tart.\n\nThis was our second visit to this restaurant. The first was nearly a year ago, after they first opened. I have to admit, I enjoyed this second visit so much more, and I think it had a lot to do with the seasonal fruits and veggies of late summer.

They used the lightest pressure on me! Once both services were finished, we decided to shower and enjoy the rest of our time enjoying the \n salt rooms. For those of you unfamiliar with Korean spa rooms, they are supposed to be heated. However, both rooms to the crystal salt rooms were wide open..\nWe ventured inside to a cold and dark room. Not how it's supposed to be! Apparently, they were getting ready to close (early) and had turned everything off! Unacceptable. With 45 minutes before their scheduled closing time, this was a bit surprising, not to mention disappointing.\nThey also provide zero amenities for purchase. Most Korean spas have razors, slippers,towels, face masks, additional add-ons to make your stay pleasant. None of that was found here.. only hairdryers.\nSo basically, We paid $175 each to get a body scrub to take two showers and sit in a steam room.

I've been to bath houses in LA & SF (both Russian & Korean) but didn't know we had one in NE Philly.  \n\nI went on a Thursday afternoon at 2PM and they didn't have the next body scrub appointment until 4PM.  I didn't think I'd want to soak in the baths or hang out in sauna/steam rooms for 2 hours by myself so I booked a massage for 2:30 which worked perfectly because you need to soak for 10 minutes before body scrub.  So I'd recommend booking an appointment ahead instead of showing up and thinking you can get an appointment in right away.  \n\nIt was $140 for a body scrub and shiatsu massage (hey - sometimes you just need to treat yourself!). I should've got the $100 scrub and massage package but she was making it seem like only the shiatsu massage was available - who knows.  The women at the front did speak English. Body masseuse was fully clothed and massage was in a private room(I read reviews where people didn't feel comfortable about being naked in front of other women or masseuse being half naked). Body scrub is behind a wall in bath area - there are 3 tables back there; no one was back there when I was scrubbed and I didn't feel all out in the open.\n\nIt seemed like a lot of the bad reviews on here were people getting chastised about tips.  \n**All prices include gratuity as of now.**\n\nDaypass admission is $25 and includes the 3 temperature pools (cool, warm, hot), sauna room, steam room, gym, and hot stone rooms (hot yellow clay and hot jade stone).  There's also a dead sea salt room in co-ed lounge where you wear your robe inside (in same sex areas its nude in sauna/steam room and tubs and you change into shirt/shorts for hot yellow clay and hot jade stone rooms). \n\nThere were only 2 other girls in the tubs when I got there, which was nice.  Some more people seemed to trickle in but there were never more than 5 people in the tub/bathing area when I was there.  There were some loud talkers and a grandma did bring a child but maybe other days it may be more quiet. \n\nHow it works:\n- You pay at front desk. They give you locker key, robe, bath towel, hand towel (which I used when sitting in sauna).  \n- Can put shoes outside of locker room but says it recommends you putting them in locker as they aren't responsible for stolen property.  I think you are supposed to take shoes off before entering locker room\n- Change into robe (get naked) and put clothes in locker\n- Walk into bath house\n- Shower before entering tubs/sauna/steam rooms.  There's shampoo & conditioner (pink bulk but put into tresume and other brand bottles) but no soap? (3 tubs - cool, warm, hot)\n- Soak for 10 min if getting body scrub\n- Wait for them to call YOUR LOCKER NUMBER when it's time for your appointment (I had an appointment at 2:30 and kept looking around for whoever was supposed to come grab me so I continued to shower.  I walked out into locker room and I guess they wait out there?) I thought she was saying the time of my appointment and I just shook my head yes\n\nBody Scrub (women is in bra & undies - see website for pic if feel uneasy)\n- Face Up: She scrubs your body from neck to feet at least 5x\n- Face Down: Scrubs neck to feet\n- Side: this position was a bit awkward\n- Other Side: ...\n- Repeat process again, but this time it's faster and with soap\n- Little massage at end - best part\n- Washes hair\n*Actually best part was them pouring buckets of hot water over body every time they finish a side\n\nHot Stone Rooms require provided undersized shirt and oversized shorts (I was looking for a medium but grabbed a large and seemed like I was wearing a little girls size Large*).  Hot Jade Stone Room is 98 degrees; you can be in there unlimited amount of time and stone contains Ca, Fe, and Mg which is good for people who have high blood pressure and diabetes. Hot Yellow Clay Room is 120 degrees (3-15 min limit) and is said to exert sebum and other impurities, increase blood circulation, kill common cold virus (though may not want to advertise that and have a bunch of sick people), good for arthritis and decrease stress level.  These rooms didn't seem that hot to me and seemed more like yoga rooms - a good place to meditate/rest.  \n\nWhat to remember for next time:\n- flip flops/shower shoes\n- face mask would be nice\n- if not getting body scrub, bringing own exfoliating mitt might be cool\n- soap (you do get soaped at end of body scrub but when I first got it, I thought it was weird they tell you to shower before getting in hot tubs and theres no soap - but there is shampoo and conditioner).\n\nImprovements:\n- Hooks for robes/towels\n- Soap in bathing area", "date": "2017-10-26 21:40:59"}, {"_key": "5265994", "_id": "reviews/5265994", "_rev": "_fNzF3m---E", "review_id": "spXK2XPULXgF97Ih7exjAQ", "user_id": "Um5bfs5DH6eizgjH3xZsvg", "business_id": "zK2mxCWqqmjvtElDGEnkOw", "stars": 4, "useful": 2, "funny": 3, "cool": 2, "text": "Typical walgreens.

And so did the 20 people in front of and behind us.\n\nThe one aspect that was clear from the start was how understaffed this place is. There was one student at the front taking orders and making desserts, and on a Sunday night, with about 20 people out the door, that really piles up. After a 10-minute wait, another girl walked in (perhaps she was on her break with an hour left before closing?) and lazily began refilling the DIY fro-yo toppings bar. Hey, your co-worker is wildly swamped at the front and there's no one in line for chocolate chips. Start making egg waffles, or something!\n\nThat being said, the sweet blonde girl running the shop really did an excellent job of staying on task and keeping it cool. There were several things out of her control that this place really has to improve on if they care about making their customers happier. The staffing issue is one. Another was that the scooped ice cream was super icy. I'm talking \"finding ice pockets in the cream\" icy. Fro-yo might be a better bet, so stay away if you don't want to shock your molars every time you chomp down. Management should also consider paring down the menu (cold brew nitro coffee! Egg waffles! Sago soup! Acai bowls! Sour cherry gummy coke bottles!) to maintain quality control.\n\nAll that said, the egg waffle was just okay. Too dense for my liking. It wasn't strawberry season, so the fresh sliced ones on top of my sundae were kind of sour, but the presentation was pretty. What else can ya say for $5.95?", "date": "2018-01-30 01:58:37"}, {"_key": "5381254", "_id": "reviews/5381254", "_rev": "_fNzF9rO--I", "review_id": "EOMwcTCnBFhDOgzhCVEnlg", "user_id": "clirF7pph8EPEoMtvrcj0w", "business_id": "F3dxQiOwN55rSLw-BNSq6A", "stars": 5, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This place is an addiction.

This location is nice and cozy, offering a few booths, standard tables and some countertop seating. We prefer to sit at a booth, but if one isn't available we just set up shop at the counter with a few coffees until one opens up. \n\nThe food is prepared in an open kitchen area behind the counter, so you get to see and smell all the amazing things they're cooking as you peruse the menu.

It is easily the most delicious chicken fried steak I have ever eaten, covered in white country gravy and served up next to a side of eggs, hashbrowns and a biscuit. Matt usually gets the dinner version, which comes with mashed potatoes or french fries, a side salad, a vegetable and garlic bread. I love that you can substitute anything on your plate without it being a huge issue; sometimes Matt will get a biscuit instead of garlic bread or I will get fries instead of hashbrowns. Matt has also gotten the Philly cheese steak sandwich, and it is definitely one of the best in the Metairie area. \n\nAlso, the biscuits here ARE LIFE. I have never ever ever Ever had a better biscuit in my life. TBH, I think you could justify going to Dots just for the biscuits alone. Get them.\n\nLast, but certainly not least, is the service.

Our johnny cakes arrived with our dinners rather than before as an appetizer, as we had requested. The food was quite delicious, but also quite pricey.

Andre, the sharply dressed man that greeted us, is actually the owner, and he does a great job as a host, making each person that walks in feel special.  His entire demeanor is very calm and pleasant, and I was caught off-guard, because I have become a hardened Miamian that does not experience this often, unless there is an ulterior motive.\n\nThe music was fun, and energetic, and Andre had such a peaceful, happy energy about him that it permeated throughout his restaurant.  You couldn't help but feel happy while you were in the establishment.  The food options were plentiful and all sounded delicious, but my friend and I stuck with the safe choice of jerk chicken, which came with a salad and rice and peas.  We each decided to get a large, dinner portion, but had no idea it would be so much food! It was certainly enough to share, though to be fair, we had also had some delicious jerk chicken wings to start.  I had a watermelon soda, which satisfied my sweet tooth, and was very refreshing.  The chicken was very tender and tasty, and the wings especially were hot and spicy, just as we had asked.  It's great to find food that is well-seasoned, and that does not mean that it is dripping in salt.  On the contrary -- it means other flavors and spices dominate, with salt taking a backseat.  We were also told the ingredients were all locally sourced, and organic. \n\nWe were checked on constantly, to make sure we were happy.

I kicked up the rice and peas with pineapple pepper sauce, which gave it much-needed flavor. My companion, who feels vegetables are what Kryptonite is to Superman, gave me a side salad, which was fresh and delicious.

Not a second passed that someone wasn't checking on us to make sure we had everything we. needed. The owner works out in the front and he is friendly and speaks to everyone- very nice and talkative. His wife is the chef and she came out to assure me what items were free of gluten. I can not wait to return here! Our bill was either about 75$ or 100$ before tip- that was with 3 cocktails. Very affordable. The gluten free jerk chicken, oxtails, curry goat, and rice and peas were perfect. They had the right amount of spice and saltiness. They reheated the same the next day. They give you a lot of rice so I actually reheated that a few times and every time it tasted the same.

I'm so glad I did!\n\nMy wife is very pregnant - anything remotely spicy is basically like setting off a bomb inside her esophagus, so she decided to sit this one out. Enter: my friend Nick S, who is almost as beautiful, inside and out, but with a non-pregnant stomach like a steel trap and a can-do attitude. He was happy to sub in as my date for the evening.\n\nAnd speaking of dating, this was quite the romantic venue. I was surprised to see the white tablecloth setting when we walked in. It's especially surprising, given that this restaurant is somewhat hidden in the back of a UPS Store, next to a Walgreens. But that's why Yelp is awesome -\u00a0it spotlights, quite literally, a \"hidden\" gem like this one.\n\nAs for the food, we started off by sharing a beef patty and a chicken patty. The chicken patty had some kind of curry flavor to it, where the beef patty almost tasted like an empanada. I preferred the beef, but both were tasty!\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the oxtail and it was absolutely epic. The phrases \"melts in your mouth\" and \"fall off the bone\" are overused cliches, but combining those two together is the only way to accurately describe this dish. The meat would melt off the bone and dissolve in your mouth. After one bite, I knew that my review would be 5-stars, just based on the oxtail alone!\n\nFor those who have not had oxtail before, it was served in a bowl with some kind of dark broth. There were several bones, with small pieces of tender, delicious meat hanging off of them. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to eat this with a fork or with my hands, so I basically just kind of did both. It was a bit messy, but worth every second of digging through that delicious broth.\n\nTo drink, I ordered a virgin Island Paradise, which was like some kind of mango/strawberry daiquiri. If you like frozen drinks, you'll definitely want to order this one. \n\nThe folks working here could not have been nicer, and of course, Nick S knew all of them because he's the Mayor of Platt Street. He's come a long way since his days in Hudson, but that's what happens when you marry royalty like Tina.\n\nBravo to Yah Mon - your amazing rating is well-deserved!", "date": "2018-11-13 14:10:14"}, {"_key": "5353024", "_id": "reviews/5353024", "_rev": "_fNzF8si--F", "review_id": "G8wayN8VL_ShzRnJetMnyQ", "user_id": "Br7NfAxcRprDceabsyxZNg", "business_id": "w0lcP2ngFaUpBGi5yzlYDw", "stars": 4, "useful": 16, "funny": 11, "cool": 16, "text": "Island food with island hospitality.

My Aztec is hard to describe, but I like it.  Mix of chicken, cheese, taco-sauce like spice, bacon (that I couldn't really taste - so that was a bit of a downer).

Gigs at two big ole ice cream chains really ruined my taste for the stuff, but I know a taste sensation when it smacks me in the taste buds. \n\nHere's the other truth: Everyone I've dated in the last 5 years is an absolute fiend for ice cream. I brought a date to Creole Creamery weeks after moving to New Orleans to try and cheer up my blue little love, and it worked. I was an instant hero. The case of just chocolate flavors (6 + chocolate in the hidden case) was a major selling point, especially because the chocolate flavors CHANGE. There is always something new and lovely to try in that case, which sold pretty much everyone ever. \n\nMy present love is all about the ice cream to the point that it's a separate food group. A visit to Creole Creamery was a little overwhelming (\"Suzanne, there are too many choices!\") but won me a fair amount of acclaim because everything that we tasted was fab. The mini samplers are really great because it's easy to get lost in all that ice cream if you don't have One True Love for each visit. Not too many other ice cream places in this world will do a sampler with just a few bites for the picky, indecisive, and expansive among us. \n\nMy favorites are usually Creole Cream Cheese (which is subtle so don't expect it to dazzle after eating three mini-scoops of super sugary peppermint or whatever), any sorbet that contains the word \"pear\" in the title, and the chocolate-orange flavor. (It seems to change names. That or I forget what it's called between each visit.) The pear thing seems odd, but this is true: the texture of the sorbet is the same as the texture of the flesh of a beautifully ripe pear. I am completely enchanted by that trick of sorbet making. \n\nYes, it's cash only. Yes, it's a PITA sometimes. But there is a charm to something so quaint. (Plus, being cash-only keeps me from dropping by more often for that pear sorbet. This is probably a good move.) \n\nAccessibility notes: door opens out. No Braille menu or signage. High counter.

Creole ranks with the greatest on this front, and if you cream yourself for creameries like Bi-Rite in San Francisco, Scoops in Los Angeles, Cones in New York, and Molly Moon's in Seattle, then you should put this place on your list.\n\nThe interior is very cute, with lots of photographs and phrases like \"Eat Ice Cream\" and \"Be Happy\" decorating the walls.  The service is friendly and generous with the samples.  I tried a ton of flavors before getting the mini sampler, perhaps defeating part of the purpose of that sampler, and most of them were pretty great.\n\nAll of the ice cream has a wonderful tuggy consistency and a creamy richness.  The base ice cream is sold as its own \"naked\" flavor, and it's really good, milky and not too sweet.  I like that they're proud of their base, and the quality of the product shines through in every flavor.\n\nLike I said, I got six mini-scoops, which was a fair amount of ice cream but not too much, even coming off of two giant lunches.  For my six flavors, I chose creole cream cheese, red velvet, banana cane malt, coffee pecan brittle, peanut butter fudge, and Abita strawberry chocolate.   The creole cream cheese was my favorite, with a flavor like cream cheese but tangier, even a little bit sour.  The red velvet was so good and it actually tasted like the cake, rather than vanilla mixed with cake crumbs.  The banana cane malt tasted strongly of banana with an equally strong malty flavor, and the result was balanced and deep.  Coffee pecan brittle was as good as it sounds, nicely textured and very tasty.  Peanut butter fudge was a more adult flavor than you might imagine, very dense and dark with just a subtle layer of peanut butter.  The most out-there flavor was the Abita strawberry chocolate, and I would definitely recommend it.  Abita is the local Louisiana beer, and the flavor was prominent but mixed well with the strawberry and chocolate, both of which were also easily discernible.  My boyfriend got a scoop of the French vanilla, and this was a simpler flavor that was also quite good.  For some reason, it tasted vaguely of coconut.\n\nI swallowed my six little scoops with ease then crawled in the back of our rental car and lay down like a beached whale.

The Mexican Hot Chocolate is a favorite of mine because it combines sweet dark chocolate with spices like cayenne pepper.

It reminded me of those orange chocolate balls that you smash on the table and they open up into orange segments. \nThe boyfriend, of course, asks the staff if they have plain chocolate. They're confused for a second about why anyone would want plain chocolate when they've created all of these other amazing concoctions, but then serve him some with a smile. \nTo compliment my chockwork orange I add on some pumpkin cheesecake. Creole Creamery does make a plain cheesecake flavor but it was the first day of October so I had to go with the pumpkin. It was creamy and just the right blend of the two flavors. \nOther flavors like the oatmeal cookie with molasses is heavenly. If you're looking for something original try the lavender honey- at first it's a little like soap- floral and not something your palate is used to- but it really is good. Try it!

Any trip to my bank involves a trip across the street for ice cream, which is pretty much officially the only reason to bank with Chase by the way. I think their ATM machine is the official enabler for Creole Creamery.\n\nLook, there are Cold Stones out there, and Pinkberries, and then of course your Ben & Jerry's and your Haagen-Dazs, and your classic 31 flavored Baskin-Robbins, but Creole Creamery is in a class of its own. Scratch that. It didn't even go to school with those others. While they were in class, Creole Creamery was in their homes playing hide the waffle cone with their moms.\n\n31 flavors? Creole Creamery sees your 31 and raises you 3100 gajillion billion. Then it winks at you and leans back, not even caring if you think it's bluffing with a made-up number. It's Creole muthafuckin' Creamery and it'll take your cash money either way. If you want to keep your green, you're sitting at the wrong table in a casino you just aren't ready for.\n\nRemember that episode of Seinfeld where they fell in love with the non-fat yogurt place? Well if you say you're sorry you can't, well you can just stuff your sorries in a sack, Mister! Creole Creamery dares you to compare it to anything non-fat, while flashing Newman for beads... Newman!!\n\nHere, look at some of these flavors they've concocted thus far:\n\nAvocado w/ Mint & Sour Cream\nBanana & Brown Sugar Cheesecake\nBlueberry Maple Pecan\nButtered Lemon & Pine Nut\nButterscotch - Pumpkin Bundt Cake\nCandied Bacon & Cinnamon\nCayenne Lime Butter\nChocolate Pineapple Chip\nCreole Cream Cheese w/ Wild Blueberry - Pecan Cornbread\nDark Chocolate w/ Coconut & Fresh Mint\nGorgonzola & Toasted Walnut\nHoneydew w/ Ricotta & Pistachio\nHoneyed Pear w/ Goat Cheese\nLavender-Pecan Chocolate\nOrange Peel Ginger Cheesecake\nPeach w/ Champagne & Mint\nSmoked Gouda\nStrawberry Jalapeno Cheesecake\nSweet Corn w/ Cracked Pepper & Raspberry Coulis\nSweet Potato Sassafras Praline\nVanilla-Bourbon w/ Brown Sugar\nWhite Chocolate Bread Pudding\n\nI know right? It's like you're pretty sure you just smoked something green and leafy just reading that list. And that's only a fraction of them. Don't deny yourself the experience of a visit to Creole Creamery. And definitely don't go with just Vanilla. That's like going to Paris and eating dinner at McDonalds. That's a pimp-slappable offense on all 7 continents by the way.\n\nBasically, you can't go wrong with this place. Taste the rainbow and Skittles be damned.

While not a fan of red velvet cake, I can't deny this ice cream brings it to a whole new level. Instead of being merely red velvet flavored ice cream, it's got bits of red velvet cake throughout. Scream-worthy, right?\n\nSecond visit, I came with a mission: to try four flavors via the 4 scoop sample (you get 4 small scoops for $4. A bargain, no?) My choices: sweet corn with raspberry and black peppercorn, Green Fairy, butterscotch butter pecan, and blueberry pie, my favorites being the latter two, however I wouldn't throw the other two out of bed... I mean the bowl. Green Fairy wins the creative award because I'd never think to have absinthe-flavored ice cream! It also has bittersweet chocolate and orange peels, which make for a really tasty, unique concoction. My only issue is that I'm not a fan of chocolate bits in ice cream, otherwise, I'd be all over this. Butterscotch butter pecan brings a bit of a more intense, grown up twist to an old timey classic (I had to wonder if there's booze in it). Blueberry pie... sigh. Just perfect. I need a moment alone with it. Perhaps even a year. The sweet corn is a bit too overpowered by the peppercorns and could stand to have more raspberry, in my opinion. That's the *only* criticism I'd have. With all those flavor choices, who cares? Oh and feel free to sample if you're on the fence (but obey the sign: don't be a sample hog).\n\nThe best thing about this ice cream is that it's not crazy sweet. I realize that sounds ridiculous, but it's true. Take the salted caramel, for example (I know you will). I tried my friend's and was quite taken with it. I love the idea of salted caramel but I've had that flavor before at other places and found it sickeningly sweet- not at all salty. Creole Creamery has somehow managed to achieve just the right balance of flavor.\n\nAnd so, I bid Creole Creamery farewell... meaning in this review. Already planning what flavors I'm going to try next visit. Hey, it's ice cream season, don't you know?", "date": "2012-05-24 21:49:40"}, {"_key": "5164305", "_id": "reviews/5164305", "_rev": "_fNzF0EK--W", "review_id": "JMXTJe00AqNpybP2fLZNbA", "user_id": "1ArdBetF-pM3Y4eP1pgNPA", "business_id": "AzseSGgDC6bVtMPEYo1CNQ", "stars": 3, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "After seeing this on the Food Network, I knew I had to try it.

I was expecting it to be creamier than it was. I thought that the flavors weren't complex and didn't last too long on the palate. It was icey rather than creamy.  I had some other ice cream in the NOLA area that tasted the same, so either Creole Creamery supplied them, or that's just the Louisiana way of making ice cream.  Either way, I feel like it I go back I would end up putting a cup of chocolate sauce on my sundae to get some real flavor.

On my drive there, I went through various neighborhoods, road constructions, and even smaller food stores nearby. On my arrival, the place was hidden amongst a long narrow street with cars parked left and right. If you're looking for some excellent parking, park at the CVS Pharmacy right next to the place, and you'll be able to enjoy a short walk there!\n\nAnyways, let's move on to the actual review! Well, I wanted the best bang for my buck, so I went for the six scoop (mini-sampler) for only $7.00 FLAT! Cash only! Not really too big of a deal for me, and I even left a tip seeing as the woman at the counter provided me with excellent customer service in regards to explaining the various items on the menu to me and offering samplers along the way! \n\nAfter shuffling through all the flavors, I narrowed it down to these six:\n\nHoney Lavender: \nRating: 4.2/5\nThe honey lavender wasn't too bad, as with a majority of their ice cream, this one was really smooth. Best enjoyed eaten inside, because if you're going for a six scoop, the heat's going to melt your ice cream pretty quickly and soon enough you'll have ice cream soup! The flavor was definitely on point, it wasn't heavy, but rather faint. Additionally, it wasn't too sweet, but in between, you'd be able to taste the lavender more than anything else!\n\nCreole Cream Cheese:\nRating: 4/5\nWhenever you get the ice cream, there will be small pieces of cream cheese inside, not an overload of it! That's just the way I like it! The name for me was somewhat off putting in that I'm not a big fan of cream cheese, but at least the ice cream was delicious. The bits and pieces of cream cheese along the way definitely made the experience worthwhile, so why not give this one a try?!\n\nSalted Caramel: \nRating: 3.5/5\nOne thing that I NEED, and I mean, absolutely NEED in my salted caramel ice cream, is the flavor and color! The salted caramel at the Creole Creamery was whitish, not the usual lightish brown I'm used to in terms of most ice cream shops. The caramel taste was light, but I didn't receive any of the \"salted\" flavor in the ice cream which I've previously received at other ice cream locations on the West coast. Overall, it could use more color, texture, and flavor.\n\nBanana's Foster:\nRating: 4.75/5\nWhat I loved about this particular flavor is the bits and pieces of small caramel and banana present in each bite I took. A hearty banana's foster on a hot day like this one is all I'd ever need to cheer me up! Not much to say about this flavor besides the fact that it tasted EXACTLY like the actual dessert, which made me smile a bit on the inside. \n\nCafe Au Lait:\nRating: 4.5/5\nI'm a HUGE coffee enthusiast, so trying this flavor was mandatory! The ice cream was pretty amazing, it tasted just like a freshly brewed cup of Cafe Au Lait which actually made my tastebuds fall in love with this particular scoop of ice cream. The sweetness of the ice cream wasn't overpowering, but just right! \n\nPistachio: \nRating: 3.5/5\nPistachio? Sort of difficult to pull off, but they got it sort of right. The ice cream's sort of light green, but the taste is smooth and creamy, more light then anything. \n\nIn conclusion, my only regret is that I was on a timed schedule and didn't have enough time to sit outside the entire time to enjoy the ice cream to the full extent! If you ever have extra time, this is the perfect place to take your close friends, family, girlfriend, etc. The customer service is extremely nice, and the employees are always attentive to your needs!

I got blueberry pie, red velvet cake, cookie monster and jalapeno strawberry cheesecake.  All 4 were awesome.  My favorite by far was the jalapeno strawberry cheesecake.  This, along with Melted Chocolate from Molly Moons in Seattle, are my 2 favorite flavors I have encountered at a local ice cream place.  The flavors just worked.  You get the rich strawberry cheesecake and then all of a sudden you get a hint of jalapeno.  They take the seeds out so you don't get the heat, just the taste.  Damn it was good!\n\n2nd day here I got 2 scoops in a waffle cone.  One scoop of the jalapeno strawberry cheesecake and then a scoop of the \"Mango Unchained\"  It was mango ice cream with cayenne pepper and Southern Comfort mixed in.  You could get a tiny bit of spice from the cayenne and then a smooth light mango taste as well as a hint of the SC.  These 2 flavors combined equaled a hell of an ice cream cone.  Another great thing they do here is they bend the bottom of their waffle cones.  Most places roll their cones and leave the sharp pointy tip.  That's cool and all,  but when its hot like it is in NO, your ice cream melts and then drips out the bottom.  These guys kind of rounded and tucked under the tip so its almost like a flat bottom.

I want what I want when I want it and nothing can hold me back when I've made my mind up on something. \n\nI seriously had no intention of any vacations for the remainder of the year. I made an announcement to our family early in the year that family time will be limited to nearby weekend getaways. Tampa was not in the cards until one day I was watching a Hallmark movie with my wife and got the notion stuck in my head that I would like a family photo with my mother and sisters. After all, we hadn't had a professional picture done since we were kids. \n\nSo I called them, and suddenly the entire family was excited with the prospect of a beach photo shoot, including my grumpy but lovable brother-in-law who only likes to visit two places: His sofa and the golf range. I decided a family vacation was in order sooner than later since mom is getting up in age and Thanksgiving week gave us the best opportunity. Enter Ashley Izquierdo Photography. \n\n\n[ THE EXPERIENCE ]\n\nAfter trying to schedule a session with another photographer, but never receiving a call back, I discovered your page on yelp and liked what I saw. I was surprised that you didn't realize you had any reviews on yelp, but at the time all three reviews were 5 stars. \n\nNever having worked with a professional before, I was surprised by a few requirements, such as paying in full for my session up front and the minimum guarantee of 45 good photos, but you worked with me to ease my mind and I appreciated you efforts. So many bad stories of prepaying a business for services that are never rendered was a stressful thought for me. I also REALLY, REALLY appreciated how you were lightening fast in responding to my texts as we kept in touch for nearly a month prior to our session. Many times I could see you were typing just seconds after I sent a message. That comforted my anxiety about paying upfront without knowing you (more than you can imagine). \n\nAlso I appreciate your being on time for our session and the extra effort you made in taking specific photos I requested. While you said our session would be available in your gallery in about 2 to 3 weeks, I was delighted they were ready in just a matter of days. I know I called worried because I had trouble opening the files on my moms archaic computer... but once I was back home in Atlanta, viewing them was a snap. \n\n\n[ FINAL THOUGHTS ] \n\nMy entire family (including those whom saw the pictures but were not there for the session) LOVED your work! At first I thought $350 was pricey since I am good with a camera and could have done the session myself with a tripod, but it was money well spent and I'm so happy to have made your acquaintance. \n\nMy only suggestion is don't take things to heart so easily. Some people (such as myself) calling to hire you don't know protocol or procedure when it comes to professional photography. Therefore, sometimes a question is just a question... not an attack that you must defend. I truly wish you much success in your future! You are very good at what you do and deserve all the business Yelp can send your way. While we were just a simple 1 hour photo session, your wedding & engagement pics in your online gallery are STUNNING, and your reviews on sites like The Knot & Wedding Wire speak volumes about your talent and professionalism. \n\nI hope you enjoyed working with us as much as we did with you! Happy to be your first Yelp sale! \n\n\nThanks again,\nRichard & Family\n\n\n2019/8", "date": "2019-01-25 16:34:22"}, {"_key": "4773089", "_id": "reviews/4773089", "_rev": "_fNzFbDm--N", "review_id": "xOLJ5yFTRQfuVyzbqDJ7NA", "user_id": "RCZ5M9o2-fxgFuurpmEs3w", "business_id": "_TGpTfvY0sA5dUH_3byRSg", "stars": 4, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Lauren does a very good job handling the inevitable \"hiccups\", and you can even make appointments online:)  We've been using Love 4 Paws for the past (3) years and plan to continue to use them for any future Pet Sitting needs:)  Thanks Lauren!", "date": "2016-07-26 03:28:41"}, {"_key": "4773776", "_id": "reviews/4773776", "_rev": "_fNzFbFK--C", "review_id": "WJOJTCYunFMNnnTrkwcZ7w", "user_id": "t3yOpTibhuvd-Lt7FMvqKg", "business_id": "tXfeVYKJq-bGPx1sjHOMHA", "stars": 4, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I'm not sure why this place has bad reviews.

We literally drive past here several times a day since we live up by the Ritz and we didn't feel like driving very far, we just wanted to get out of the house for a bit but this is the LAST TIME we will ever step foot in this \"restaurant\". The owner should call Robert Irvine with Restaurant Impossible to learn how to run a restaurant and serve good food. Seriously.  \n\nFirst of all, the set up is the most ridiculous I have ever experienced. You order up front when you walk in or you can take a menu and sit at a table of your choice but you still have to go up and order. They keep your credit card or driver's license up at the front until you pay. So you are giving up control of the safety of your card information or you are informing someone where you live and you are not at home - not a good system. Not sure how they remain compliant with their credit card merchant services, probably because they omit this tidbit of information when answering the mandatory questions.\n\nNow once you place your order, you get a number and a server will bring you your drink and food. If you have servers running food and drinks, why not have them taking orders? None of this makes sense! I go out to eat and drink to be waited on. I don't want to go to the front and stand in line every single time I want another round. The owner clearly doesn't know what he/she is doing as more drinks would be sold for certain and more food as well if this was a typical restaurant with actual servers. I also think the employees would make more money receiving tips. \n\nThe food. Sigh. The people working in the kitchen are not chefs. They are not cooks. They simply are heating up Sysco frozen food. Perhaps they toss on some fresh herbs to make it seem as though they actually cooked the food?  We ordered a flat bread and garlic parmesan fries. Both dishes arrived cold but because they don't have servers, only food runners, nobody comes around to check on you and the food.   Even if the flat bread had been hot, it was so lame that nothing could help it - no flavor, not really cooked, glops of cheese on it made it look unappetizing but there was a sprinkling of fresh basil. \n\nThere are always people here but don't let that fool you -  that is only because there is such limited choices to eat in this area!

Not really.  I think \"lost in translation\" is the reason why a restaurant like Wok on the Wild Side has so many negative reviews and why many restaurant don't even bother with translation.   \n\nI have never seen a restaurant generated so many opposite opinions.

The owner was from Dong Bei (North East China) and a first time restauranteur.  It seems like the combos were not well priced compare to the entrees and personally I would not recommend stir fry dishes that had being sitting out for more than 15 minutes.  I got the entree size xiang la pai gu and it came with a bowl of steamed rice.  I counted 11 meaty ribs pieces  with jalapeno, onions, and dry red chilies.  The sauce was very spicy and flavorful, but I agree with others that it was salty even considering that Sichuan cuisine tends to be heavily seasoned.  Most restaurants use cheaper long grain rice, but here they used starchier short grain rice that Chinese, Korean, and Japanese prefer because sticky short grain rice pick up sauce better than hard fluffy long grain rice.   \n\nI spotted a pan of kou shui ji next to a line of ubiquitous looking stir fries.  I can't help it but get a small box to go.  Kou shui ji literally translates to salivating chicken, so good, you'll salivate thinking about it.  Its boiled whole chicken cut into more manageable chunks, with bones and skins, soaked in a sauce made of spices and red chili oil.  This was not on the menu and it was very good and authentic.

I send it back, and one minutes later she said I can't have a fresh order if what I order happened to coincide with an entree that was already on the steam table.  I was not told about this little footnote when I ordered.  I complained to the server and the owner, but nothing was done to remedy the situation.

They are making some good adjustments, however, I still can't give them a higher rating because this place doesn't run smoothly.  We are not talking about people waiting in a line here.  At around 70% capacity, the restaurant goes into panic mode and can't seem to keep up with the order.  The restaurant employs 3 people in the back and 2 people in the front, in addition, the owner serves as float, doing whatever that needs to be done.  As someone who have worked in the restaurants including the back of the kitchen, I can't say they are understaffed.  Six people serving an ordering at the counter type restaurant with 14 tables is very reasonable.  \n\nI have no way of knowing what's going on in the kitchen, but the front is frustrating to watch.  I constantly see people coming out of kitchen stocking a couple of bowls.  Why don't you put all the bowls in a big dish bin and stock them all at the same time instead of making multiple trips into the kitchen?  They are also in desperate need of a couple of restaurant ticket holders.  They are less than $15 each and will hold the tickets in place so you don't have to fidget the tickets when a new one shows up.  What I see happening here is that one of the girl walks out of the kitchen with one plate of food and walks a few steps and remembers that she forgot the rice.  She then either walks back to the rice cooker to get more rice or she delivers the food and then go back to get a bowl of rice.  The kitchen is probably plagued with similar inefficiency because the table next to me didn't get their second dish until they were done with their first dish.  The second dish was scrambled egg with tomato, why did it take so long for such a simple dish?  Was the line not properly stocked or organized?  Some of the dishes share the same base sauce, maybe they can be mixed in a large batch ahead of time?  Perhaps they can put out a dish cart by the door and people can drop off the dirty dish on their way out?  What if you set the drink machine in the dining room so people can refill their own drinks?  The slow service is definitely due to inexperience and lack of proper restaurant tools.

Decided the reviews are sincere and let them stand.   I didn't get it.  \n\nA few days ago Wok got their first Five star review, then another, and another, and another.   I think a total of 8 or 9 in two days!!!   Again newbies, again first reviews.   You don't have to be a brain surgeon to recognize that someone was doing damage control.   I flagged and flagged and flagged, again Yelp for the most part disagreed and has decided that the reviews are sincere.

I mean some people get hit by lightning time and time again.    \n\nSo my curiosity got the better of me.    I went there for lunch yesterday.   I was expecting to see a sign twelve feet across that said \"5 stars on Yelp gets you a free meal!!!!\"   But it wasn't there. \n\nThe place has no d\u00e9cor, no atmosphere, they have those super light aluminum chairs that cheap restaurants seem to love so much, my guess is that they are $12 apiece.

His answer was \"Get anything that you want.\"   Thanks dude, very helpful.\n\nI ordered the Mongolian Beef, always a favorite.  I ordered the entree since it already comes with rice.   It was $9.72 before tip.    I was disappointed when I got my plate, a ton of rice and a teenie little bit of meat.

That.  Day.) service.  \n\nLet's begin with the yum:  \n\nThe burgers are hand formed, never frozen ample patties of juicy deliciousness.  Their fries are made from local potatoes and are also never frozen, are hand cut, and are on the thicker side of things (yay!).  They have fry sauce (double yay!), which is great, given my affection for getting saucy with my fries.  So, from a strictly--get your burger/fry fix stand point--this place absolutely delivers.\n\nThe lackadaisical:\n\nFirst off, when I went to get my soda (self serve), as I had just begun filling my cup, the diet soda (can't remember if it was coke or pepsi) began to sputter.  Dang.  But, no worries, I thought, as they had another machine that also featured the same sort of diet soda so I hopped over to that machine and pressed the button and out came a stream of clear soda water.  Annoying.  Then, after only half filling my fry sauce container--the fry sauce ran out.  And, this was on a very slow Sunday night (we practically had the place to ourselves).  We let them know, they told us they would take care of it, came and retrieved the canister but never returned it.  In fact, we went to a nearby bar (Bonefish) for after dinner cocktails and when we walked by an hour and a half later--they still hadn't refilled the fry sauce.  And, yes, we could have complained for a second time--but we were a large group and were too busy socializing to track down the sauce.  But, seriously folks...you load people up with fries like you do (they are VERY generous in their servings of fries), you need to deliver the sauce.  Period. \n\nOther notes:\n\nIf you don't ask for your cheeseburger to be a \"little\" one, you'll get two patties.  I get their \"little\" cheeseburger and it is absolutely ample.  \n\nSo...for the purpose of Burgerpalooza...where does this place rank as far as burger freshness, quality, and taste:  easily the second best burger in Boise (from the places we've hit thus far).  4+ stars.  \n\nFrom a service stand point?

It was the night of the Super Bowl so we found a restaurant with only two other guests in the dining area and just a handful at the bar. In other words, we had a restaurant to ourselves. Having a restaurant to yourself doesn't guarantee great service, but we got it anyway. Good start so far. Zea Rotisserie and Grill is great option for those looking to take a break from Po' Boys, Jambalaya's, and fried food.  What you'll find is a restaurant chain that serves seafood, sandwiches, Asian based BBQ, grilled food, and of course, rotisserie.  I can almost compare Zea to a Cheesecake Factory, but with a better food presentation and a dining experience that mimics fine dining.   \n\n-Garlic Hummus pita: This was our appetizer for the evening. I haven't had garlic based hummus before and pleased that I did. You still get the texture and taste of what you expect with hummus, but with an added buttery garlic taste to it. There's more hummus than there is pita and they are willing to hook up extra pita if needed.

The ribs are glazed with BBQ sauce and the meat is \"fall off the bone\" and \"melt in your mouth\".  As for their chicken, you get a seasoned and prepared rotisserie chicken.  Taste of their chicken rivals some of the top notch fine dining restaurants out there. Trust me.  (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=QN7x6WC505-ZoDT4ptVHig&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ)\n\nOverall, I have to say that I'm a fan. If I'm ever back out here, I'm sure that my meals will be centered around the foods that I can't get in California or Las Vegas. But if I'm looking for something good, more traditional, and just want a change of pace from NOLA's Southern type dishes, Zea Rotisserie is on my list.\n\n\n\nYELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (034/366)", "date": "2014-02-09 05:40:19"}, {"_key": "4900527", "_id": "reviews/4900527", "_rev": "_fNzFfou--C", "review_id": "rg5pEtrneZdD5BNB4GljDA", "user_id": "UEIOT1JdvCDIXLN8dQIiGg", "business_id": "IZmCSGeXLCB-Y2UvJrvr-A", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I love Zea's.

Right when walking in, you will find yourself transported back to the 70's. Not in a flower power peace sign kind of way but much more of a Mad Men swanky lounge kind of way. \n\nEllington's is located in the Fairlane Hotel in dowtown Nashville. The restaurant starts off right by offering free valet parking for restaurant patrons. The valet worker was very nice and excited to talk about the hotel and the restaurant. You know it's a good place when you see the worker's eyes light up when talking about it. I went here on a Friday night for dinner and it wasn't too busy seeing that they just opened. We were seated right away next to a window because I wanted to take in the ambiance of the interior. It was perfection. Clean lines, dark tones of green and blue, gold and wood, and fitting music to top it all off. Whoever thought of this concept had every detailed planned perfectly. I think it would be really fun to come back dressed in some of my 70's vintage best. Our server was really nice and helpful. She had great descriptions and opinions for the menu items. I started off the night with an Aviation. It was a beautiful gradient of white into blue and was equally delicious. I later ordered a New Heights IPA so they also have a nice beer selection. For an appetizer, we decided to try the Fetta. It was fetta, olive oil, thyme, and watermelon. At first I thought this sounded like a weird combo but man oh man was it surprisingly delicious. The salty and sweet really complimented each other well. Dinner also came with complimentary bread with jam and butter. I try not to fill up on bread but always fail to control myself. I ate most of the bread because it was so good. However, I still had room for my main course, the Roast Chicken. It was served with truffle jus, field peas, and potatoes. I always say that you if you can get me to eat my greens, you win. I ate it all. The flavor of the jus with the chicken and veggies was incredible. It was a big piece of chicken and plenty of veggies so I don't think you need a side dish with this meal. But maybe that's because I wanted to leave room for dessert. I had the Banana Pudding for dessert and it was the perfect way to end a perfect meal. After polishing off our meal, we took a little tour of the restaurant. Their is a full bar that is beautifully done and a balcony that wraps around about half of the building. The bathrooms are pretty cool so don't miss those! \n\nEllington's is really an experience. They dared to do something a little different with the theme and really pulled it off. If you want to impress someone with a nice dinner, take them here. They also do brunch and lunch!", "date": "2018-08-07 21:39:19"}, {"_key": "5317401", "_id": "reviews/5317401", "_rev": "_fNzF7eO--J", "review_id": "pqvVG3GDZ0XHk7Uqf_qmqw", "user_id": "cufhYFdyrUAt4SWe-m0grQ", "business_id": "FYIL5duVgc9eLyYw6hobmw", "stars": 2, "useful": 18, "funny": 4, "cool": 5, "text": "Maddening. This should be a 4.5/5 star review. Nashville is at a tipping point when it comes to bars/restaurants. I have heard time and again how difficult it is to find/keep good FOH/kitchen talent but doing so is essential to the business plan. I don't want this city to fizzle out when there's so much potential yet to be tapped. The fact of the matter, though, is when you're asking the buying public to dole out significant dollars, you have to be on top of your craft every time. You do.\n\nMy first experience at Ellington's came during their first week. I was (pleasantly) stunned by how well they tapped into the '70s cool of that era's James Bond, Hart to Hart, The Rockford Files, etc. Rather than depressing, the brass, browns, wood paneling, and large plants set a mood. This was punctuated by the music/muzak. My mood was further elevated by the menu. The choices of classic and signature drinks were well-curated (here, it makes sense to go with the classics). I was happy with my feta/watermelon appetizer and the shrimp & grits were delicious. Despite not having gluten-free desserts, I enjoyed the 1970s-era cups my post-meal coffee came in. I left happy. Very happy.\n\nThen, I came back the following week and the wheels fell off. This time around, the place was busier but not so busy that you couldn't sit. We were warmly greeted by the hostess from the previous week. Rather than being seated by the window (by the patio), we were seated by the wood paneling/mirror banquette. Fine so far. I liked having the new perspective of the dining room. I spied my waitress from the previous week and it looked like we were in her section. Nice! Hopefully she remembered my generous tip. And then we sat. And sat. And sat. We stared awkwardly at each other. My guest started to get annoyed and I got embarrassed. No one interacted with us. We weren't given so much as a glass of water. We felt extremely unwelcome. Finally, our hostess came by with water and a smile... but that was it. The waitress from the previous week who was being so gracious and charming with other tables twisted her body so as not to have to acknowledge us. Again. We sat. And sat. And sat. By this time, I am past being embarrassed. I am angry. A floor manager finally comes by to take our drink order. She says that she put too many covers in our server's section and that was the reason for the protracted delay. A few things about that: 1.) A lot of covers =/= being unable to stop by the table and say, 'Hi, folks. I'll be right with you and I'll have a runner drop some water off to you. Thanks!' 2.) There were other servers/runners in our section joking with and serving customers (who arrived before and after we did). 3.) No mention of 'Let me get you started with some drinks/apps on the house. So sorry for this mix up.' None of these things happened. Rather, after a tepid excuse for being treated like filth and watching our server - the same server I over-tipped the previous week - treat other guests with professionalism, I decided to leave. I went to the host stand, informed them that they could cancel my order and that we were leaving. In the midst of this, who should arrive? Our server. For the first time. Nope. Please continue to ignore us. You were doing that so well. The floor manager took my name and number and offered to have a manager call me. I left Ellington's and retired to the Fairlane lobby. I noticed two people from the restaurant had followed me down there but neither engaged. I used my Yelp app to find another eatery, left and have no plans on returning.\n\nIt's a shame.", "date": "2018-08-13 15:48:56"}, {"_key": "5325034", "_id": "reviews/5325034", "_rev": "_fNzF7vW--_", "review_id": "BEzeUqM-uM2Jdn0u_nUYhA", "user_id": "LS0Cj5IiH28NnSChCLPSQw", "business_id": "FYIL5duVgc9eLyYw6hobmw", "stars": 1, "useful": 6, "funny": 4, "cool": 5, "text": "No. No. No. \n\nI'm pretty sad to leave this review but it should be known. \n\nFirst, we walk in the place is basically empty.

He repeated and said you know what hey when we get the chicken we get the Brussels sprouts I'm literally said that is exactly what I want with no mashed potatoes. My chicken was fine nothing go home about and I didn't get sick which was a plus. \n\nThe shrimp and grits were also ordered thinking how can you screw up shrimp and grits. Well apparently you can. These grits were terrible and tasted like spiced dirt water. The shrimp was rubbery and tasteless. Whatever seasoning used was awful. They did take it off the bill and said they would also get dessert on them. \n\nOrdered the key lime pie because they were out of cheesecake. It was fine, but then I get the bill they freaking charged me for the dessert they said they were going to comp.

But there also things I didn't.\n\nThe good? Their happy hour has GREAT prices. A lot of happy hours in Nashville kind of suck? This one doesn't. Seriously discounted prices. All cocktails on their menu were half off. One house red (a red blend) and one house white (a pinot grigio) were half off. And all their beers were half off. HALF OFF. They had $2 oysters, and ALL THEIR STARTERS WERE $5. These are some real discounts. \n\nMore good? The service was good. The wine and the cocktail I had were good. The restaurant is beautiful. Very Donald Draper walking in for a few martinis over his lunch hour. And it's really close to TPAC. There aren't that many dinner options walking distance to TPAC, so another option is good. I'm not huge at sweating through a nice meal, so you won't catch me on a patio until late September but for those of you who like to sweat and or don't sweat - they have a beautiful patio as well. \n\nThe not so good? We decided to try ALL the starters (there are 7 of them) since they were all $5 (there were four of us). While some were better than others, only one really knocked my socks off. Here's what we had: warm olives with orange zest, roasted garlic and brioche (good, but it turned out that two of our party don't eat olives, and the other two of us coudln't eat the 100 olives that were in that bowl! way too many); piquillo peppers with queso fresco and chimichurri (okay); roasted cauliflower with togarashi spice, split pea puree, and ponzu (this wasn't a hit at our table); picked deviled eggs (this was the one - the one that impressed a lot - despite the fact that I'm not a deviled egg eater generally!); cheese curds with green goddess (okay - sort of bland cheese that could have been string cheese rather than a real cheese curd and I wouldn't be surprised); pork loin with white bbq sauce (I think that was the least favorite at our table - the pork seemed really dry and tough and bland); and a cold shrimp dish (I can't describe this one, because it wasn't on the menu, but it was one of the better starters in my opinion; the 7th starter on the menu was a feta with olive oil, thyme, and watermelon, but that's not what we got; all of our group ate shrimp, but I think they probably should have let us know that one of the dishes was different than on the menu). Overall, the food was okay at best. I was certainly happy with the cost ($35 for all 7), but the food definitely wasn't good enough that I'd be excited to eat there for dinner (when entrees range from $20-42). Some of the dishes we had seemed a little too much like bar food for the location and the prices (if weren't happy hour) - cheese curds? In a place as decked out as this? \n\nThe Fairlane Hotel is beautiful (this restaurant is on the 4th floor), but parking in this part of town is practically nonexistent, so you're going to have to valet out front or park in a nearby garage (I was parking for a show at TPAC anyway, so this wasn't such a big deal for me). \n\n(Note: we had a reservation for 4 at 5:30 on a Tuesday evening before Ilana Glazer's double header show at TPAC. We didn't need a reservation. The restaurant was still pretty empty when we left at 6:40.)\n\nThe restaurant is beautiful. And the happy hour is great.

Behind the counter there are usually two server working furiously to keep up with the demand and lineups.\n\nBut what exactly is \"bubble tea\" you ask?  Don't let the name fool you.  Many of the drinks don't even have tea in them.  The \"bubble\" part refers to the spaces in the wide straw between the soft balls of tapioca that one slurps up in the process of drinking.  The tapioca is referred to by the Asian name \"Sago\" and are chewy, golden-brown balls made from the starch of sweet potatoes.  They also look like bubbles, which is an alternate explanation for the drink's name. For people who dislike the texture, the drinks can be made without sago but it's worth trying - the sago is essentially flavourless and a lot of fun to chew!\n\nThe drinks themselves have a syrup or fresh fruit base, mixed with milk, juice, or tea.  They are 32 ounces and shaken in a plastic cup, over which a colourful thin plastic cover is attached.  When the drink is ready, the customer stabs the very wide straw through the cover, and enjoys pure taste pleasure.\n\nSyrup-based drinks are very sweet and available in a variety of fruit flavours.  There are also coffee varieties, from plain coffee to mocha, to coffee with almond.  By far the most popular drinks are the ones with fresh fruit.  Mixed with ice, fruit, syrup, and the milk, juice, or tea base, the creation is essentially a smoothie with a sweet kick.   Some of the varieties include strawberry, cantaloupe, and avocado.  Yes, avocado is a fruit, and it makes a very tasty smoothie - a nutty flavour with just a hint of sweetness.\n\nSince bubble tea originated in Taiwan, there are also a lot of uniquely Asian flavours to try, such as the gritty and vanilla-like taro root and lychee.  You can find all of this and more at the Tea Cottage, as well as a variety of hot coffee and tea drinks.
