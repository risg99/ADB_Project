Why is this place empty? I was disheartened to have been here during an empty lunch rush and to pass by at dinner time to see an empty dining room. Given the finesse of the menu, complexity of the cocktail program, beauty of the venue, and graciousness of the staff, it confounds me that Maypop would be anything but packed with people at all times. Anything otherwise just doesn't make sense.\n\nMy lunch crew came here on a rainy Thursday, eager for something distinct. When we walked in to find an empty room, my warning bell tinged a little. Why were we the only people in the room? It turns out we were because everyone else in the 504 had lost their minds. We were immediately greeted and seated and then our server, Mena, approached. Despite having all sorts of dietary issues to handle, she kept a smile, kept us fed and led us to some phenomenal food choices. I began my meal with a bourbon-based apples & spice cocktail. This Kentuckian is a fan of bourbon and when paired with apple and spice on a cold, rainy day... you can't beat it. The kitchen, then, sent out a gluten-free amuse bouche fish cake which perked me right up. The texture and flavor of the cake had me sorry that I couldn't have chosen it as an entree. That 'sorrow' continued with our appetizers  -- I was sorry I wasn't eating them all by myself. To start, we had fried oysters. Do you know how long it's been since I've had fried oysters since going down this gluten-free path? These were phenomenal. Served with watermelon radish, manchego cheese and pickled cucumber (swirled atop a bed of remoulade), every bite was a joy and my table polite argued about who was getting a second oyster (four of us, six oysters; order two). Our second appetizer was every bit as visually and mouthwateringly set as the previous one. The charred acorn squash came spiced and served with roti for the gluten folks and lettuce wraps for the gluten-free. Again, I wanted to have this all for myself. Hearty, comforting and deeper (flavor-wise) than one might think, this, too, is an exceptional cold weather dish.\n\nWondering if I might have used my stomach real estate before the main event, I had the bright idea to order another cocktail to add with digestion.* The playfully-named Pom Dot Com was a flute glass of gin, aperol, green chartreuse, and cava. Yes, please. Feeling fancy, my eyes widened to look at my swordfish entree. A generous portion of fish came with crusted spices, greens, and a sweet, spicy sauce. Any doubts about my stomach real estate were dashed when the meal was gone before I knew it. I believe the dish was a special of the day so, unfortunately, if you come to Maypop seeking it you might not find it. The good news is, everything is wonderful so you're guaranteed to have an exquisite meal.\n\nEven in a city as on top of its culinary game as New Orleans is, I would eat here again and again. I'm hoping that the freak weather was the reason that people weren't lined around the corner waiting to get in. Maypop deserves that. Actually, I'm glad I was able to get in easily so as to have a meal I am going to remember for quite a while but when you have a restaurant like Maypop in your backyard, you support it. Maypop, if New Orleans isn't treating you right, come to Nashville. We'll take care of you.\n\n*I'm sticking to that narrative.", "date": "2017-12-13 18:46:37"}, {"_key": "10004496", "_id": "reviews/10004496", "_rev": "_fNzDxSi--B", "review_id": "ce7bUcUHb01WzrqbfR967g", "user_id": "TwnjeqMA2GemAYicDfghAQ", "business_id": "-s21e7WmGqex0Et2-bj7QA", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I have been here twice and they have been amazing.

It was Asian tapas portions with the last course being an entree portion. We let the chefs do their thing, instead of us choosing, and were very impressed with each course. I loved the edamame dumplings that had truffle in them, and the roasted seabass that melted in your mouth. I'm salivating just thinking of each item we had. The cocktails were phenomenal too.

I took my car in for service after noticing some paint coming off inside my driver side car door last week that I can't seem to determine where or what it came from. \n\nSo I immediately bring it up as I check in for my oil change to the first person. I'm told how much the spot \"resembles\" and how it \"looks\" as if it could be paint thinner. And also that \"it was probably from my shoes\" along with how it won't be covered under warranty. Which is apparently everyone's response when they don't know what else to say at Nissan. \nSo afterwards I drive over to the body shop at Nissan. The employee steps outside and takes a look seems confused and eventually gets the assistant manager.\nI'm immediately told by the manager \"well I'm just being honest but this won't be covered\". Later he tells me that the body shop doesn't even deal with paint/warranty issues but that he would fix it for $150. And that he doesn't even know why I went to the body shop? \nThen I'm told to go back to services where I started. \n\nSo back to square one where I meet, but not really, the fourth person of the day.\nI pull back up to the service center where I watch as this strange man, not even introduced to me, walks around my car, takes a few looks, while the guy from the body shop is saying god knows what to him. I just stand there, so annoyed, so embarrassed at this point wishing I could jump in my car and drive away, never returning to this place ever again. This man looks down at my door frame, grabs a flashlight, stops, looks up at me and says \"So what'd ya spill, haha\". Yes laughter. \n\nNot ONCE did I ever hear any statement such as \"we will do our best\" \"let me see what I can do\" \"we can try to fix it\" hell I didn't even get a \"we will\" anything. \nI continued to get \"We can't guarantee\" \"this won't be that\" \"this isn't under warranty\" and was never even offered to file a claim, only told how pointless it was.\n\nFinally, finally this guy decides to take some pictures and maybe do something. As I'm finally leaving I'm told by this man, \"the last claim I did took over three weeks just so you know\". It was definitely very settling to hear, made me feel really good about this. \n\nThis results in a not so nice review for Nissan on yelp.\n\nThe next day I receive a phone call from the last person I saw at Nissan, Mark. The only reason I eventually found out his name was because I had to call him back. I return the call to hear \"hey we submitted your claim today\". I'm thinking wow awesome but I should probably get that information from him just to make sure. But before I could even say anything else I hear \"hey is your husband home\". Weird right? I never mentioned my husband nor was he with me yesterday...\nAs I told him how he was at work I was cut off several times by Mark who INSISTED that my husband gave him a call immediately due to not liking his review on yelp. The professionalism completely went out the window with this call, as well as any respect, not that I had very much to begin with. \nI then decided to tell Mark how I had spoken to another dealership and was told that my issue could more than likely be resolved over warranty with no cost to me. \nHis first words \"well then I can't submitted this claim any longer you are now taking your services elsewhere\". I went on to explain to Mark that I hadn't received any services elsewhere just only made some calls. And that I still wanted the claim submitted, at this point just to see if he ever went through with it--which I don't believe he did. \nSo after several minutes of arguing, yes arguing. I had my husband call him. Like he insisted. \nThe conversation between the two mainly consisted of how everything I said was a lie and that none of the above was true and I made it ALL up. And so on... Mark also told my husband that he submitted the claim for me the second I drove off from Nissan. Which I find funny, given that he called me the next day just to tell me how he had submitted my claim--the next day! \nOr did he really only call me just to speak to my husband after he saw the review? \n\nNO I will never go back to Nissan of Rivergate. \nNO, a claim was never filed, especially after my husband had to call this guy over a review. \nNO, I don't want anything out of this either. \nYes another dealership will be helping me, not only to file a claim, but also get it under warranty--and this was all done over the phone. I haven't even stepped foot into this other dealership yet and already I've received all I've ever asked for, loyal customer service.\n\nSo, if you want customer service of ANY type, DO NOT go to Nissan of Rivergate.", "date": "2017-12-21 13:46:32"}, {"_key": "10009928", "_id": "reviews/10009928", "_rev": "_fNzDzdO--F", "review_id": "lEknSAqxqIZt-HoiWOCocQ", "user_id": "9y-c-H3QKZbwNVQEdKy_7g", "business_id": "8t33UzQWLhDdOKQG9MBt9Q", "stars": 3, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I really only go to Ross for dresses and for homegoods.

We ended up finishing our tasks early and got to the restaurant at 7:45 pm. We were chastised - not joking - by the guy at the front, who told us we had arrived too early. We told him we understood and after calming down, the employee told us we could sit at the bar and sit get served food.\n\nAfter a rude introduction, I enjoyed sitting at the bar. Our bartender/server, unlike the man at the front, was very sweet and extremely attentive - my water glass was never empty the entire meal. Though I didn't drink last night, I also enjoyed the look and energy of the bar, including the unique cocktails the bartenders concocted.\n\nI ordered the Florida Pompano, complete with a creamy tomato sauce, fried carrot ribbons, mashed potatoes, and green beans. As an occasional pescatarian, eating meat is quite heavy on my stomach. That didn't stop me from scarfing down half of the pompano filet last night - the sauce was INCREDIBLE and everything, even the carrot ribbons, worked well together. Though I'd prefer a better presentation - having the carrots piled on one side of the plate wasn't particularly appealing visually - I didn't have any complaints about the taste and creativity of the entree.\n\nI ended the meal with a slice of guava pie. The presentation was lovely, and the taste decent. I didn't mind the dessert ultimately, but I'm not going to be clambering to find another slice.\n\nUltimately, I liked this place.

I decline politely but decide to go in because my mom loves peppermint bark, it'll make a nice gift. We go inside and wow - talk about the \"kid in a candy store\" effect. This place is so cool and so ... pretty and fun! There are towering displays of candy and other sweet treats all around. The people who work here are in the cutest outfits and they're all so nice. As you walk around there's people handing out more samples. I'm offered matchsticks and I ask what's in them. The girl tells me it's white chocolate with popping candy in the end. I eat it and omg it's so amazing ! Who would have thought to combine the two. It's honestly so fun to just look around this store but I of course end up putting many things in my basket the manager asked if I needed a basket and I declined only to pick one up moments later because I just kept picking up stuff. I didn't even look at everything I just tried to focus on what I was buying for gifts. I picked up the peppermint bark - $24 for a fun, some of their popcorn, they have so many flavors - $12 for a container. I picked up a Rice Krispie which they had in a tower of assorted flavors. Those were 5.50 I believe , but buy 3 get 1 Free. The manager also informed me of this sale and I told her I didn't need to buy that many she suggested gifts which I probably could have bought them and used as gifts so the idea (and push of sale ) was thoughtful and informative but not something I needed. I then got to the counter and was helped by another cheerful associate when I got macarons. A box of 6 for $16. I believe they were $2.95 each. They had a lot of flavors as well as truffles in the case. It all looked good. When checking out I signed up for their rewards - it's free - and you get free things! I also got a free bear, I'm not sure why- but I like free things.  All in all, this place was awesome.

I've eaten multiple entrees, from sandwiches to pizza as well as their appetizers.  I say when properly made because in the majority of dining experiences, either my wife, myself, or both of us have ended up being glutened.  \n\nI've had to return multiple sandwiches because they were cut with the same knife as the non gluten-free sandwiches or appetizers that had been cooked directly touching the standard non gluten-free pizzas.  In general, if the managerial staff was there, it was all friendly and there were no issues.  Unfortunately, the majority of the time, the managerial staff is nowhere to be seen and any issues about cross-contamination or direct contamination are met with idle stares, rolled eyes and suggestions that the food was, \"probably fine\" despite having sauces or dressing from other non-gluten free items being spread across the center where the sandwich was cut with an unclean knife.\n\nI really wish the managerial staff and owners did a better job of explaining allergies and communicating with their employees the issues concerning cross-contamination and the need for clean utensils and work-spaces.  \n\nWith roughly twenty visits, we've had issues with being glutened most of the time.  As I've said before, the food, when properly made, is great and I have no complaints with any of the managers and or owners.

Because it was a Saturday during a busy New Years' Eve weekend, we decided to make reservations for 7:00. Upon arriving, I was a little shocked to see that place only had 1 other table seated. However, by the time we left, the place was packed, including a full bar. It seems that 8:00 is their busiest time. The restaurant is connected to the Southern Food and Beverage Museum, and it looks like it can even open up to serve drinks to private parties there. The dining room faces an open kitchen, which happened to showcase Chef Isaac Toups himself tonight. We watched him as he expertly whisked away at the custard for a tarte a la bouillie, a traditional cajun dessert, for his New Year's Eve dinner tomorrow night. The decor featured art of the places where the resturant sources its meat and vegetables, antique cajun kitchrn and farm equipment, and signs from local southern groceries and businesses. the tables and lightening though had a modern feel to them. All in all, a great atmosphere. We began with cocktails. I'm an Old Fashioned snob, so I ordered one with Bulleit. I rarely enjoy them in restaurants, but this one was exceptional. My girlfriend order the Toups Julep. I came with shaved ice like a snowball on top. It was very whiskey forward. She also later ordered a cranberry cocktail with gin that was recommended by the waitress. It was a tiki drink, served in a ceramic fish, and had a refreshing taste, including a nice touch of rosemary. She much preferred this drink. For apps, we ordered the biscuits with crab fat butter, spicy pork belly crostini, and the special, which was a pork chorizo with sweet peppers, cilantro, and lime crema. The special was not quite what I expected, as it wasn't as spicy as a chorizo, but it was absolutely delicious and well balanced. The spicy pork belly was indeed spicy, a little too spicy even for my cajun taste buds. The olives added some acid that the plate needed, and the ricotta tamed the spice and acid. It was also ground up pork belly and not a thick slab as I was expecting. The biscuits were great, very large and buttery. The crab fat butter had a little too much of the crab fat in my opinion. Because we order so many small plates, we decided to split the fried pork chop stack. We were told by the waitress that many people don't realize, but it as actually meant to be eaten as self-made sandwiches. As it was being completed, we actually watched Chef Toups spin a knife in the air and stab it through the chops. The pork chops were massive, the biggest I've ever seen in my life. They were fried to a golden crisp, but they were very rich and greasy. Nothing light bout these pork chops. They were served with pickled squash, a tasty aioli, and 4 slices of Bunny white bread like you would buy from the grocery store. Definitely reminiscent of my childhood. I'm from south Louisiana, so my only complaint was that though they were excellently fried pork chops, they were just pork chops. I would recommend trying some of the other entrees, but the small plates were all great. I would give it a 3.5/5, but if I had to choose 3 or 4, I would give it a 4. We will definitely be back to try those entrees.\n\nLast bite: round end of the chorizo.", "date": "2017-12-31 03:19:13"}, {"_key": "10020587", "_id": "reviews/10020587", "_rev": "_fNzD0oi--A", "review_id": "qQO1BxVfraZSBgKuxofayw", "user_id": "PlWZzesLe_hjQuNO4P7rIw", "business_id": "6g-6r9o9FO727edn8uKnCg", "stars": 1, "useful": 2, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "text": "I had a really bad experience with this gym, the fitness director Kelly N., was very rude and very unprofessional to me so I express my feelings to her and she just did say anything. and than I went to the Joan the admin. and she said she would talk to her and still nothing happen.

Incredibly thorough he did a involved exam,  pictures,  measurements and really took his time to document everything about my teeth.   He handed me off to the hygienist,  Julie who was equally incredible. She was gentle, made sure I was comfortable and chatted with me like she knew me forever,  which is especially helpful when she's the one with the instruments working on my teeth :). \nI've had many very bad dentists and really bad experiences and this I can say was the best experience I've ever had.

She even asked our names to know us on a personal level!  She took us in with open arms with full of joy and spirit and talked to my girlfriend like as if they knew each other from somewhere else !  Pam is a very lovely person as it appears she can cheer your day up.  My girlfriend ordered shepherds pie and i ordered big breakfast (see pictures), with a side of sausages and pancakes (not shown).\n\nHomemade hash browns couldn't be any better,  bacon, eggs, toast, and ham were just right.  I like how the butter wasn't stone hard and easily spreadable.\n\nThe shepherds pie was so OH MY GOD !  Definitly a MUST when you come here ! Sausages are spot on, coffee was good.\n\nThe special hot sauce that they offered was alright but not enough for me for my tolerance.\n\nThe pancakes and garlic bread were perfect, the syrup isn't maple but it's alright, I'm sure it's store bought.\n\nThe decor is good 'ol country home decor, relaxing in my taste.  The crowd ranged from young non city-slicking professionals to construction-dads-going-work to old timers who reminisce over breakfast.\n\nMy girlfriend ordered coconut cream pie as suggested by Pam mentioning it was her favourite and I had lemon berry just because I saw it in the Yelp photos.  Coconut was also oh my god as it tasted like a fresh juicy coconut jumped into my mouth.  Lemon berry was flavourful and not too sweet.  The breaded crust was a tad short.\n\nDuring our stay, there was a lineup at the door which I guess this place is favoured a lot by the neighbouring locals.\n\nWill we come back again?  Definitly we will.  My only suggestion is to update the store front sign.

The crust was thin and crispy - the toppings were fresh and tasty. Cooking it only took a couple of minutes in the pizza oven. Wow! Now this is some tasty pizza!

I love when the outside is nice and thin and crispy and the inside is nice and tender. These were exactly what I was craving.\n\nAs far as pho goes- Le Delat has a massive selection of all types including beef, chicken and vegetarian. I got P25 which was the eye of round steak and fatty brisket. I got the \"large\" size and I am very happy to report that their large size is actually large! The broth was flavorful and it was packed with a generous amount of meat.

That's right, during my three night stay at this facility as part of a wedding party last weekend I witnessed all of these things, and several more as well.

The atmosphere is very dated and is essentially in a what appears to be an older home. We were seated quickly and provided a menu that offers many options. We ordered the Pho with rare steak and brisket w/o onions, Pho with only rare steak, a lychee drink and a bubble jack fruit smoothie. Within only a couple minutes out Pho was at the table piping hot just as ordered. The broth tasted very good, the rice noodles were the perfect texture but the meat was a little dry. The lychee drink came out next and was packed with lychee fruit in the bottom of the glass, it was so sweet and delicious. The bubble smoothie was soon to follow and it arrived at our table in what appeared to be a to-go cup. The pictures of the smoothie in the menu and on the tv monitors throughout the restaurant represented it served in a glass, just like the lychee drink. I asked our server for one in a glass and he assured me that it was just freshly made. We ended up enjoying the smoothie but would've probably wanted to just go to the bubble tea shop around the corner.

I said great let's go! I made a u-turn and we were off.\n\nWe were greeted with a smiling face and seated quickly. The restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating, all of which is very clean and cute.\n\nIt took a few minutes for the waiter to come by, but it was ok since we were chatting:\n\nHere's what we ordered\n(My order) 2 eggs over medium, hash browns with rye toast and a single pancake - water to drink\n\n(Nikki's order) 2 eggs over medium, home fries with wheat toast and a single pancake - froze to drink\n\n(Mom's order) French fries and a glass of cab\n\n\nHere's what we received (20+minutes later):\n(My order) 2 eggs over HARD, grits and wheat toast (as the waitress who brought our food could not differentiate the toast)\n\n(Nikki's order) 2 eggs over HARD, grits and rye toast\n\nThe separate pancakes we ordered came on the same plate so we asked the waitress to separate them for us, and she did.\n\nAt this time our waiter came over and I asked what the white stuff on my plate was and he informed me it was grits. I said bluntly I thought it came with home fries/hash browns. He said yes, but we are out of home fries so they said they would substitute with grits and I told them that wa ok! Politely we stated neither one of us like grits and we would like hashbrowns...\n\nNow everything on my plate has grits on it including my eggs (gross!)\n\nWe had been done eating for at least 20 minutes and still no waiter, so i politely asked a nearby waitress if she could help up get our check as our waiter never came back. She apologized and 6 more minutes passed and our waiter arrived with our check and said \"I was not hiding I was trying to get your hashbrowns\". Strange as it seems that it what he said.. now 45+ mins and still no hash browns.\n\nFrom this point on we never saw our sever again, and did not receive hash browns until we paid and were getting up to leave. We declined the hash browns and left disappointed.\n\nAll in all, very disappointing for a new restaurant in our hipster/foodie downtown. \n\nTips for the establishment:\n1. If you are out of something, ASK the customer what they would like to eat, after all they are the PAYING CUSTOMER.\n2. Check on the customers, my mom and Nikki were never offered a 2nd drink\n3. Diners are known to have fast service and turn around time, this is seriously lacking\n4. If you are going to serve mainly breakfast, ensure the cooks know how to properly prepare eggs\n5. Serving staff needs training on food items, not knowing what different breads are is unacceptable in a breakfast joint\n\nTips for my fellow foodies, do not go yet. They may need time to wire out some more kinks and training issues.

They were both apologetic at the time and Connor offered to refund the entire check and give us a $100 gift card for the inconvenience.

The locals raved out Neyow's but I wasn't that impressed. The food was just okay. \n\nWe visited on a Friday afternoon and the place was packed. We were squeezed into a corner not far from the door so it was freezing. I visited NOLA the one weekend it happened to snow for the first time since before Hurricane Katrina. It was freezing outside by New Orleans standards and there seemed to be no heat on in the restaurant. I know it rarely gets cold in certain part of the south but you can't tell me that Neyow's did have heat!! Eating with our coats on wasn't fun.\n\nAnyway, we were greeted by our server to who was kinda an odd duck. He was nice but a little weird. Socially awkward maybe.... just strange. My brother is a jokester and this guy didn't get the jokes at all nor could he just play along. He did his job though and was fairly attentive so no harm no foul. \n\nI ordered the catfish with mac and cheese. The catfish was just okay. It wasn't horrible but wasn't exactly something I'd order again. The mac and cheese was gross. It was unlike any mac and cheese I've never eaten. It was made with spaghetti or some other type of pasta topped with a mound of cheese that tasted like it came out of bottle or can. Everyone at the table tasted it and no one liked it. My sister had the chicken, mashed potatoes and green beans. She liked the mashed potatoes but said the chicken was just okay. The green beans had no flavor. My brother had some sort of pasta that he also said was okay. He liked the drinks he ordered more than the food. He did love the oysters though.

The server advised they could put both in without advising there would be an additional $6.00 charge to do this.  I ordered the crispy duck and asked for pork belly as well.  We also ordered some gyoza to share.  \nThe ramen arrived very soon afterward before the appetizer.  The server apologized and said it would be right out.  We asked that it be taken off our bill and forget the order.\nThe taste and flavor were simply incredible.  The rich broth was silky and full of delicious flavor.  The duck was tender and delicious with generous pieces.  The pork belly was a big disappointment.  Although pork belly is generally fatty, the pieces were almost entirely fat with little meat.  I'm sorry it was added (especially knowing it added $6 to the tab!)\nLastly, during the entire meal, the was a constant thud of a bass speaker that was really distracting and annoying.  upon leaving, I asked the hostess if the music was coming from an adjacent club and she advised it was in fact music in the restaurant.

I am not in a place to be buying a new/used car, and I certainly am not trying to have a new/car payment. I have enough bills already, thank you!\n\nIt was at this time that I decided to inquire with Bill Pearce Collision Center if they would be willing to put the car back together with those pieces of my car that were removed and replace those that couldn't be with OEM parts to make my vehicle road safe, so when the time came to re-register my car with a salvaged title it would be 1 less thing to worry about. Sharlene had confirmed that is was not a problem and for Jeff to give me a quote for that to be done. I received the quote while I was there (literally only had to wait 10 min. max), and Jeff was even kind enough to walk me out to the lot where my car was to show what exactly needed to be replaced in order for parts to be where they are supposed to be.  I was more than willing to have a less than perfect car returned to me, as long as it was deemed \"road safe\" (i.e. new headlight and front bumper).  Kim, the customer service poster child, and Sharlene even went ahead and inquired with Enterprise about a car rental for me and insisted Enterprise allow me to use their discount. \n\nUnfortunately, Sharlene's kindness and desire to be as helpful as possible was apparently DERAILED by Mike, the manager, who made it abundantly clear (2 days after I thought I had finally caught a break and already paid to rent a car), that Bill Pearce Collision Center would NOT be able to make the repairs that I was quoted due to their own liability purposes.  \n\nNeedless to say, I was more than disappointed by this information when I received it from Jeff; however, Jeff did his very best to be compassionate to my unfortunate circumstance(s) and informed me that this information was not given to him, by Mike, until today (2 days after the quote was given).\n\nThe somewhat good news Jeff had for me was that the parts to repair my car had already been ordered and delivered, so if I did want to repair the car myself then I could purchase those parts from them with no problem (if I choose to keep the vehicle and not give it to the money-hungry, blood-sucking, non-compassionate insurance monsters: Progressive). \n\nThank you for trying your best, Bill Pearce Collision Center.

Still, we were reluctant to have it removed because it would be such a drastic change to our view. And so, we dragged our feet ...until recently, when the problem became unavoidable.\n\nI nervously called several tree removal companies and ended up hiring Branching Out after meeting with Jim for an estimate. He is really knowledgeable and experienced with the desert ecology here in Tucson and shared his understanding about our problem tree with us. Their price was a little on the high side, but as you will see from my comments, it turned out to be well worth it.\n\nThey scheduled the removal almost immediately and when the day came, they showed up *on time* with a crew of several workers. These guys obviously knew what they were doing and from the very first moment we could tell we had made a good choice in hiring them. What a team!\n\nThe tree itself stood roughly 25-30 feet tall and right away, their designated-height-man suited up in climbing spurs and hiked up the tree to lop off branches. It was truly awe-inspiring to watch this guy operate a full-sized chainsaw with his arm fully outstretched! \n\nAs he carved away, the guys on the ground took care of dragging off all of the dropped limbs, which covered a very impressive amount of open ground alongside of their wood chipper. They ran all of the branches through the chipper, carried away the firewood sized trunk wood (which was clearly diseased, sealing our, admittedly-hindsighted, judgment that it really, *really* needed to be removed!), and cleaned up every last bit of sawdust and leaf matter from the area.\n\nEvery single interaction I had with this company was positive and gave me great confidence. I hope that I never have to have another tree removed, but trees grow and die...

My previous experiences were fine, so I honestly don't know if the new ownership is the problem, but my most recent experience - at least after actually driving away with the car - has been awful. \n\nI'll start with the good. My salesman worked with me primarily over email, which was a huge help to me since I didn't have a ton of time and the dealership is a little out of the way for me. I made an appointment to come in on a Saturday and was able to drive off in my new car in under 2 hours - which was pretty awesome. \n\nThat's where the good ends. First, they didn't explain the process of settling the balance on my old lease at all. I assumed since I was rolling the last few payments in to my new Kia that they would take care of paying the remaining payments. This was apparently not the case. It wasn't until I called Kia Motors Finance a week or 2 later about a separate issue that I found out my old lease hadn't been paid off and I didn't know why. A week or so later, I received a check that I had to deposit and then send a check off to KMF. Not a huge deal - but they didn't explain that I would need to do any of that. \n\nThe larger issue is the mess around receiving my paperwork for the BMV in a timely manner. I was originally told it would be emailed to me. Several weeks later, I emailed to let them know I hadn't yet received it. The manager said he would check on it and get back with me. I didn't hear back from him for a week. When I followed up, he said he would check on it and give me a call back. Then he had someone else call who said I would be receiving it in the mail. When I told him my plate expired in a matter of days and that wouldn't work, he would be emailing it to me. That person didn't email or call me back for 2 days. At that point, I was 2 days out from my temporary plate expiring. I call back and the person in the office says I have to come in (the dealership is 20 miles away from me) and get a different plate to buy them more time. I ask why this is going on and he says it's because they are short staffed. I ask when I will receive my paperwork - he says, \"probably in a few weeks\". \n\nShort staffed or not, I think every customer deserves follow-up on a outstanding issue within a reasonable amount of time. Especially considering this is the 3rd vehicle I have leased from them. At this point, no one is returning my calls (have outstanding messages with both the gentleman from the office and the manager who is currently avoiding me) and no idea what the status of my paperwork is. \n\nDon't buy a car here unless you enjoy the feeling of customer service going out the window the minute you drive away in your new car.", "date": "2017-12-18 21:11:35"}, {"_key": "10050219", "_id": "reviews/10050219", "_rev": "_fNzD19e--I", "review_id": "doI8lmr2UxkSjuD-ftTJFg", "user_id": "PYBCqUOjbhlx2cqwlKnVhg", "business_id": "IAOJuLejVtnZJpw15Txu9A", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Modern restaurant with great flavors.

This place will make you feel like the most important person on the planet. The staff is so attentive from the moment you arrive. The workers in valet are super nice and welcoming. Front desk staff was very nice and quickly checked me into my room. After they offered a glass of champagne or a mimosa! All of the other staff we encountered were also extremely happy, polite, and willing to go the extra mile to make our stay amazing.\n\nThe pool! This, I believe, is the main selling point of this resort. It's simply beautiful and well maintained. It's beachfront with everything you can imagine. A few steps from the pool is their fire pit, some hammocks, and their beach amenities such as lounge chairs, cabanas, ect. There really is no reason to leave this area as they have everything you can ever need for the beach!\n\nNow to the bad.. As I said before, not much has changed in 10 years, this includes the decor. These rooms need some serious updating all around. Our tub was chipping away at the bottom, the facet was pulled away from the wall, and the furniture was severely warn. For a luxurious resort, that is pricey, I would expect even these small things to be important.\n\nThe worst though was the mattress. It was the MOST uncomfortable mattress I have layed on. It was so firm and the tiny pillows didn't help. I'm not sure why they only have half size pillows, but that needs to change. I can pay 1/3 the cost to stay somewhere else that has a more luxurious and comfortable mattress and pillow.\n\nOverall The Sandpearl is a beautiful resort that needs to fine tune some things to become what it once was.", "date": "2017-12-10 01:53:10"}, {"_key": "10051433", "_id": "reviews/10051433", "_rev": "_fNzD2AK--D", "review_id": "x_Nq1BoCI4vlU2-PvzGC4w", "user_id": "VLoIWmnpal30HimeORqnhw", "business_id": "8UPv1p9GW-BiZtQqUt8nOA", "stars": 4, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "This spot always has the best soul fresh and hot!

I think \"Ok, yeah those people thought it was all that and a bag of rice cakes.\" but what is it REALLY like.\n\nBluefin Poke has met and exceeded my expectations.  The concept is not unique at all, but the execution is quick and painless.  The subway style build it yourself is ramping up to jump the shark, but for now I am all in!  It's so much more fun building it as I go.  \"Do I want this?  Does white onion compliment the fish in the dish?\"  The menu goes step by step as you would expect.  I think the offerings are just about right when it comes to sheer quantity of choice.  Not too many choices to bog you down, but not too few, which could leave you with the impression you didn't get a well balanced bowl.\n\nI only tried the spicy aioli and the ponzu mixed together.  Next time I think I will be just doing ponzu, it's normally my favorite.  I chose all of the protein offerings in a large bowl.  Those proteins would be spicy tuna, salmon, tuna, yellowtail, scallops and shrimp.  My favorite was probably the tuna or the shrimp.  All were fresh tasting and super satisfying on top of a mix and match bed of brown rice and greens.  The brown rice had the right consistency which was a pleasant surprise.\n\nThey don't have a ton of drink options but they are still getting everything up to speed.

MOST of the parking lot had cones blocking most parking spaces off for valet parking . This left a smaller area for self-parking.  I was not about to valet my brand new 2 day old car and had to drive around trying to find a parking spot.  This was a Monday night, our reservation was for 7:30.  The restaurant was pretty empty so I'm not sure why they felt the need to reserve so many valet spots.  See my photos and you can see one of the parking areas with all cones for valet with no cars in it.  If you see everyone is preferring to self-park, why not open up more parking spaces to self-park??!!\nI didn't deduct any stars for this inconvenience because the food was that good.", "date": "2017-12-14 01:03:06"}, {"_key": "10058208", "_id": "reviews/10058208", "_rev": "_fNzD2Q---I", "review_id": "6pLQqQS7LfjhBYX3lwnJog", "user_id": "fccMIyBd6ZhFUVAhvSqsrw", "business_id": "EJvsEmwbGRgPdiUX-YzNgw", "stars": 5, "useful": 2, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "text": "I stayed at le Meridien during a work trip and overall enjoyed my stay.

The diner was about half full, and there was plenty of staff.  We were seated promptly, and started looking at the menu.  Our server came over and asked what we would like to drink (coffee and water).\n\nThe drinks eventually came - coffee, but no milk/cream, no straws for the water.  We asked for milk, and he brought us some creamers and attitude.\n\nA few minutes later, he came over with more coffee, and promptly spilled mine all over the table.  He and a bus person quickly cleaned up, taking my spoon and the paper placemat, saying that he would bring a fresh set up.  He brought me another cup of coffee to keep my full cup company.  Never saw the placemat or the spoon again.  I hope they're ok.  My first coffee was happy to have companionship.\n\nThe server came back a few minutes later to refresh our coffees.  We refused.  He said he would give us a few minutes to look over the menu.  We were thankful for the extra time, because 15 minutes isn't long enough to look over the three page menu that contains fairly basic diner food.\n\nHe came back, and took our orders.  Some more people came in, were seated, ordered and received their food.  He came back and said our food would be ready shortly.  More people came in, sat, ordered and got their food.  We didn't.\n\nI can only assume that they were taking extra care with our food after the coffee incident, but never got another update on the status.  Our server was deep in conversation with 3 others, and I didn't want to interrupt.\n\nAfter being there for a half hour watching other people (who arrived and ordered after us) eat, I threw a couple of $$ on the table for the coffee, and we left.  \n\nWent across the street and got food in half the time.\n\nEvery diner I've been to has been well run, quick and tasty. 2nd and Second is not well run or quick.  As for tasty, I can't say.\n\nI can understand some issues when first opening, but two weeks should be plenty of time to iron most of them out.

Yes, Southern is that good.  When I moved to St. Louis two years ago, I came because my then-girlfriend and I wanted to try the famous ribs at Pappy's, but the line was too long. We instead went next door to Southern, where the reasonable wait belied the beatific smile with which we would depart their hot chicken experience. It isn't good--it's possibly the best Nashville hot chicken in the world. \n\nI know because my fianc\u00e9 is obsessed with fried chicken: traditional southern, country, Korean, Taiwanese, broasted, you name it.  Inspired by our first Revelation at Southern, we made a weekend pilgrimage to Nashville in search of the source, to pay our respects to the masters. We had fried chicken five-out-of-six meals, including Hattie B's and, of course, where Nashville hot chicken all started, the original Prince's. We were impressed, our taste buds were delighted, but what really amazed us was that the chicken at Southern was better.  Like Rick Lewis had dueled banjos with the devil and emerged with his soul and the best hot chicken recipe between heaven and hell. \n\nWe returned to St. Louis with an even greater appreciation for this gem glistening at our oily fingertips. Since then, every time my then-girlfriend-now-fianc\u00e9 comes to visit, we have to stop at Southern for four or five pieces of the dark meat (hers \"hot,\" mine \"medium\"), a couple sides and some Urban Chestnut or Four Hands brews.  When friends and relatives come through town, I take them here.  When colleagues come in on business, I send them here.  It has become our favorite restaurant.\n\nSo when it came time to ask this amazing woman if she would spend the rest of her life eating chicken with me, I knew we had to do it here. A few weeks before the date, I dropped a note on the restaurant website's contact form and Billy the manager got back to me the next day to set up a phone call, excited to be a part of this special day. Apparently, nobody had ever proposed at Southern before, but Billy was happy to help me realize my modest vision and even had some great suggestions which we incorporated into the surprise. Day-of, Billy and his staff were also extremely helpful dealing with champagne and plastic flute drop-off as well as hooking up my friend Ken (ring-bearer and master of ceremonies) and Allison (professional surprise engagement ninja photographer) with uniforms so that my then-girlfriend wouldn't suspect anything was out of the lip-smacking, finger-licking ordinary. \n\nThe photos speak for themselves, but the surprise went off without a hitch, not least of all because of the enthusiasm, whimsy and professionalism of Southern's staff. After the champagne was quaffed and the applause subsided, they even gave us matching Southern t-shirts to help commemorate the day.\n\nSo thank you Billy and the entire staff at Southern for rolling out the red carpet, to Ken Mao at Ful (www.facebook.com/eatful, @eatful) for being the master of ceremonies and Allison Slater photography (allisonslaterphotography.com, @allisonslaterphotography) for the amazing pics.

I opt for the thin crust, and the pizza is perfectly crispy. They have tons of unique flavor combinations to try!\nBUFFALO CHICKEN PIZZA // fried buffalo chicken, herbed white sauce, crumbled blue cheese, mozzarella + celery ($19.50) - I'm a sucker for anything buff chick, so this was a no brainer. I could have done without the celery - it was an odd add-on in my opinion, but the chicken was spicy and crisp. I asked for ranch to go with it :p\nTUSCAN SUN PIZZA // spinach, artichokes, roasted peppers, black olives, basil, + parmesan ($16.50) - A pizza unlike one I've had elsewhere. It was a unique combination of flavors that really elevated the traditional pizza. Really enjoyed the addition of basil on this pizza!\nSPINACH & ARTICHOKE DIP ($9.75) - SpinArt dip is typically always good. This was really creamy and plentiful, and was served with crisp tortilla chips. \nBLACK PEPPERCORN CAESAR w/ chicken // hearts of romaine, tomatoes, white cheddar, foccacia crouton + housemade peppercorn dressing ($14.50) - Good, not great. I'm a Caesar salad fiend, and while I enjoyed it, was it the best I've had? No. They were skimpy on the dressing for me (but they were more than happy to give me some extra!). The addition of tomatoes was nice, but I didn't DIE over the dressing. \n\nTuesdays are where it's at though. 2 for 1s on wine, beers, and liquor drinks.

Bubbly and knowledgeable about anything we asked her. \n\nWe ordered the livers to start. With two of their booze slushie drinks. I had s bourbon and chocolate style, she had a sort of ginger heavy mule. Both of which were bought quickly, and tasted amazing. For the mains, she ordered the chicken nachos, I ordered the hot chicken, both hot on the four step scale. The top of which is poultrygeist. I had to try it. So I ordered a side breast of it, just to not ruin the mains in case it was nuclear.\n\nFood arrived quickly. The livers are fried and tossed in a bang sauce, which isn't spicy but adds a really nice sticky texture to them. Making them a wonderful sharing app. Definitely too much for one person as a starter, but for two hungry people, they were perfect. Her main was great, the only thing she said was the pico on the nachos was mainly just tomato- not much cilantro or onion. I only tried a little of them and it didn't bother me. My hot chicken was served on bread, with pickles and slaw - really nice southern style. I'd also asked for a small Mac and cheese. The poultrygeist sat in a dish, on bread, alone...looking terrifying with a scotch bonnet chilli on a stick poking through it.\n\nI had some of my chicken first, it was cooked to perfection. Skin was crispy and very hot temperature and spice wise, but nothing the slaw and mac couldn't chill down, as you normally find with this style of food.

I took a massive bite of the awaiting monster....\nIt took maybe ten seconds.\n\"This is fine...wow it's so well spiced this tastes amazing...getting hotter...oh wow...yeah this was a bad idea...oh it's still getting hotter...my god...liquid, all of it now...\" cue me throwing back four ice slushies and all the water on the table. It's not the hottest thing I've ever tasted, I'm a fan of Indian food, but it's certainly one of the longest burns, and tastiest initial hits.

I like that they have kept some of their original menu items, but are always intruding new menu items to try each season. \n\nThey also have a poppin' happy hour with drink specials and $5 select appetizers which you know I'm all about. Their appetizer and dessert game is strong. My favorites are the artichoke spinach dip (obvious choice), the buffalo spring rolls, jazzy wings, and crab claws. As for dessert, you can't go wrong with Al's homemade cheesecake. \n\nWhat some people might find shocking is my favorite entree is the filet. Mainly because it's not well known as a steakhouse, but I'm here to tell you its one of the best tasting and well priced steaks in the city. They have always cooked it to a medium rare perfection. The creamed spinach or loaded baked potato are my go to side items with the steak. \n\nEvery fall they have a double cut pork chop and its 5 star restaurant quality. We love the bourbon glaze and the fresh seasonal vegetables it comes with. It's my husbands personal favorite.

Not disappointed in the food, but with myself. I thought I was extra hungry so I ordered the small version of the, Pulled Pork Fries as an appetizer. Their idea of small and my idea, are two different servings. I was stuffed like a Thanksgiving turkey after enjoying these fries. It was like nachos on crack. A mountain of crisp french fries was piled up on a quarter sheet tray and then covered with chili and pulled pork. That's off the chain! \n\nWhen I came back to try more of the menu, I got smart and skipped breakfast. It guaranteed I'd be extra hungry and have room for more food.  I knew I had to have more of that chili. So I started my lunch off with a cup. This is the type of chili I'd want on my Chili-Mac and perhaps a Slinger, too. \n\nToday I had a Brisket Sandwich. It was tender as tender could be. They get major bonus points with me for cutting theirs thick. I absolutely hate paper thin cut brisket. I'm a meat man and I want my meat, meaty. I also, liked the crisp edges around the brisket. As a side, I enjoyed more of their crip fries, without all the toppings. \n\nAs I chatted with Alex the Pit Master, I discovered all the sides are made in house. I will gradually work my way through them all. He gave me a sampling of the cole slaw and it was amazing. It has citrus juices in the dressing and it is like no other slaw in STL. \n\nThe Stellar Hog is not Alex's first rodeo. He was the original Pit Master at Adam's Smokehouse on Watson, so he definitely knows his way around a BBQ Pit.

I have worked at an upscale Asian restaurant here in town for about three years now, and since I started working there I have grown to love Asian food and culture. I enjoy finding new restaurants to try around the St. Louis area. I tried Asian Corner today and was blown away. \n\nI wanted to give it a fair shot, so I ordered their Thai Iced Tea, got their lunch special that came with my choice of fried or white rice, egg rolls or crab Rangoon's, and then miso soup and one of 20 options for 7.25!!!!!! I got spicy basil w/ beef! On top of that I got an order of Drunken Noodles. Drunken Noodles is one of my all time favorite dishes, so imagine my delight when the owner recommended it to me! \n\nIt was delicious. I ended up eating way more than I should have, only because it was so amazing. The restaurant is clean, the prices are great, the highest price they have is 9 dollars, and the lunch special is a great deal, the owner really loves and takes pride in his restaurant. He stopped to talk to me for a bit and he told me he finally opened this restaurant after 20 years of working in the restaurant industry.

The one girl even sold my friend a cookie- which was not the one my friend wanted. When my friend took it back inside, she told the girl and asked for the one she had originally chosen. The girl PUT the first cooking back in  the case for other people to choose!! WHAT?? How did she know my friend didn't touch it?  My friend is clean but what about the next person??

Seriously, we could have chilled there all day... and 7venth Sun was just one of at least five stops we had scheduled to make on that given day. \n\nIt was fairly early when we arrived there around 1pm, and grabbed spots at the bar. There taplist tended to sway more towards saisons, IPAs, and other citra-fronted ales; but additionally offered some darker-styled beers like stouts -- all of which I drank with impunity.\n\nAttempting to simply \"sample\", I started with a flight of five beers. Let me tell you, how they do flights are inventive, stylish, and cool. They have this art-deco-like stand in which they place five flute-shaped glasses into, filled with whatever you would like to drink. The flight presentation is one of the best I've ever seen at any brewery I have visited or frequented. \n\nFor my money, the Equatorial Farmhouse Sour IPA was pure awesomeness, while the Graffiti Orange Wheat Ale was refreshing and delicious. Additionally, their Partners in Crime Saison and Cat Daddy Stout were highlights during my first visit. With the over-15 beers they had on tap, I would have tried more had I not more breweries to visit. Like I said before, I could have just went there and been as happy as a fat kid in a candy store. \n\nThe people behind the bar were cool as fuck, being that I was getting quite loud and boisterous by the time I had knocked back my first flight of beer. The beertenders and managers were all patient and accommodating, and probably amused by our banter. Definitely, a fun place to go.\n\nAdditionally, 7venth Sun was the only place where I came home with some swag -- having bought both a brewery trucker's hat and their Mangrove t-shirt that glows in the dark. I liked the variety and options they offered with t-shirts and hats, so they won out over every other brewery I went to that weekend. \n\nFrom their beers to their taproom, 7venth Sun is a great place to go to enjoy American Craft Beer.

They have a pretty large selection of Mexican sodas though, (Sangrita, Boing, variety of Jarritos flavors, and others); I believe they do take credit cards (Visa/MC only).\n\nMake sure to look at the specials; these are usually some of the better items on the menu, especially their posole, which is insanely good, and their soups, which are ginormous.\n\nIn terms of the food itself, I'd focus primarily on tacos and their seafood dishes. The owner is from Veracruz, which is different from most Philly Mexican taquerias (from Puebla, where mole poblano originated from). The mole at El Jarocho is only so-so, as others have said, but I have good luck with all of their shrimp dishes, as well as most tacos, other than the pastor. I particularly like their pollo and chorizo tacos, as well as their jalapeno taco, which is stuffed with chicken inside. Also is a good place to get guacamole from. The barbacoa is also amazing...probably a step up from Mole Poblano's, which is also very good. Enchiladas are good too, especially verdes (I'd avoid mole).\n\nService is so-so, but for their prices and this type of place, that doesn't matter much. But in any case, this is a standby Mexican restaurant for me (I prefer Mole Poblano a bit over El Jarocho, but enjoy both; they do different things well).", "date": "2017-12-10 04:21:38"}, {"_key": "10086173", "_id": "reviews/10086173", "_rev": "_fNzD39e--A", "review_id": "YcrCyvmjCLtEhtY5OlI6rw", "user_id": "tc9WV6RouxZUR_cF-B764g", "business_id": "4BgT-dc_GMUOPdjHYJB_Bw", "stars": 1, "useful": 15, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "text": "Bravo Graphics and Winterfield Funding have the same address and suite number in Fort Worth TX.

I was pumped to see they offered frose however it melted quicker than anything I've drank before and in such a small champagne class offering. Breakfast is offered at all times which is always great. However, I ordered 2 eggs over medium, sourdough (they were out) so I got wheat, and a pancake. My friend also got a similar meal. \n\nAnother server brought out our food and this is where this all got interesting. The eggs were brought out with the toast AND grits (this was to be potatoes).  Even worse, these grits ran underneath the bread and eggs. Our pancakes we ordered separately were brought on same plate but the food runner quickly corrected that.  Once our server came over, we questioned the grits and he said that oh they ran out of the potatoes. Never ever asked us if grits were an ok substitute.  He proceeded to say he would correct this and never did. For eggs that were to be medium well had been so overcooked that the yoke was fully cooked and not dippy at all.  Never had a chance to even had that fix due to what happened after we got our meals. \n\nTo be exact, we never saw him again until he finally brought the bill (after my friend asked another server about getting our bill).  Our server brought the bill, said he wasn't hiding from us (really weird considering we never mentioned that so clearly he was avoiding our table for a good 15+ minutes) and that he was working on getting us hash browns. After he takes out check, the hash browns came out and we kindly rejected those since we had completely finished our meals and our table was cleared of plates. \n\nWe never had any follow up on how the food was, status of the hash browns, or if we needed/wanted any refills.  The server did comp the two drinks but really just a first bad impression. The wait time for good seems extremely long for a diner or for any restaurant in this area.  \n\nIt's new so I expect it'll adjust off feedback but for now, I'm not sure I'd recommend this place that I've been so excited to open up in the area.

My husband and I decided to try the tasting menu because that is what adventurous people do! The tasting menu was made up of a 6 course meal for $75 per person. Here is a breakdown of what we had:\n1.) Amouse Bouche - Roasted Mushroom and Barley Soup\nThe flavor was robust and quite nice! It was reminiscent of a sweet and sour soup. My husband and I aren't the biggest fan of mushrooms but these mushrooms had just the right amount of flavor and texture. We both enjoyed this as a way to whet our taste buds.\n\n2.) Butternut Squash Baklava\nI thought this dish was very creative. It was made up of pistachio, goat cheese, and truffle vinaigrette. It was presented like a dessert dish. The butternut squash added sweetness to the dish and enjoyed the flavors. I do wish they added a bit more crunch to the layers. Baklava is made from a flaky pastry. This dish seemed more like a sweet lasagna. I still enjoyed it nonetheless. \n\n3.) Seared Day Boat Scallops - escargot, seaweed pasta, and beurre rouge\nThis was my favorite dish from the tasting menu. The scallop was nicely seared. The seaweed pasta was out of this world! I thought I would be overwhelmed by the seaweed flavor, but that did not happen at all. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. The beurre rouge was buttery, rich, and just luxurious. So delicious! \n\n4.) Black Diamond Mussels - dashi, basil, ginger, bonito flakes\nThis dish captured the essence of the ocean. The dashi had a very seafood flavor, as it should! The bonito flakes add a great savory touch to the dish. I liked that this dish was simple so that you could enjoy the flavors of the ocean.\n\n5.) Duck three ways\nThis dish came with a roasted/panfried duck breast, duck prosciutto, and duck confit. I don't frequently eat duck so I don't think I appreciated this dish as much as I could. I felt like I was overwhelmed by the duck, because it has such a game-y flavor. This was a very heavy dish and by the time i ate everything off the plate, i was feeling stuffed.\n\n6.) Creekstone Farm Stiploin\nI enjoyed this dish quite a lot! The meat was cooked very well to a perfect medium rare. The foie gras sauce was absolutely delicious. I did notice that the blood from the meat had seeped into the potatoes, so there was a red pool that had formed at the bottom. This tells me that the meat should have rested a bit more. I still very much enjoyed this dish!\n\nWe had a palate cleanser sorbet before dessert was presented. It was a bit on the sweet side but it was delicious! \n\n7.) Poached pear stuffed with goat cheese. \nThe flavors that were presented for dessert were quite interesting. The more I ate it, the more I liked it. I liked that it was different and flavors I never had before. I do wish they sweetened the goat cheese a little bit because it felt almost like a sweet and savory dish and less like a dessert. \n\nOur server, Ali, was amazing! The ambiance is very cute and charming! I also felt like Sola Byob did a great job in terms of portioning the menu. By the time I finished everything, I felt satisfied. I did not feel so full to the point that the smell and look of food made me want to explode.

When did this stretch a.) get a name b.) get so many cool businesses? I know it's been a while since I lived in New Orleans but... wow! I'm impressed with the growth and development. And it's not just me: my native-but-moved-after-the-storm rideshare driver agreed with me that this area has boomed in the last [redacted] years.\n\nWhen I found out that Israeli food was on the menu for dinner, I was pretty psyched. The people who decide these things have deemed Israeli food to be on trend for 2018 and I wanted to get ahead of it. Plus, there aren't many Israeli options in my neck of the woods so I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. As soon as we walked in, I was impressed: the lighting, colors, table design, and layout of the restaurant are all very inviting. I felt comfortable and eager as soon as I sat. The good vibes continued with our waitress. She rolled up on our large, unruly group like a boss. She was undeterred with dietary issues, unphased by a ridiculous amount of questions and in an unchanged good mood throughout our meal. Kudos to you, ma'am. You're a leader. I couldn't have put up with the madness. Jus' sayin'.\n\nAware that I was in good hands, I got to the business of overeating and overdrinking. This is easy to do here as I didn't see *anything* that didn't look appetizing. Seriously. Everything looked good. Since I tend to eat in shifts, I'll lay out the progression of my piggishness. I always start with a cocktail. Tonight's choice was Aesop's Kylix. I don't know what a kylix is but after that drink, I'm all in for more. This was an addictive blend of bourbon, Greek brandy-wine, grapefruit, and cinnamon. I tried to savor it and be classy but I guzzled a bit more than I sipped. Since we had double the original cast of The Facts Of Life with us, it took forever for us to decide on, even, appetizers. This meant I needed another cocktail. I couldn't have starters without a drink, could I? I'm not an animal! My 1.5ish round found me with the All Of Our Troubles drink because of course. This was a combo of gin, lemon, lychee, brut ros\u00e9. Classy. Like, real classy and not klassy. I paired this with the salatim. At 3 for $15, it's a great value. I ordered the Lutenitsa (roasted pepper, eggplant, garlic,  and tomato puree), brussel sprouts (with black harissa, tahini and pickled onions) and Ikra (caviar with shallots) and did my level best not to share. In the midst of the eating, I tried many other starters (the curried cauliflower hummus is every bit as good as advertised). I had some FOMO at the moans of ecstasy coming from the pita eaters but I made a mental note to figure out a way to have revenge upon them later. I had food to concentrate on.\n\nThe main event came around and it was all about the market fish. The night's selection was swordfish and it was prepared with turmeric and ginger chraime (tomato-based sauce), spring onions and black lentils. As soon as I smelled it, I was smitten. Then I looked at it. Same reaction. By the time I tasted it, it was all about that dish and the cab I selected to accompany its journey to my belly. Are you kidding me?? If this is what Israeli food is all about, I'm going to need to have it on a monthly basis. This was one of the best meals I'd had in a very long time... and I was still swooning (and a bit tipsy) from my epic lunch. I completely understood why the restaurant was bursting at the seams with customers. I'd come back again and again.\n\nAch. New Orleans, very few places food like you. Now that I am back in the gym on a consistent basis, we need to get reacquainted.

Shaya garnered so many accolades that it was on top of my must-do list in NOLA. \n\nSad to report that it's overhyped. \n\nThe location is in the Garden District, a schlep from the Quarter-$20 cab ride. The interior is unfussily decorated, a bar with stools for patrons who don't have a rez, or solo, to linger on, no tablecloth service, very dimly lit at night, super casual, some tables have a banquette seating, and the patio was full on a chilly night, thanks to overhead heaters. A bit smelly, which is expected from the kebab house inspired menu.\n\nWe broke our fast, so-to-speak, with a trio of salatim: baba ganoush, ikra, i.e. taramasalata, and roasted Brussels sprouts, served with piping hot pide from the wood oven. All very fair. My favorite was ikra, paddlefish roe whipped with cream cheese. Baba was clean tasting, but needed a citrus punch, which can be said of many of the dishes on the menu. Roasted sprouts, served room temp over a smear of Harissa, were disappointing, somewhat undercooked. They could have benefited from a longer stay in the wood oven and a livelier sauce. \n\nFried haloumi, a childhood favorite, served with butternut squash pur\u00e9e and fennel salad, was all wrong. First, the room temp cheese. No, no, no! The morsels have to be hot to make your mouth burn. Butternut squash pur\u00e9e was way too sweet, a problem I have with Israeli cuisine in general. Too sweet, too cloying. \nIf a renowned chef puts falafel on their menu, I expect fabulous. Not the ones at Shaya. Too crunchy to the point of too hard for my teeth. The accompanying cabbage salad is very \u00e0 propos but super bland.\n\nTheir signature dish, roasted lamb shank, was our entree. Although I would have a hard time finding fault with the fall-off-the-bone, melt-in-the-mouth texture, the cloying sweetness doesn't help the dish. It comes with a yogurt sauce, flecked with a bit of dill and sumac. Yasss! \n\nOne last word about the pide! It should be thin, pouffy, with a bit of charring on top. Shaya's is too doughy and thick and misses the mark.\n\nThe service is professional, yet with only two servers in the main room, there were some delays. Our wine arrived half way into our appetizers. \n\nOne thing going for Shaya is that it is out of the box for New Orleans, a welcome addition to the repetitive Creole and Cajun glut that gets tired pretty quickly.

First when I call and tell them about my Shepherd, the woman literally laughed at me when I asked questions. Their price gouging ought to be criminal.They wanted close to $600.00 for an office visit, basic labs and  x-ray. When I asked what could be wrong with him; the vet said \"I have no idea \" shrugged his shoulders and left.I told them they were outrageously priced and asked for alternatives, to prioritize tests, and was given an alternative outpatient option of $385.00. The outpt option made no sense to me, there was no conversation, no discussion, pay or leave was the clear message. They gave us no instructions on how to care for him at home,what to watch for, nothing.\n\nUPDATE: Several hours after leaving the clinic we had to return with an unresponsive dog. The first thing the receptionist says to me as my Zeus lay motionless and limp in my son's arms is \"You declined everything before, what do you want us to do now?\"  The vet comes in to see him and says I don't know, I just don't know how his fever got so high so fast, how he got so bad so quickly, but he could die now, earlier maybe not. Well perhaps if someone actually communicated with me that he wouldn't make it until morning and he was that critical then I clearly would have done everything that could be done!! It is their complete indifference that I hold responsible for my dog's death. It is their negligence and a vet who very coldly said ahh I don't know what's wrong, but these tests are never a bad idea. Did not exactly inspire confidence in their ability to care for my dog nor convey any urgency to the situation. \n\nThe vet, Ortega made me pay the entire bill upfront BEFORE they would do anything. This spoke a volume to me about where their priorities lay. So after a few hours and around $1500.00 later, the vet says he is responding to the treatment, lifting his head and moving in the right direction. Relief. He then says we discharge between 6:30-7. I asked what do we do then? He replies go to your own vet. But they do t open for another hour,go sit in their parking lot he tells me. My son went back to get Zeus, he was EXACTLY the same as when we brought him in, he wasn't lifting his head or responding, he was clearly a few breaths away from dying and they just kicked him out. They used water spray to cool his temp down and sent him out soaking wet, leaking stool, dripping blood from his nose- no towel, no blanket, nothing. the receptionist did ask if I wanted a towel for the seat;She hands me a soaking wet towel, this was the one we had under him here. Are you kidding me, you all couldn't give him a clean towel or blanket??!!! \n\nWe then went and sat in the parking lot of my vet and in the hour he lived, my vet's office showed him more compassion and love than this Emergency Clinic. After he passed and I went to pay the bill at MY vet's, the only charge I had was for his private cremation. They didn't charge me for any of the interventions they did or care delivered. In contrast, the emergency clinic DOUBLED the office fee bc it was after midnight! They just seen him a few hours prior so I paid 84$ + 185$ just for the visits alone!!! An ounce of decency would have suggested that the extra office call fees of $185 could easily be waved. $1500.00 later that vet, Ortega, still couldn't give me any idea of what was wrong with my dog. I am a registered nurse and I knew what the labs were indicating but he seemed to be clueless, absolutely clueless.\n\nI must say though, that my vet said they were very aggressive with their efforts to save him but it was too late by then. It devastates me to know that the options for emergency care for our pets is so very limited and price gouged as I hear the clinic across the street has the same attitude but charge even more so I guess these guys believe they are a bargain! Little things would have made all the difference, compassion, showing us that you cared about our Zeus, communicating the treatment plan and not just handing me a fee page of totals, and working with families who can't afford your outrageous prices. Giving him a blanket or towel to wrap him in, those little simple things. \n\nI would have swallowed the fees if I felt in any way that you all were competent and cared at all about pup. But now he is gone.

I'll start by saying that communication between their staff and customers is extremely poor. As a consumer, we visually and verbally communicated what we would like to have done with our doors. We trusted that staff would properly write down our wishes. The contract consists of numbers and letters which are unfamiliar to the consumer but our wishes were reverberated back to us ensuring our wishes would be fulfilled. When the doors arrived, it was not what we had discussed, but because the special numbers and letters weren't on the contract (we took for granted the staff wrote down what we wanted), they didn't try and make it right. \nI'll walk you through our unpleasant experience with this company. First, one staff member started the contract with us and then the owner Darrin took over, having no communications with his staff member as to what was going on. Throughout the process of waiting for the doors, we were told we could have our locks keyed the same to all doors and to bring in the door hardware to the store to have locks keyed. When we arrived to the store to drop off our door hardware, the owners father was there and said he would leave a message for the staff. We never received a call back. Furthermore, we sent multiple emails asking what our 10ft door hardware would look like, we never got response other than \"bronze\". When asking specifics about the door handle, there was no response. This is what I mean about communication, no one in that office delivers messages or communicates, therefore the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing.\nThe day prior to our scheduled appointment, no one from the business called us to confirm our appointment. At 2pm, I began to worry because of the previous experience we had with their communication, so I called their office and they said, yes we will be there tomorrow at 7:30am. It was 8:30am on installation day and no one had showed up so we call the office and they said \"oh they should be there, they just left the office\". It wasn't until 9:15 that the workers showed up. As we confronted them about the time, the workers stated they didn't have all their materials to do the job and they had to stop at Home Depot. Not once did we receive a courtesy call stating they would be late, which would have satisfied any customer. The workers were scheduled for one day of work to install 3 doors. The workers showed up with two doors and partially installed those two doors. Screws were missing from the hinges and we had to keep telling them to insert the missing screws. The missing screws didn't match the color of all the other screws. The hinges to our 10ft door did not match the hardware to the \"bronze\" door hardware that we kept trying to get information on. They didn't have the sweep or the weather striping to one of our doors. As the workers \"completed\" the two doors, they told us they would be back tomorrow to install the third door. We were scheduled for only one day of work. No one communicated to us that this would take multiple days for installation until they were here, making it inconvenient for us. The owner's reasoning for not having the third door was because the third door wasn't finished...did we receive a courtesy call from the business stating the door wasn't done? You guessed it, no we didn't. On the second day of installation, the owner showed up to stain our third door. We wanted to address several things with him. We asked him to activate the self closing hinges on our fire proof door yet he was unfamiliar with the process as he had to YouTube how to do so. The door knob was loose on one of our doors and when we asked the owner about it, he stated, that is maybe how it might have to be, but I can take a look at it. We also asked if we could change our door hardware since we didn't have the opportunity to pick it, yet we asked about it before installation and did not receive any feedback. The owner was reluctant to help exchange the door knob and was more interested in receiving a full payment to fulfill a \"completed contract\". We also asked the owner about being able to get the hinges to our 10ft. door to match the door knob. He said sure. Two weeks later, workers show up with the wrong color hinges. We waited another three days to finally receive the right color hinges. \nOverall, this was an extremely painful and unpleasant experience and I absolutely felt like I settled. Dealing with poor employees can be expected and it is not unreasonable to speak with the owner or manager, however with this company, the worst part is the owner, Darrin. The installers did their best with what they had, they were friendly and hard working but because of poor communication and direction from the owner, this is the type of experience you can expect.", "date": "2017-12-01 17:35:47"}, {"_key": "10103071", "_id": "reviews/10103071", "_rev": "_fNzD4ou--L", "review_id": "Mf73JisNM0xt5wUOYB6ARg", "user_id": "xQfNbdM0QD9FHYE07Nq-5Q", "business_id": "PiQVIJI92Z9O37jg9YMyPw", "stars": 1, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Wish I could tell you about the food and spirts .. however due to their lack of customer service and technology I can't.

When we learned the previous owners, Philip and David were retiring and the property was under new management - we decided to keep our reservation as we loved the property so much. We had a couple of conversations with Diane, the new property manager, prior to our stay. She bragged about the new updates with the decor and the hot breakfast served daily. We were open minded and optimistic. However, we ended up being so disappointed with our stay. \nFirst of all, Diane greeted us when we arrived, however there was the major lack of availability and personal touch we were accustomed to with Philip and David. \nI found the \"updates\" to the B&B to be more lacking than upgrading, making the huge property feel more empty and plain. Our usual room's heavy dark curtains were replaced with white, sheer curtains... which led to way too much sunlight beaming in during the mornings. After being out late enjoying New Orleans, this was very annoying making sleeping in impossible. \nWe have ALWAYS had daily house keeping at every B&B we have ever stayed - including Royal Street. After three days of NO room service, towels piled on the floor, trash overflowing, my husband confronted Diane. She said housekeeping wasn't done until we left. How do you stay a week in a B&B without any kind of house keeping??? When my husband asked her for fresh towel, Diane didn't even know where they were and had to take them out of an unused room. She told him where to take out the trash... but the cans had been moved, so he had to hunt them down. The aggravating part is we had to pay a higher price than we were previously quoted, due to new management fees and having to register through AirBnB. You would have thought they would have at least gave us fresh towels and emptied the trash can. \nThe new hot breakfast was a joke. \nThe first day I went down - 45 min after the dining room opened (1 hour 15 min before it closed), there was barely anything left and what was still there was cold and dry. No management was on property to help. The crock pot of grits was so watery it was inedible. I found a bag of grits in the cabinet to add to the crock pot to make them edible. \nA couple came down as I was stirring the grits and was disappointed as well at the lack of advertised \"hot breakfast\". They had no idea where to go... so I had to guide them to some breakfast places in the neighborhood to eat. It was infuriating because pervious owners always gave everyone a map of local places to go and to eat at check in. \nAfter several days of trying this \"new and improved breakfast\", I gave up. Terrible every time.\n\nI wish you would stop advertising yourself as a traditional B&B because in reality this place is now an AirB&B. We stay in traditional B&Bs because we LOVE the personal touch and care. Phillip and David poured their heart and soul into what they did and that is why they had such a huge clientele. \nWith the new management being how it is, we will never stay at Royal Street Courtyard again.", "date": "2017-12-29 04:26:10"}, {"_key": "10103788", "_id": "reviews/10103788", "_rev": "_fNzD4qa--J", "review_id": "AH-JgMcpF2sLI9rpTjD_Vg", "user_id": "aRIwtRfgPx4Acdfc_9Uh4w", "business_id": "8O9heKiCbSTKSRyUXZndSw", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Del Prado is essentially 19 Bella.

I've heard the horror stories of 4 and 5 hour waits so I was prepared to be disappointed when I got there. We went on a Saturday night at 9pm. We had a little trouble finding a parking spot so I thought it would be a bad wait when we got inside. \n\nFirst timers- sign up for your membership card online! We got to skip the longest line and get a bay before the 25 or so people that were waiting in line for their card because we all had cards. Miraculously, we got in with NO wait. Crowded as can be but no wait! Luck was definitely on our side. And here is the major customer service points -- we only had our cards online and normally they do make you wait in that long line to have it printed (but normally you have to wait for the bay, so it's a kill two birds with one wait type of thing). But because our bay was available now, they opened up a computer especially for our group to get our cards printed right away. Talk about service!! \n\nOnce we were on the bay, we were also very satisfied. It was a cold December night but the strong heaters made us feel comfortable without coats. Service for food and drinks was pretty good. A little less prompt than we would like, but we were having a good time and they were busy so it wasn't a huge deal. \n\nAs for the golfing part, I have NEVER golfed in my life. I was absolutely terrible and had no idea what I was doing, but it was still an awesome time. I would definitely come back despite my total lack of skill. If you have a good group to hang out with, having absolutely no idea how to golf isn't a big deal. \n\nWe did notice when we left around 11pm that the place had CLEARED out.

It's one of my favorite Italian restaurants in Boise. And so I was looking forward to their smaller place opening up right next to the footbridge that crosses the Boise River between Quinns Pond and the Esther Simplot Park.\n\nA couple came in and sat down and the first thing they did was scoot their table toward an empty table to give them some space from their neighbors. The woman wasn't satisfied, so she then traded places with her male companion.\n\nThey seemed settled, but a few minutes later, the woman raised her arm to shield her eyes from the bright sun shining through a sort of garage door window without any shades.\n\nAnother few minutes went by and they asked if they could move to another table that was just emptied. They brought their food over and sat down out of the path of the sun. They seemed satisfied there.\n\nI was frankly disappointed by Caffe Luciano's menu. I knew it was scaled down from the Orchard Street eatery, but I didn't expect they would have nary a pasta dish there: a three-cheese lasagna with meat sauce, stuffed manicotti and chicken cannelloni.\n\nThe rest of the menu consisted of pizza, sandwiches, salads and several different appetizers. \n\nThere really wasn't anything that called out to me. I didn't want a pizza for lunch and the appetizers, priced at $8 to $14 with one going for $19, were as much as the entrees.\n\nI ordered an Italian sub, with salami, capicola, mortadela, lettuce, red onions, tomatoes and a Kalamata tapenade.\n\nThe meats were fine. Capicola is my favorite deli meat and one that takes some searching to find. I was glad to see them have it. Insider tip: It's 50 times better than pepperoni on a pizza and unlike the latter, you can actually find it in Italy. Pepperoni was an American invention.\n\nThe sandwich came on a thick artisan bun but it was so thick it was hard to chew. It would have been better grilled or at least warmed. \n\nFor a $1 extra I got a Caesar salad instead of the house salad that came with the sandwich. I've never seen a slice of lemon provided for a Caesar salad. I would have rather seen some anchovies, the traditional accompaniment. \n\nThe tables were so close together that my waiter, a skinny man, had to raise his arms to move through the narrow spaces. It was also comical to watch, because I knew as I watched him he would raise his hands. Every time.\n\nAs Michelle noted in her photo caption, this brand new restaurant, constructed from the ground up, is extremely to people with mobility problems.\n\nWhen you come inside, there were only a couple of tables on that level. All of the other tables, in what is a fairly small space anyway, can only be reached by going down a few steps. \n\nSomeone in a wheelchair would have trouble eating here, unless they moved someone sitting at one of the upper tables. Or they crawled over an outside enclosed railing, had someone lift their wheelchair over and came in through the door leading to the outdoor deck. \n\nService was fine. \n\nI have no doubt this restaurant will be a hit. It's in a perfect place to draw people who have come to the pond or Simplot park. It's just a short walk over the orange bridge.\n\nThat may be the easiest way to get there. The restaurant itself has no parking spaces but I was able to find a spot a few feet away in front of the housing development next door.

And that's not the only terrifying thing that happened. \n\nThe trail guide, Emily, who did our ride, displayed appalling judgment on several occasions that could have exposed my daughter and me and others to serious danger. This was an absolutely terrifying experience. My daughter, who is an accomplished rider, was crying and terrified and swore she'd never get back on a horse after all the things that happened. \n\nThere is a place called TRAK that is run by a man who takes *the* most meticulous care with his horses, trainers and riders I've ever seen. Go there instead. \n\nIf you want to hear the full account of what happened, read on.\n\nI was there with my daughter, her friend who had never ridden before, her friend's mom and two other girls. The first terrifying thing to happen was that Emily guided a horse up to the mounting block and told one of the girls to step up to the block and get on the horse. The girl got her left foot in the stirrup and suddenly the horse moved back and left the block, with the girl hanging on. There was an audible gasp from everyone looking on. Then Emily, instead of promptly taking that horse back to the stables and getting another one for the girl, guided the horse back to the block, told it to quiet down, and then told the now terrified girl to try getting on again! I was stunned at this serious lapse in judgment. The horse was jittery and wouldn't stand still. Emily had to talk to it several times before it calmed down. Finally, after a few minutes -- LONG before which it was obvious to everyone watching that using this horse was NOT a good idea -- Emily finally took the horse back to the stables and came back with another horse, which the girl mounted fine.\n\nThen in the middle of our trail ride, my daughter's friend's horse suddenly bucked its back legs and she pitched forward face first onto the ground. The little girl was bent over in a great deal of pain and her mom was near tears and worried she's broken a rib. The mom got off her horse and Emily walked us all to a place where a truck picked up the girl and her mom. We waited for a good 15 minutes for the truck to appear, which was also quite surprising. How do they not have a more responsive plan for emergencies like this?\n\nThen the remaining riders headed home, and you'd think with that kind of scare, the terrifying moment was passed. \n\nNope.\n\nFor some completely incomprehensible reason, Emily took the reigns of her horse and of the mom's horse *and let the horse who bucked the girl off go free* and walk with the other horses along the path. How that makes *any* sense I do not know. Because here's what happened next: Chappo, the horse who bucked the girl off, suddenly broke from the trail and ran off and then came back and starting rolling around on the ground right in front of my daughter, its legs flailing dangerously close to my daughter's horse. Emily was up ahead on the trail and she turned back and saw what was happening and told us not to pay attention to Chappo, that he was just rolling around having fun, and then told my daughter to just navigate around him.\n\nNavigate around a horse who was rolling around on the ground, legs flailing?\n\nWas she insane?\n\nAnd then Chappo stood up and REARED up on his hind legs, and both my horse and my daughter's got very jittery. I was terrified that Chappo was going to make the other horses spooked and we'd get bucked off also. Finally I yelled up to Emily to please deal with Chappo, and that's when she got off her horse and finally made the decision she should have made at the beginning, which was to tie up the extra horses to trees so we could all ride back in peace.\n\nWhen we finally got back to the stables and dismounted, I was shaking from the fear and adrenaline -- and I am not easy to spook or scare.\n\nI did talk to the owner about this incident, but when my mom spoke to the owner of Trak and shared this story, he said he wasn't surprised because he can tell they don't take the best care of their horses, and likely Chappo had a burr under his saddle that caused him to buck and also roll around on the ground.\n\nIf you value your life, stay away from this place.

I had done my Yelp research and bookmarked all the cool spots in town with Toddy's as #3 on our road map. \n\nOur first couple stops were nothing but beautiful disappointment and then after passing up the entrance to the Santa Barbara Bowl (where it is located), twice, we arrived at adorable little Toddy's. The sweet little lights mixed with the rustic Christmas Trees sign, and the kiddie area with antique bikes and tea pots were just too much for me to handle. \n\nI was shocked at the wide variety of smaller sized trees they had in stock because of our failed luck at the previous locations. We were looking for something from 4 - 6 feet but more on the smaller side with a lot of lush to it. My friends wandered the grounds smelling all the wonderful varieties and I went straight to the tree I called destiny. It smelled like Christmas morning and gleamed at me with it's newly water branches in the moonlight. I fell in love. \n\nBecause Toddy and his helper had to run to the bank, we put the tree on hold and came back 30 minutes later. They then trimmed the trunk, nailed on the base, and carefully helped me load in it my car. On the way to the pay desk there were adorable white lawn chairs, tons of holiday themed decor and even \"Reindeer Food\" for sale in little $2 baggies. They thought of it all!\n\nWith such a perfect tree, kind and helpful service, a wide variety of sizes and smells, a massive parking lot to hold many customers at once, and all the adorable decor additions - Toddy's was the perfect place to spend December 1st and create a holiday memories that will last a lifetime.

Since we were in serious discussion about marriage, we went together, and the staff was super welcoming while my now wife got sized and whittled her picks of styles down to 3-5 rings (men everywhere, i suggest you do the same for both your own ease and the guarantee of her satisfaction...as a side note, she never again  wants to wear the style she initially wanted after trying it on). Her information and choices were kept on file, and again, they could not have been better months later when I picked out the ring. Again, a reasonable price to invest my love into, and a stellar product. The absolute same could be said about the wedding bands we picked from there as well.\nWe had arranged to get a cleaning for her engagement ring two days before the wedding, and by our own error, arrived ever so slightly behind, with the front door locked and the gate down while employees closed up shop. Lo and behold, our saleswoman/rockstar goddess of the jewels Gigi comes out with Mr Singer himself. Steven was willing to allow us into the second floor lounge while they did an expedited cleaning for us after hours. Nobody complained, they remained friendly, and yes...they still gave me a beer while we waited. Shit, Gigi ran into the restaurant she saw us at afterwards and hung out for five minutes!\nThis isnt about billboards and radio appearances (although Steven could use some help while singing on Preston & Steve)...this is about people who seem to genuinely care. About the customer, about the community, about how they represent both....all with an outstanding, beautiful product that likely doesnt cost as much as youve been telling yourself as the reason for not going. Much, much love to Gigi, Steven, and the whole business...from someone who had every reservation about going into a well-known jewelry store and possibly paying a lot more than I wanted to. ~Joey & Kellie McIntyre", "date": "2017-12-28 00:51:10"}, {"_key": "10122145", "_id": "reviews/10122145", "_rev": "_fNzD5Vi--A", "review_id": "Lpy95PJMHLd711tJKcPADQ", "user_id": "alG_yoOLD8HK4WBJnEz1dw", "business_id": "PTLEyRWXnVg3LaILZM30JQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 2, "cool": 0, "text": "Working with RentVest at the Reno location has been a pleasure.
