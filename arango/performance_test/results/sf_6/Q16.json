Ive been here hundreds of times in the past for dinners, banquets, and weddings. Now, with the many other places in Chinatown, there really is no reason to go here. Over the years, Joy Tsin Lau has been slowly declining for many terrible and avoidable reasons. \n\nThe service has become abysmal. The workers seem terrified of the owners and managers. They are constantly and publicly yelling at their employees and at customers. They refuse to cater to their patrons and are openly rude and dismissive. Even when my family specifically asked for rice or water, they kept giving us reasons as to why they shouldnt. When putting dishes onto the table, they would hit my family members or slam them onto to the table. They kept taking away our tea cups and tea pot even though we were using them. \n\nAnd the food was awful. Everything tasted like fake chinese food. Nothing was good or tasted like it should. There were dishes that werent apart of what we ordered but they tried to pass it off as it was, even when we asked about it. Seafood dishes were sorely overcooked. Everything was terrible from the atmosphere, the service, to the food. \n\nTo too it all off, this restaurant appeared in headlines everywhere in 2015 for causing one of the largest foodbourne illness outbreaks by sickening over 100 patrons. They have also had dozens of other health violations over the last few years. I understand that places mess up sometimes, but this is surely a sign of an underlying internal issue. \n\nDo not eat here. There are so many better options, elsewhere.

The manicure was sloppy, wrong color, and very rushed. He wouldn't address the issue of it being the wrong color.\n\nAnd the owner could see I was upset and did nothing. The Nail House must be 150 yards from them. There are too many nail salons in the area, you would think they would be concerned about customer service\n\nUPDATE 4-28-2018\n\nI had an appt at 11:00 am. Got there and the tech was in the beginning of another person. She was taking the foil off her gel nails. The man told me to wait 15 min.  I DONT THINK SO\n\nWe make appts for a reason. I had other appts that day. I always have to wait  at least 10 min. I'm sick of it.  And he couldn't believe I wouldn't wait ten fifteen minutes. It was the principle of it. I shouldn't HAVE to wait bc they took someone right before my appt time.\n\nSo I went to The Nail House They took me right away.\n\nBad business. I really enjoyed Liz.

We decided to give the location another try since they were offering a coupon for the Countdown room, and hoped this experience would make us want to return for the other rooms.  I wish we had stuck to our gut and not gone back at all.  Countdown was even worse than Bates Manor, and it honestly was the worst \"escape room\" I've seen in my 2  1/2  years and 25+ rooms.  I use quotes because I don't believe this can even be considered an escape room.  If it was my first experience with an escape room I never would've done another.  \n\nThe experience starts off with an abrasive and, frankly, sexist \"admiral\" yelling instructions at you about North Korean missiles.  The premise is both too real and too ridiculous in a way that majorly detracts from any immersion that the set provides.  The admiral continues to yell at you and use offensive idioms throughout the adventure under the premise of updating your orders and helping the mission.  It's 2018; there is no excuse for the use of \"off like a prom dress in May\" in any context.  In addition to being loud and uncomfortable, the admiral eats up time while you wait for him to finish the same instructions that eventually appear on screen.  On the subject of time, there is NO REASON for the timer to be counting down in only seconds.  No one, not even the military, refers to an hour as 3600 seconds and only counts down in seconds.  If Bates wanted a clock that would raise the stakes for players and manufacture a sense of urgency then one should be programmed to rapidly count down the milliseconds as well as displaying the minutes and seconds.\n\nI will say that the decor is very immersive.  Bates Escape never seems to skimp on the set decorations that make their rooms transport you to wherever you're supposed to be.  In most cases that is a great thing, but in this room it seems to actually hinder game play.  Poorly lit rooms are burdened with a multitude of superfluous props that just wastes time instead of actually adding a difficulty level to the game.  Fifteen minutes into the game I already no longer cared about even finishing and just wanted out.  \n\nIf you are interested in a submarine simulation that involves repeatedly following the same set of instructions while being yelled at and having extremely loud alarms sound in your ear, then this is the room for you.  If you're interested in an actual escape room that involves solving clever puzzles then I would steer clear.  We counted a total of 2 puzzles that actually needed to be solved.  Everything else was just guessing or following step by step instructions.  If I wanted to follow written instructions to the letter I would've put together an Ikea bookshelf.  It probably would've been more mentally challenging.  The real tragedy is the ease with which the rooms at Bates could be some of the best around.  Marrying technology into an escape room should make a fun experience with a sense of accomplishment.  This was an entire room of \"ok fine, what's next...\".  There were no \"a-ha\" moments and no pride at figuring anything out.  We will not return to Bates Escape.", "date": "2018-11-20 20:17:51"}, {"_key": "10001140", "_id": "reviews/10001140", "_rev": "_fNzDwLK--E", "review_id": "Xl5cq1ltcoxOIja65w2PgA", "user_id": "-kLVfaJytOJY2-QdQoCcNQ", "business_id": "Gkfi3qXHH_FHvJ0_omUztg", "stars": 2, "useful": 15, "funny": 3, "cool": 5, "text": "The food is hot but drive thru can take a while. \n\nWe ended up here after a concert because Arby's closes at 11 p.m. - sad.

Almost immediately, before my visit started,  an x-ray tech told me she wanted to take x-rays, even lthough I told her I brought a new MRI and x-rays from a few years ago.  She proceeded to take x-rays of my spine while in my street clothes, meaning the metal zipper on my high waisted pants would obscure part of the view of my spine.  Standard parameters on the American College of Radiology website state \"You will be asked to remove some of your clothes and to wear a gown during the exam. You may also be asked to remove any metal objects or clothing that might interfere with the x-ray images.\" Afterwards, when seen by the Physician's Assistant, the x-rays they took weren't shown to me or discussed. Only the MRI that I brought was briefly shown to me.  I wasn't asked to change into a gown for an \"exam\" either, nor was my spine/back examined in any detail.  I was asked to bend forward and backward, sit and lift my legs and push them against the PA's hand, checking for strength or lack thereof.  A test for lack of feeling in my lower legs was done through my pant leg and knee socks, not against my skin.  After this minimal \"exam\" and after relating my complex history as briefly as possible, the PA said, \"So, do you want surgery?\"  Really?  I'm supposed to be the judge of when surgery is indicated?  Apparently, saying yes to surgery would have been the only way for me to be seen by the Orthopedic Surgeon, who, in my opinion, should be the one giving me an \"expert\" opinion as to whether or not I need surgery.  It's one thing to have a preliminary exam by a PA at a physician's office, and it's another thing to rely ONLY on a PA for an exam and treatment of a very complex issue.

I get up to the counter and one of the managers takes my order. I order the 8 count nuggets and medium fry. She's multi-tasking, again not even looking at me and she says something to me. I said excuse me, since I didn't understand what she said, and she repeated herself, \"do you want the meal?\" And I say no drink, just the nuggets and the fries, like I ordered the first time. I then pay and I move to the side to wait for my order. It's pretty busy as it's lunch time so there is a quiet a few people waiting for their food. I wait a few minutes and then move myself closer to the counter where they are handing out the orders at I knew my order must me coming up soon. I wait, but my name is not called. I then start seeing people that were behind me in line start receiving their food. I notice them calling out a lot of sandwiches so I think to myself they must be making more nuggets, so I keep waiting. Still my name is not called. And as I'm waiting this entire time I've been right next to the counter so I'm clearly visible to the employees that I'm waiting AND the manager that took my order is now handing out the food, and this whole time she doesn't even glance my way or notice I've been standing there for probably 10 minutes now. I finally realized they clearly skipped my order so I say something to the manager next time she comes to the counter \"Excuse me, do you know if my order is coming for Amanda, an 8 count nugget and medium fry?\" Again she seems too preoccupied to pay attention and she says \"uhhh one sec.\" I then see her go over to the monitor with the orders on it and flipping through it trying to find my order. Then she tells another employee to ask me what my order is again, and I repeat again \"8 count nugget and medium fry for Amanda\". The manager finally gets my food together and hands it to the other employee to give to me. The employee says \"sorry bout that, we gave you a 12 count nugget instead. Any sauce?\" I said no and walked away with my food. Very disappointing service from Chik-fil-a today. And even more disappointing that the manager that took my order and then messed it up didn't even apologize.

Finally, this last Halloween, we were able to make it work. \n\nSlaughter House is held at Greater Nevada Field, which is where the Reno Ace's play. They offer the usual Haunted House experience and a Haunted Train attraction (more on that later). Considering if you purchased both attractions together (and getting access to the faster line) it would be cheaper, we decided to go that route. Afterwards, we wish we just went with the Haunted House. \n\nWe waited in line for around 30 minutes before getting into the House and all in all, it was alright. Sure, it had moments that made me jump and even freaked me out a bit, but all told it just wasn't that great. There's one portion of the House where you're forced to walk through a ball pit that features a \"scary\" Clown to add to the discomfort. Normally, there would be nothing wrong with that. But, what is wrong with it is my wife has a very bad ankle and it could be rolled very easily. There was no warning at all about having to walk through a ball pit where rolling your ankle wouldn't be too difficult. So considering I was highly annoyed by this and focused on making sure my Wife didn't get hurt, it took any and all \"scare\" out of this portion. To his credit, the actor playing the Clown picked up on this and backed off. That was cool of him. \n\nAs soon as it started, it ended. I felt like there was no grand finale or anything like that, you just suddenly left the maze and that was that. Pretty flat if you ask me. Oh, and the first thing they do upon entering the Haunted House is take your picture along side a creepy actor. It's your usual tourist trap type thing with them pitching you to purchase said picture at the end. Full transparency though, I bought it. Lol. It actually turned out to be a good photo of me and there aren't very many of those. Lol. \n\nNow here's the portion of the review where things really take a turn for the worst. The Haunted Train. It was probably the saddest thing I've ever experienced. The train carts are stupid small and cramped (it became apparent to me at this point that kids were the primary target audience for this), they played music by the band \"Disturbed\" (probably its only redeeming quality), and they attempted to scare you while you passed by Coke a Cola and Hot Dog vendor carts. Super scary. They didn't even TRY to cover these. I was able to spot the scare actors coming a mile away. It just flat out sucked, ok? The little kids on the ride weren't even scared. They either need to completely revamp this or scrap it all together. Seriously bad. Don't bother wasting your hard earned money on this. \n\nSo the reason for the 2 stars is the fact that the Haunted House (the main attraction) was just ok and had a flat ending, the Train ride sucked, and the fact that a female Security Guard (at the main line entrance) could be heard by all of us in line talking a whole mess of sh*t about customers. Now,  I used to work in Customer Service and I hated every minute of it, so I completely understand how stupid and rude the general public can be. However, you NEVER talk about customers RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM. That's just asinine even to me.  If you hate it, then do what I did. Go get a job where you don't have to deal with them. Problem solved. Also, all told, we spent north of $50 for the attractions and I'm sorry but for what you get, that's too much. It just wasn't worth the cost. \n\nSo all told, there's a good chance that this was our first and final visit unless they make some big changes. We're more than likely going to opt to do something in Virginia City for Halloween this year. Then one upside to all this? Parking was free in the garage across the street.

I don't know if they were having an off day or what - but I was not impressed at all. I came in an hour before closing for brunch with my sister. Opened the menu and the first thing I notice is the big block in the menu saying not to complain to followers about bad experience in the restaurant. I thought that was weird. The interior is beautiful I'll give them that; it's definitely a good atmosphere to brunch in and trendy towards what is popular nowadays. \n\nThe waitress was nice but I got a little confused when she told us the coffee was self serve before we ordered. I thought she meant coffee was included or something since we did not order coffee. Thankfully I asked and she clarified it wasn't included.\n\nI ordered a hot chocolate (steep at $4.50 but hey, treat yo' self!) and the croissant french toast. My hot chocolate came slightly overflowing which was messy but not something I would complain about... it seems a waste to have them make me another one just because it overflowed. Taste was below average, it tasted like the instant hot chocolate packs you can buy from the grocery store. I expected more for the price point. My croissant french toast tasted good I'll give them that, but the appearance was off putting as it came out as a flat hunk of dark colored something. When I looked at pictures afterwards I found that the amount of nuts on my entree was really small compared to other people's. Disappointing.\n\nOverall, even though my french toast tasted fine I wouldn't recommend this place for brunch just because of the price point. Restaurants come down to taste and if I'm shelling out the big bucks for basic items they need to be out of this world. Some places can do it, sadly Cafe Patachou didn't do it for me. If their food taste and quality improved it would be worth it but sadly it didn't pay off taste wise for me. You could get similar at other places for much less money. \n\nOh - I don't mind cleaning, I used to work in food service after all and I know how it is, but they set up the coffee right next to our table while they cleaned which was not the best atmosphere as people were coming and going next to our table. The restaurant was mostly empty so it seemed an odd spot to put it. The smell of the floor cleaner was kind of strong for me which also made our visit less pleasant.

It took us more than an hour to get our sushi rolls because the cook was busy with another table. Then the miso soup was piss poor, and when they brought out the salads, which was only enough for about 4 bites.\n\nWe had someone with a shell fish allergy and it was made clear on more than one occasion. So they cooked her chicken before he put the shrimp and scallops on the grill. He still tried to put shrimp on her plate after she told him 3 times NO!!! She had to yell at him for him to finally realize why she was yelling NO! He kept having to look at his order sheet and didn't look like he knew what he was doing.\n\nIt took us 3 hours to finally get our entrees cooked and we were disappointed in the food because it was bland!! The sushi tasted like it was frozen because it was decently chewy, I am a huge sushi fan and this fell flat on it's face.\n\nI can tell you that we will NEVER be coming back and I will make sure that I never recommend this place to anyone unless they want to spend all night waiting for their frozen sushi. I would have walked out half way through but because we were with guests, we stayed to keep them company. I was so irritated by everything tonight.

I invited 10 of my friends to join me for my birthday.\n\nMy friend called in and made a reservation for 10 at the cooktop table for Saturday at 6pm.  When the first of us arrived, they said they had no reservation.  My friend showed them her phone where she had spoken to someone for several minutes at the restaurant and they apologized for not having the reservation and seated the couple that were there.  When four of my party had arrived, the young waiter came and asked if we knew how many would be eating All you can eat.  They told us we would have to arrange our seating so that those who did not order all you can eat not sit with those who do.  Once everyone was there, we polled our group and all of us except for one was getting all you can eat.  One person only wanted a drink and dessert as she had a late lunch.  After a little arguing they allowed her to stay in her seat (did it really matter where she sat if she was the ONLY one not ordering BBQ?).  \n\nAs the food started to arrive, we were all very excited.  The waiter had a hard time figuring out where to place all of the side dishes.  Most of them tasted pretty good, in my opinion.  The meats arrived and they seemed fresh and we started to cook. (We were given no direction on times on the cooktop and it is very dark in the restaurant, so it is difficult to determine when meat is done cooking, just fyi).  We got one serving of meats and our server came back one time and asked what we'd like refilled and then never returned.  One friend ordered a drink and that took 40 minutes to arrive.  Our Rice came about 40 minutes after meat.  Another ordered an ice cream and that never arrived.  At 7:30 we had to call and cancel our other plans, yet we still had not been re-visited.  No water or soda refills, nothing.  \n\n\nAnother large group was sat just behind us and the same waiter was attentively working on their table.  \n \nJust before 8:00, the waiter came by and told us that one of us would need to pay for the whole bill and have our friends pay us back, which of course we refused because none of us wanted to pay $300 for our $30 meal.  He said this was because it would take \"15 minutes\" to split the checks.  All of us had the same all you can eat BBQ with a soda added and one person got a side dish and another ordered an alcoholic drink.  Plus the one who got a drink and a fried ice cream.    When we refused we started a counter to see what time it would be when we finally left.  We were all done eating at this point (as we didn't get the refills or desserts we wanted) and getting frustrated with the lack of service.  \nJust after 8, we were given our checks. Every one that had another order was wrong in some way.  Those of us who had only ordered the AYCE gave our payment in cash and cards.  Some were very clear that they needed change ($40 for a 30.00 charge which already had a 20% tip included, etc.).  The fixed checks returned at 8:30 and payment was taken.\n\nAt 8:45, a member of our party went and spoke to a person, who explained that he would get the manager to come to our table.  Just after that, we were brought back our tickets to sign and no change.  Those who needed change expressed that and we continued to wait.  At 9:00 we got up and started walking out, those who needed change stood at the cash register to get the change.  This was 3 hours after we had arrived and a full hour after the last person ate any food.  Once we got all the checks properly settled (despite the fact that our tip should not have been 20% as we did not get \"all you can eat\" NOR did we get the extra things we ordered or refills on water, etc), we left.  The one member of our party stayed behind and asked one gentleman why the manager never came by our table and he said that he kept trying to get him to come, but he refused.  That was a huge mistake as customer service is so incredibly important in gaining and keeping regulars.  \n\n\nI am extremely disappointed in this experience.  It was very unorganized from the get-go and not ready for the size of the restaurant.  They are staffed as if they have two tables (on a Saturday night!) and unprepared for the level of support they need for Korean BBQ.  \nThe food itself was decent, but the experience took away from the food.  \n\n\nIf this location of Sa-Ri-One makes it, I might give it another chance, just because I love Korean BBQ, but I do not have high hopes.", "date": "2018-06-17 17:41:04"}, {"_key": "10004506", "_id": "reviews/10004506", "_rev": "_fNzDxSm--F", "review_id": "FYVzSsEVoM8SkKChbSVMrg", "user_id": "Mchd7eLFcpDPwLhVjf7kLQ", "business_id": "GeF4JBbbM93w2_8tzwYOsQ", "stars": 1, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Stopped by today and out of all the Pilots I've visited this by far has the most rude staff.

My husband and I put the furniture the rest of the way together and I noticed that the middle piece of the sectional was sagging in the back. So of course this place of business was closed to call anyone so we said we would call first thing in the morning on Monday. So I called and the gentleman I spoke to told me that there was nothing they were going to do because we shouldn't have signed for the furniture and asked if we purchased the warranty which we did and told us we needed to go through them to get the sectional replaced. I told the gentleman that I was floored that I would receive damaged furniture and have to make a warranty claim already. He said that how do they know that we didn't break the furniture over night I didn't even have the energy to fight with this gentleman. So my husband called the warranty company the next day and started a claim, the lady that was helping him said she was going to get into contact with the furniture store because if they delivered it damaged they needed to bring out a new piece.

We waited and waited for our server to come around to see if it could be closed and nobody came around so we closed the curtain temporarily to avoid the heat. Out of no where, lisa the owner came around the corner and started YELLING at us. After I told her what was going on she said she needed to keep it open so a table that was in our same section could have a view. This table set empty for an hour and if someone was seated, they would of had the same sunburn lol. I can't believe the owner of the restaurant would have this kind of behavior. She wasn't appreciative that we were having our rehearsal dinner there nor even throw us a congratulations! The food is....ok, nothing to bring us back, especially after how I was treated. Hopefully someone else buys them out. She should be ashamed of her rudeness, poor employees! \n\n\nWow, not shocked by this owners rude response! Lisa, I said thank you sarcastically in hopes you'd stop and say, wow, no thank you for having your wedding rehearsal here. Sad the customer would even have to say thank you first, but not shocked. A GOOD owner would of came out and thanked a large group for choosing their restaurant or any size group for that matter, especially for their WEDDING rehearsal dinner. If you would of greeted us or even been more kind when approaching me in the beginning, we could of asked for you to close your curtain instead of relying on your customers to have to make their experience better for themselves. Maybe you should sit and eat in your restaurant once in a while and get the customers perspective. We were already trying to help your poor waitress to fix the tv that we were told would be able to be used to put up pictures for the wedding. Shocker, another thing besides your old raggedy curtain that needs replacing. How about putting some shades in as well so your customers don't get blinded or sunburned.  \nA GOOD owner would of asked how the meal was at the end of the dinner and trust me in saying, we weren't complimenting your restaurant. We were disappointed in lots of things including the food. We could of expressed our concerns, but nope, you never came around. \nLisa, you need to avoid being out in the front honey, please stay in the kitchen or office. I'm going to guess your turnover is pretty high, you're a horrible owner!

I'm not sure how they got high ratings. Also, the staff doesn't seem to understand food either. \nCame in from recommendation that this was a great Asian place and had dim sum. They have a few dim sum dishes, but not a full menu like if you've been to a full dim sum restaurant. That's not the issue.  I ordered the shu mai and it came in traditional group of three. The first one was ok, the center fell apart a little when I bit into it. The second was doughy and I realized the noodle exterior wasn't the right type of noodle. The third I looked at more closely and saw that the noodle wrap was it fully steamed through I could still see the flour markings and the dough pushed and pulled because it was not fully cooked. Real disappointment there. \nAt this point the second dish I ordered came out. I had the pork belly over the mac and cheese at the recommendation of the bartender. He gushed over it. Took the first bit of the pork belly, it was bad. It was chewy and tough like flank steak. I thought maybe, this was just the one piece, tried the next one, just as tough and chewy.  \n\nI put the fork down and was definitely frowning as at that point the bartender came over and asked what was wrong. I told him, I didn't like the dish and he was shocked and asked why. I told him the pork belly was tough and chewy. He replied, \"Well it's pork belly, what do you expect?\".  So here's where I realize the bartender has no clue about food. I tell him pork belly is supposed to be melt in your mouth cooked. And he argued, no it's not. Then said he could get me something else.  I told him no, I have to get back to my meeting. And really, I didn't want to go for a third round of bad food.  The rest of the mac and cheese was fair, curry flavor with mint and pineapple and I felt just one too many flavors. And the noodles were at the mushy level of over cooked.  I had the bartender clear the plates after picking through hoping to find something good or at least eat enough to stretch me to my dinner break when I could go somewhere else. \n\nSo I got the check, they charged me for the mac and cheese which I don't think I should have had to pay for as it was so bad.

He shared w me that Enon Church (which we are visiting) was less than 10 minutes away. \n\nUpon arrival, parking in the Relish lot was easy and we checked in 5 minutes early. To preface, the day of our reservation, the weather was unseasonably hot. We were seated in the room in the front. I understand brunch is set price but was surprised I was handed a cocktail menu but when I asked about sodas and tea, was told they were not included in brunch cost and the restaurant did not have printed non alcoholic drink menu. I was told to ask my waiter. With a reservation of ten that I was picking up tab, it would be nice to know how much tea and soda would cost. \n\nEveryone enjoyed brunch but I felt Relish fell short. We arrived at 1pm est and by 1:20 est the salmon was gone. The sign clearly said \"Trout and Salmon.\" I informed staff salmon was gone and asked for them to put out more and was told they were out. Also they had a waffle station with strawberries and when we arrived at 1pm they were out of whipped cream and they never put any out. For the price of almost $30 per adult I was disappointed. A staff member in my opinion could have put more salmon out and run to store to get more whipped cream. \n\nThe cook at omelette station was clearly irritated he was put on omelette duty when he was the chef that cooked all the food on display for buffet. He shared that with me as I waited for my omelette. \n\nMy final comment is on food safety. The room where the food was for the buffet was very very hot and there was a seafood salad and mayo based pastas on middle buffet table along w fruit and pastries that were out but there was no ice keeping Seafood salad and mayo based pasta salads cool. Also the trout (minus salmon) did not have any ice. For fear of illness we did not eat seafood salad or mayo based pastas. \n\nOverall the restaurant is homey and staff nice. I feel food quality could be better and attention to detail would have made my score higher. For example when we arrived at 1pm the shrimp and grits station did not have any small bowls. We were forced to put on plates both times my niece went back for more. Upon final walk through about 2:15 there were small bowls for shrimp and grits. And the salmon was never replaced and still no whipped cream.\n\nAnd I agree with other reviews. The fried chicken only had odd cuts. No chicken breasts or wings so I did not try it.

I called in the beginning of a December for an early January date. I was informed that the 18 person room I requested booked out 2 months in advance due to the popularity and demand for that size room. The date I originally wanted could not be accommodated. No big deal. I changed my plans around with friends and switched the date to a later January date so that I could have the 18 person room. \n\nUpon our arrival the bouncer that stands outside questioned then confiscated my friends 2 prescription bill bottles, prescribed to her with her name on the bottles. It was Imodium and another medication for IBS. The bouncer stated \"I don't know what's in these bottles; I can't let you take them in.\" She assertively stated that, she would need these medications immediately if she started to have stomach problems or any medical issues and that he would be denying my friend access to take the prescribed medication. The bouncer refused to listen and told her that he would not allow her in unless she gave him her prescriptions. Ugh, ok fine. She handed them over. \n\nNext disaster, the women at the front desk. I checked in for my 18 person private room, and they argued with me that I booked a 12 person room. After exchanging words back and forth, I succumbed to their awful customer service tactics, and went with the smaller room. Luckily, friends of mine had to cancel last minute and we were able to fit in the smaller room. I did ask if they would be willing to accommodate us with anything else, being that they made a mistake. They refused. The woman who came in to \"help\" show us how to use the karaoke machine in the private room was extremely dismissive and rude, leaving us with unanswered questions. We had to spend some time on our own figuring out this machine. By the way, the awful front desk women told us that we were to be out of the room at 12:00 \"AND NOT A MINUTE MORE!\" All around the customer service was TERRIBLE. The workers at Yakatori Boy do not understand the first thing about customer service. They were extremely unprofessional and dismissive. I am giving my rating on Yelp a 1 for customer service.\n\nMy friends made the night SO MUCH FUN! We sang and danced all night. And just when we thought the CUSTOMER SERVICE COULDN'T GET ANY WORSE they came in to give us our bill (of course) while rushing us out of the room after we spent A LOT of money on food and drinks all night. Remember the awful woman at the front when we checked in, \"NOT A MINUTE MORE!\" She wasn't kidding. They were very unorganized.\n\nWe really tried to let go of the awful customer service and make the most out of the night, and I think we were pretty successful. We still had a ton of fun and I would give our individual room a 5 start rating because of my friends and the fun we had, but be weary when booking reservations here.

So i asked them how long will it take this guy named miguel told us that it will be finish by 4-5 hours I also asked them if they want to check the car he said no it's fine so instead of going home we stayed at parkplace and watch movies because we live in south tucson. They called after 3 hours saying that they did not start the car yet because they only have 1 technician. So it might take the whole day so we went home. And then got a call around 5pm saying that they will not finish the car because my car is not matched with their parts.(I even asked them to check the car first and now they're saying that it needs to be check until tomorrow to get a compatible parts) so I decided to pick it up the next day and then I called them because it's noon time but i haven't receive their call. Worst customer service ever! Shout out to miguel.

That's ridiculous all of this inconvenience they are supposed to give a compensation. So to cut the dramas I just paid them additional 120 so i can get my car asap because I need to go to work the next day. I'm expecting that they will finish the car by saturday i drop it last friday so when we called them this miguel told us that they did not finish the job again for the third time. So i pick up the car because i gotta go to work and i was told to bring it back on wednesday so i made an appointment and miguel said that they will put it in the system. So i went back wednesday to drop it but i was told that it will take 2 hours only so me and my friend waited nearby. And they called again saying that their parts are not compatible againnnnn!!!!! So he said he wont be able to finish it. Thursday morning we called and the manager chris answered the phone he said miguel is off what the heck they don't even know that miguel did not inform us about the situation so basically chris did his best to handle it. So by thursday he finished the car and update us every hour so we know whats going on. Shout out to chris I'm giving you a full 5 star.

I did some research, chose Vivace and made reservations for 8:30. The restaurant was still packed when we got there (which is actually a good sign), so we were seated awkwardly in the middle of the room, crammed against other tables and at an angle from each other, which made our conversation awkward, too. I couldn't even cross my legs without totally encroaching on my poor husband's leg space, and didn't even have enough room on the table to place my small clutch.  I would rather have waited for a table than be crammed in so uncomfortably. We felt like an inconvenience in the middle of the hustle and bustle, not like paying guests.\n\nThis isn't Vivace's fault but to add to our discomfort, multiple other tables very obviously stared at us as we came in and throughout our meal. It was so plain and off-putting that my husband almost got up and said something to one older gentlemen who stared at us and even maintained eye contact with my husband until his party left, about halfway into our meal. We got the feeling that it was an old boy's club and that we didn't belong. Again, that was NOT Vivace's fault, but it was incredibly uncomfortable and really put a damper on things. \n\nThe service was fine for a busy Saturday night. Our waitress was polite and personable, but it was clear that she was busy. It took her a bit to make her rounds and get back to us. We did not fault her for that and tipped her well. I wish I could remember your name - thank you for your attentiveness and sweet words. \n\nThe food was \"meh.\" The menu looked great and the pictures online did, too, but both of us were underwhelmed when our food actually came. We ordered the antipasto to start and didn't even touch half of it -- enormous pieces of undercooked red bell peppers, undercooked \"grilled\" asparagus, unseasoned spinach that tasted like it came from a can. The artichokes, goat cheese and olives were good. \n\nI ordered the crab stuffed chicken on the waitress' recommendation. It was hot when served and cooked well, but the sauce was remarkably SWEET. I ate half of it before leaving the rest. She boxed it up for me when we left but I threw it out. Crab has a natural sweetness, of course, but the sauce on the chicken honestly tasted like someone used sugar instead of salt to season it. Maybe it's just a difference in palette but I'm not sure that I would want to come back for another try at Vivace based on that dish alone. My husband ordered the sausage and red pepper pasta. He said it was all right, nothing special. \n\nBecause I left in our reservation notes that it was our anniversary, the waitress brought us a complementary piece of tiramisu with a candle in it - I really appreciated that gesture and credit Vivace with that nice touch.\n\nWe ended up going for drinks elsewhere. It wasn't that we had a bad night, per se, but it wasn't good by a long shot. Perhaps we just came on a bad day, but for supposedly being the number one Italian restaurant in Tucson, we left fairly disappointed. I would have loved to give Vivace more credit.

We were celebrating and wanted some pasta. We made a reservation and were seated promptly. The restaurant itself is cozy and only seats a small handful of tables which makes it good for smaller groups or dates. \n\nI ordered a glass of wine and my boyfriend got an Italian beer that was carbonated? It was bubbly so we both found that interesting. We ordered bruschetta to start and it was okay- the tomatoes were somewhat mushy and cut fairly large and didn't have any balsamic on it which is normally how I eat it. Then the waitress brought out the complementary pasta salad which was awesome and honestly my favorite part of the meal. I would ordered that stuff alone and eat a full bowl. They also brought out our salads, which again were just okay nothing special. We opted out of the complementary bread because we just ate bread with our bruschetta (this is important for later). \n\nThe waitress brought out our entrees a few minutes after we finished our salads. My boyfriend ordered shrimp scampi and I ordered pollo primavera. Both dishes were served hot and smelled great. Our waitress brought our Parmesan and red pepper flakes. We both took a bite of our dishes and decided it needed a little kick. My dish had better flavor than my boyfriends but the broccoli in my dish was extremely over cooked and mushy. The chicken was slightly dry and I didn't eat much of it. My boyfriend's scampi was very bland and tasted mostly of butter and nothing else. He also barely ate any of his shrimp because he said it tasted freezer burned and awful. A few bites in we both decided that we'd like to have the complementary bread with our pasta so we asked our waitress if we could have it with our dinner. She brought it out a few minutes later and both my boyfriend and I took a slice and realized it was still cold in the middle. I know we asked for it at a funny time, but asking for the bread to be warm or at least room temperature seems a little crazy to me. It was surprising and disappointing considering that you are spending $15-$20 a plate for cold bread. At the end of the meal my boyfriend had a few pieces of uneaten shrimp that he didn't want to finish or save. I did take a box home with my leftover pasta. \n\nOur bill ended up being a little over $60 which would've been worth it if our entrees and bruschetta had been better. Probably won't be back due to the food not being worth the price tag. Would rate this a 2.5/5 if that were an option but can't justify 3 stars. \n\nOverall Pros: pasta salad is excellent that they serve before your meal and service is prompt and friendly. \n\nOverall Cons: food honestly- bland, over cooked and freezer burned.", "date": "2018-12-27 16:44:59"}, {"_key": "10007816", "_id": "reviews/10007816", "_rev": "_fNzDzLi--R", "review_id": "3Ow3jYLOC6jIWFBuT1dVQg", "user_id": "SQ0tqjtOoI19N_J3jkWiLQ", "business_id": "ac1AeYqs8Z4_e2X5M3if2A", "stars": 1, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Made a reservation days in advance, still had to wait over 30 minutes.

Two days later, Tom at Caliber informed me on the phone that the bumper he ordered could not support the reverse parking sensors I had on the car. He added that they were not well installed anyway. I told him they were in the right place and functioned well. \n\n- Since I had already waited for so long, I agreed to move on. (In hindsight, I should have backed off then.) The repair was supposed to be completed in 5 days, but the snow storm came (not their fault). One week after the storm (Day 14), there was still no update. So I called them and they simply said the car was not ready; no explanation or apology for being late or for not updating me of the situation. \n\n- Five more days later, they told me my car was ready and I asked for a pickup. They sent two people to drop off my car, which I was grateful for. Just before signing the paper, I noticed that the colors did not match and one side of the bumper was sticking out. I drove my car back to them, and they were not happy about it. \n\n- Without looking at my car, one woman came to tell me that the bumper had different reflection from they other parts. However, the bumper was not the only part they painted; they also painted the side panel, which also had a different color. Without checking the color, Tom came out to dismiss the wrong paint color but agreed to look at the mismatched part. I was about to leave my car there when he said he already sent two workers to drop off my car and that they were about to close (The time was 4:30pm. 5:30 is their close time). \n\n- I insisted on leaving the car there and walking home myself. Tom told me the car would be ready the next day (which is a Wednesday). Not hearing back on Wednesday, I called them again. This time Tom said they were busy and my car would be ready on Thursday. He said one of my original panels was repainted by some bodyshop (not true), as an excuse for the color mismatch. \n\n- On Thursday, Tom told me that he's not happy with the new painting either (guess they made the same mistake) and the car would be repainted. \n\n- On Friday, they called me to offer a car rental. I didn't take it because we didn't need it for the weekend. (Meanwhile, my wife had been taking Uber for her commute to work every work day for two weeks.) \n\n- On Monday, I called back again, only to be told that the car was not ready. So I took the rental offer. \n\n- Another Friday came around. Finally I was told the car was ready. The color was right this time, but the bumper still stuck out a little and none of the backup sensors worked. By then I was exhausted by the process and simply took the car.", "date": "2018-04-02 14:20:42"}, {"_key": "10008042", "_id": "reviews/10008042", "_rev": "_fNzDzMe--C", "review_id": "QFP_Ug9hJyyim2DJcnfvNA", "user_id": "UaedmIjxrMHmMJjJrKLsFA", "business_id": "axBvAzrXqRx2kKadwg87sQ", "stars": 2, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Do not go to this place on Sunday 11-12.

This is the worst hotel in the United States for its price. Here are the highlights:\n\n1. No room service for a week. At one point I was calling the Front Desk, Manager and Guest Services every hour seeking an update on when I could get towels or the room cleaned, nobody answered or returned messages. Not once. So if you aren't willing to wake up at 7 am on vacation to have your room cleaned, they won't come back. I found the cleaning lady in the hallway and was told, \"I get off work in 20 minutes, I'll come back at 8 am tomorrow\" (she never did). \n\n2. Hidden fees. The hotel implemented this orange wristband policy. Even if you had your room key and id, you couldn't enter the hotel if your name wasn't on the original reservation and you had a security wristband. My niece stays 45 minutes away and wanted to come by and visit for an hour, grab coffee and show me her recent paintings. Hotel security told her \"go away or go to jail, NOW.\" I came down and explained she was just stopping by for an hour and they pointed to the Starbucks across the street and told us to go there, unless I wanted to purchase a security wristband for her for $100 cash only.\n\n3. The room. I booked a Suite for the week, it was pathetic. No mini-fridge, small, dirty, and smelled like someone pissed in it if you let it get warm enough. No room changes were permitted and I was told it's \"just how old hotels smell.\" I asked to be relocated to another IHG property in town and was told everything was booked and a refund would not be permitted. \n\n4. Everything was \"out of order.\" The pool, the fitness room, the restaurant. Everything was closed for Mardi Gras, the hotel was nothing more than an overpriced motel 8 bed to sleep on.

The marketplace (coffee stand) in the lobby was staffed by only one person who wasn't happy to be there or friendly-she was stressed out and seemed shocked when I tipped her and thanked her for being there in the morning-it was obvious she was overworked and unhappy. Even the hotel general manager (who'd you'd expect to go over the top with customer service) seemed too arrogant to help guests and rolled his eyes when we asked a question.

So much for Dimmitt wanting my Cadillac and being willing to pay extra for it.  A low ball offer, without explanation, and a cheap attempt to put pressure on me by printing the offer on a fake check to make it look like I could run out and cash said fake check.\n\nDimmitt needs to work on integrity; customer service; and treating people as solid human beings who work for a living and want and deserve a fair deal.

They only had one server besides this host for the first hour were there.  And this was around 7 on a Saturday !.  The host and one server were running around trying to serve like 7-8 tables.  Why they wouldn't hire extra servers on a Saturday is beyond me .  It took ages for a server to come and ask what we would like to drink .  I ordered a beer and waited forever.  I finally had to ask the server to come over to remind him to get my beer.  They don't write down the order so we got wrong type of naan and were missing side dishes.  The people who work there don't smile and are not friendly and are clearly over worked.  This kind of negates the good food for me. This is a simple fix on the part of the owners of this establishment in my opinion.  Hire more servers .  Train them to write down the orders and to be friendly.", "date": "2018-09-19 14:08:24"}, {"_key": "10009600", "_id": "reviews/10009600", "_rev": "_fNzDzZG--J", "review_id": "2EWB9dYS-IxMKo8WtmVdfA", "user_id": "tChRj76DON1i7YqeHRO7-g", "business_id": "OYbHaM1Q5JKFLDwOhRetLA", "stars": 2, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I shop at sprouts 3-4 times per month for my family. That being said- there have been some issues with long wait ( i am only one at deli counter) at deli- too many times they do not have the sides for the take-out chicken special. This most previous experience left us so frustrated - I could not understand how on earth the Manager there is not fired for complete and utter poor attitude and rudeness. All i can say is WOW, this man is not nice! In dairy out of every item on my list- ok it happens. We were in chip/snacks aisle, I noticed a lady moving stuff on shelves and asked her if she ever tried a snack I was choosing- she abrupted replied , I don't eat any sugar and pushed past us. I said oh that wasn't what I was asking, i was just wondering (POOF SHE WAS GONE). I get to health and beauty looking for 3 items, i see an open door with someone at a computer, there are at least 4 other customers in the dept... I push on searching and find one item but it looks 'bad' 'old' discolored' , I search for second item ( i had gotten a sample of a while back and then third item i cannot locate either. i am standing looking like a lost puppy and 2 employees walk right past as I am saying excuse me & ignore me. I go to check out and ask for manager.  A man comes out angry from the get- i attempt to explain about the lady is snacks , his response well shes in grocery so what does that have to do with health and beauty? and he gets angrier as I am trying to show him the 'old' 'discolored item and asking of there is someone to help to which he gets even more mad stating she is training, TRAINING while customers are WAITING- and he makes no mention or apology but basically gets someone and walks away - thsi SOMEONE walks up to me and say ' I AM IN SO MUCH PAIN WHAT IS IT YOU WANT'' , I am takem aback- if someone is ill they should not be complaining to customers right off the get or could be sent home for sick day- didnt understand that- while the manager COULD have just helped best he could. She has no idea what I am talking about even tho I am showing her photos- to which one she says oh must be out & walks away. At thsi point we are totally fed up- we get in line and the cashier is nice at first- but i am mad and tho i am not shouting I AM COMPLAINING abotu the managers actiosn and rudeness- so NOW she gets an attitude towards me and my hubby and says 'sorry you had troubles , and he is .. the stops herself and I guess its all bad' I state its not her fault and  now shes angry and says ' oh well thanks for telling me its not my fault and shakes her head at me. I believe that the manager there whose attitude is just anger, rude and not customer friendly is shedding down onto his employees- NO ONE there was happy. I am about to quit shopping here- I spend hundreds of dollars a month here and this is how I am treated.  Also the lady in pain was like peeking out at us at checkout from behind an end cap - we noticed it and it was very strange- wasn;t she supposed to be at a computer in her so called \"TRAINING\" with literally 40 customers in the store shopping- very busy there at times on Sundays! I did leave with forgetting items I wanted bc I was so frustrated at the attitudes of those employees/manager we encountered on our trip- when ya go to whole foods if you see an employee they alwasy ask if you are finding everything ok- and if they cant help they hunt down someone FOR YOU to help.

We went to our room phone to call the manager on duty, but our phone didn't work. So we had to back down to the lobby to tell someone about what had happened. When we spoke to the manager on duty, he told us to go check and ensure nothing was missing and that he'd meet us in our room in a few minutes. He never showed up. The next day, we arrived back to our room to find things in our suitcase not as we left them and NO towels in our bathroom (for the second time), and our phone still not working. Once again, we complained to the manager on duty, and got an apology and a promise he would \"conduct an investigation\" into what happened. The next day, we asked to speak with the new manager on duty, Nicole. The front desk clerk went into Nicole's office to let her know we needed to speak with her. When the front desk clerk came back out, she said Nicole wanted to know why we wanted to talk to her. We said we had some issues with our room we needed to discuss with her. She went back to Nicole and told her--once she returned, she said Nicole would be right out. Nicole was evidently too busy to come speak with us. We waited in the lobby for more than 15 minutes for her to come out of her office, but had to leave to catch our flight.

We arrived at 4 pm for check in, which is supposed to be at 3pm. Meaning, with a reservation, you should be able to go to your room then. The room was not ready. In fact, it wasn't ready until 8pm.  We had to find ways to entertain a tired 9 year old for four hours. They gave us an upstairs room, despite mentioning disabilities on our reservation, so we had to climb stairs since there is no elevator. Very painful with knee issues, but at this point it would be more hassle to wait for another room. The room was requested non-smoking, but smelled like an ashtray. The casinos smell better. We had to go buy Lysol just to help with the smell. There are cigarette burns in both blankets, stains we aren't sure whether they are makeup or blood on the chair, counter and wall and the tv remote was broken. The bathtub had hair and dirt from the previous occupant, gross! The door does not close properly unless you tug it hard. The windows cannot be opened.

I had to go off my meds because there would days or even a week gap between me running out of my meds and getting the new prescription, it was literally causing me physical pain to go through withdrawal almost every month. I told Molly this. She said the physicals were required for her peace of mind.\n\nWhen I needed a referral to a sleep doctor, Molly's office first sent the request to someone who did not take my insurance. The second person they sent it to, was in the wrong city. The 3rd person they sent it to, was the second person, a second time. They finally sent it to the right person on the 4th try. What should have taken a week, took over 2 months with me hounding them because they cannot be trusted to do their job.\n\nI had pain and instability in my knees and for months and Molly did not give me a referral until a year after my problems started. The first referral was for an XRay and a waste of time because it found nothing. The 2nd referral was for an MRI and it found that I had torn my ACL. Molly had dismissed my pain for over a year and delayed me getting treatment because of her disbelief.\n\nWhen I asked to get some blood work done, I had to wait 2 months. When I got there, Molly told me it was my fault for not pushing her staff harder to get in sooner.\n\nThat same appointment I needed her to do my pap. It clearly states in my folder that I am allergic to Latex. Molly did not have latex. She then proceeded to tell me that if they could not find latex free gloves (KEEP IN MIND THAT I WORK IN HEALTH AND NO ONE HAS LATEX GLOVES! THAT ALLERGY IS SO PREVALENT THAT ALMOST EVERYONE EXCLUSIVELY CARRIES NITRILE GLOVES AND THIS IS A WOMAN DOCTOR WHO SPECIALIZES IN WOMEN'S HEALTH AND SHE DOESN'T HAVE LATEX FREE GLOVES!?!?!) that I can reschedule. It took them about 10 min to find latex free gloves.\n\nI finally told Molly that I would be taking my health elsewhere and she called me \"Murphy's Law\" because everything that could go wrong with me, did. She also proceeded to start baby talking to me. I kid you not. Instead of saying, \"I am sorry you had such a bad experience with me.\" She said (not an exaggeration), \"I'm sawreey wou had a bad twime.\" I, nearly 30, was talked to, like a baby, by a grown medical professional.\n\nI have never been so humiliated and belittled. \n\nI've told everyone I know to not go here, I hope you don't either.", "date": "2018-04-26 06:45:58"}, {"_key": "10011335", "_id": "reviews/10011335", "_rev": "_fNzDzyO--J", "review_id": "v-hJFLwS8Oq-oLm9H8eqpQ", "user_id": "FYTV9Dc5EfIdQHkmEy204g", "business_id": "n5HvZrbrSd20x51HWnYpBg", "stars": 1, "useful": 2, "funny": 2, "cool": 2, "text": "After being approved for a lease on a new Wrangler Jeep at Jerry Ulm Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram in Tampa, FL, on Friday, I received a call Tuesday from Danny Daher atthe financial Department to tell me they need for me to resign all my documents and change our agreement after I signed all the paperwork and was approved.

They gave me mango chutney for me to try in a little container. Everything was neatly packaged in the bag to go. Yes! Those tight sealed containers that I can reuse! Portions didn't seem too right for he chicken curry. They left out the plain naan that's supposed to be included with the curry. Oh no.\n\nChicken biryani doesn't look like how it's supposed to. The chicken is roasted chicken almost like a tandoori which I definitely wanted to avoid. Not the type you use in biryani! I feel like I ordered chicken tandoori with rice.

There customer service is completely non-existent.  I was on a booked flight with a passenger next to me that was so large that he could not fit between the arm rests.  He was consuming my seat along with his own.   I had to sit at a severe angle hanging out into the aisle.  My back is so kinked after 2 1/2 hours like this I'll need to visit a chiropractor.  The stewardess rather than trying to do ANYTHING made a snide comment about it being a tight fit.  She could have at least apologized for the 1/2 of a seat that I paid for.  And she made this snide remark about it being a tight fit right in front of the large passenger.  I really felt kinda sorry for him, I'm not sure if she was trying to shame me or him?    I did not try and discuss this any further while on the plane in fear that any disagreement would get me escorted of the flight by security.  I recently saw this happen on another flight for no reasonable reason other than a customer speaking his mind and the authoritarian airlines just kicking him off rather than addressing the problem.    I understand that airline seats are smaller than ever and people are growing larger.  But when a passenger can't fit between the arm rests and must leave them up to overflow into the adjacent seats a line needs to be drawn.  Not only is it not fair for myself, a paying customer, to forfeit half of his seat to stranger to be smothered.  It is also a safety issue when a person of this size can not navigate in and out of the seat and aisle of the plane in a reasonable timely manner on his own accord.    In addition it left me hanging out into the aisle blocking traffic.  If there had been an accident this man would have trapped another passenger in their seat and appeared to be physically unable to fit through the emergency hatch?  That could cause a life threatening situation.  After the flight was over I went to the counter at the airport and asked what the policy was for oversize people and explained the situation.  Of course they didn't apologize or want to discuss the matter at all, they just gave me a customer service number, lol.  It was 15 minutes to get someone on the phone who admitted this person should have purchased 2 seats and at the same time refused to do absolutely anything to make up for the situation.  Not a dollar, free drink coupons or anything whatsoever.  Just told me he should have bought 2 seats and they were sorry for my uncomfortable ride but they did get me there in my seat so the rest shouldn't matter.  They could not refund, discount or offer anything to reimburse me for purchasing 1 seat and receiving a 1/2 seat with a large man smothering me.  She really acted like it was my fault he didn't buy 2 tickets.  I reminded her they are responsible for ticket sales and customers safety, not me.   Anyhow, I'm never flying this airline again, they literally have zero customer service.

Server didn't seem to know if they had mojitos or not so his response was to open the drink menu and put it in front my my bfs face and say \"this is what we have. I'm gonna go get this table's drink order and your water and I'll be back\" and walks off. They have TONS of mojitos. My bf has to point out the exact one he wanted. Server told us the bar is being slow and the kitchen is as well, so that was already something a customer doesn't want to here considering it's a slow Sunday night. The mojito came after our food, it was watered down so I'm assuming it was either made poorly or sitting on the bar and no one brought it to us. My bf's steak was supposed to be mid rare and came out well done, and my pasta was undercooked. A manager walked by us MULTIPLE times and she never stopped to say a word. She just walked around like a lost puppy. I'm sorry but a manager should be touching every table ESPECIALLY after the entrees arrive to make sure everything came out good.

The server offered us free dessert because of the drink taking so long and said that's what he's been doing all day to other customers. Another thing a customer doesn't want to hear. The manager still never came over to see how everything was even after comping the dessert. She seemed like she didn't care. Our server tried to get her attention a few times and she just walked away. The servers were being very obnoxiously loud by the bar and the bartender was only worried about the girls sitting at the bar and not his other drink orders along with guests that weren't getting greeted in a timely manner. I'm done going to this T.G.I. Friday's. And I'll be sure to let everyone know my experience. I will throw in that the server was sweet and I know he was in the weeds with his other tables because no one was helping and he was also fairly new to serving. It wasn't his fault, there's just no communication here and the management is a joke. I hope he finds a better place to work for.", "date": "2018-06-26 17:40:01"}, {"_key": "10013589", "_id": "reviews/10013589", "_rev": "_fNzD0MC--E", "review_id": "7Ybo-YUneEZPnkB3vlPS9A", "user_id": "fJfvhv8BGICnHpNOmTwU8w", "business_id": "dNKfk53tTRRYW8c8jZWWlQ", "stars": 1, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "We'll see if my opinion changes, but so far I'm very unimpressed.

I explained the incident to him calmly, and he explained that the restaurant passed all health checks and that they have no control over the court yard where the roaches can come from.  Um... did he just try to justify this?  I pressed on and said how is a roach landing on your customer INSIDE the restaurant an expected outcome of dining here? And then he got defensive and said that roaches can fly wherever they want and there isn't anything he can do.  I was furious at that point. Not because a roach landed on me, but because this manager thought my poor dining experience in his restaurant was not his problem.  A few more rounds back and forth, he suggested a 10% discount and free dessert.

You can't hold it, and the coating literally made the bread too soggy to cut.  There was so much sauce on it that it was pretty much inedible because it was so overwhelmingly spicy-- and I'm a person who likes hot HOT stuff.

In fact as we left the club we saw a girl bleeding from her foot, and after asking several staff members for a band aid, they did not provide one. The only thing they could find was a towel and the girl had to walk barefoot and bleeding in freezing temperatures to her Uber. I emailed NOTO for a refund and all I could get was a free ticket to one of their concerts in January. I told them I simply could not risk my safety at the club after this experience. That girl could have been me or any of my friends. They have yet to respond and refund my money. Please do NOT give this club any more of your business, it is NOT the nicest club in the Philadelphia. There are bars that are hole in the walls that have more concern for their customers safety than this club.

Off of initial instinct I thought the salon it self was beautiful and I also liked that it was kid free (I love children but sometimes it's nice just to get away) anyway I thought I would receive a 5 star treatment. I wanted to get a regular mani and pedi, however the guy and this older woman kept trying to persuade me to get a gel mani and pedi instead. After having to assert I only wanted a regular mani and pedi the older woman with the honey blonde hair got an attitude with me. I get to the back where the spa seats are for the pedicure and it was literally $25.00 for a 8 Min pedicure, I'm NOT exaggerating! The lady rushed my pedicure and not once did I get upset or even ask her what her hurry was. Instead I decided to just yelp my experience. As I am writing this review, the lady literally just drops a clump of nail polish on my toe and doesn't even bother to wipe it off she just keeps going over it instead. I asked her if she was okay and she just smiled and kept going. After she rushed my pedicure she just told me to go over there (now this is my first time here I have no idea where she's referring to) I'm not even going to wait until my experience here is over for me to give one star. Professionalism is a must and this older lady clearly lacked it! The water for my manicure was cold af, she also did a poor job doing it then her excuse was because I wasn't getting gel the polish didn't look right on me and she wasn't comfortable doing it. Even though I had paid her already, I told her in the future all she had to say was she didn't want to do my nails. Then she said her excuse was bc my nail length wasn't long. The owner then comes to tell me my business isn't wanted there because of my rating. He then proceeded to say because I \"hate the world\" that isn't good for me. What he meant was \"because I freely wrote my review based off my experience that was not favorable for him, he's mad\".

Hmmm no sign but the on next tot he stairs lol. \n\nAnyway we get downstairs and you can already tell it's one of those old school steak houses with the servers in their tux's, flamb\u00e9 carts and dessert tables on display. I was getting excited and I knew I was getting something flamb\u00e9d. Whatever it was.\n\n\nBefore we ordered, we were served our waters, bread basket, butter and amuse bouche. We started with a seafood platter for two. Which came with 2 halves shelled lobster tails, 4 Cajun shrimps, 2 oysters on the half shell, 4 pieces of seared Cajun ahi tuna all wet! Why they are all laid on cubed ice that is used for your drinks. Not crushed ice that is for seafood. And why the Cajun flavor on anything? I just want seafood no flavor just dipping sauces to choose from. Sure they gave me soy, cocktail sauce, seafood mustard like sauce, but what's worth the sweet pickle, wasabi, pickled ginger because I'm not putting that on the Cajun tuna, that's just not right. Aside from the Cajun seasoning, why was the shrimps over cooked, so rubbery. Don't order this! \n\nSecond course was stage lobster bisque, this was good. Not amazing but good. \n\nMains were shrimp scampi and New York med rare add. On Oscar topping. Here's the problem, the linguini was over cooked, the shrimps once again hard and rubbery which was over cooked. The steak more rare than med rare, the Oscar topping looked like bits of shredded crab leg meat in a weird sauce. It didn't look appetizing. So don't bother with the Oscar topping upgrade. Actually don't bother with the scampi either. \n\nFor dessert yes we kept going, I said I was going to get something flamb\u00e9d! We ordered the banana fosters for two because that's the minimum which is $30 and profiteroles with hot fudge. The desserts were the WINNER!! I would come here just for the desserts! I wanted to try the cherries jubilee but my son like banana fosters uhg. \n\nWould I come here again sure for desserts. Yes they were busy and it seemed like they only really wanted to cater to the loud obnoxious drinking customers and the servers are working the tables for more tips. The other server I witnessed leave mid ordering from customer to say bye to his other customers that have apparently been regulars which was laughable but rude.

I'd much prefer Moe's or Blue Oak... but I get suckered in due to the proximity and their smoker draws me in like a drunken fool chasing neon lights... Anyway: today, dropped by around 7pm... they were already \"out of chicken\".... they only opened at 5pm... yep... ran out of chicken in two hours. All of their beers are $6 or more, except for one cheaper option: dixie for $3.50. They are too cool for bud lights etc... only \"craft and microbrews\"..... We asked cashier how long food was taking today since it always takes forever.... and she said \"I have no idea\".... um... ok... lady... thanks for your guidance.....  As per usual, we took our seats at the picnic table to begin the never ending wait.... drank all my beer... drank most of my water.... heard the jazz band play an entire album.... Finally, 30 minutes later... here comes our food minus the mac n' cheese.... b/c they were out of it... but making more and would bring it out later.... OK... side items are supposed to accompany bbq... not to be eaten in courses.... But we knew in advance we were dealing with a special needs child... and were hungry... and Moes was closed due to a private party (we went there first).... so we trudged through our halfway decent ribs and brisket.... Brisket was reheated on the pit on top of aluminum foil which the brisket stuck to like vinyl flooring... had to scrape it off as much as possible without eating the foil too....  We ate 2/3rds of our meal and wondered if the mac n' cheese was ever going to come.... We saw other tables eating it... so my GF ventured over to the pit master to inquire and sure enough \"OH, I'm sorry, I forgot\".... the pit master doubles as the food runner... dumbest idea ever... let me run some food while burning your brisket to the foil....  Mac n Cheese was OK, Baked beans were only 90% cooked... still a bit crunchy...

I've had the impossible burger in other cities and usually they don't burn it, but here they do so I would definitely not recommend wasting your experience of the impossible burger here.

I'm also I was born in the US so I have no accent so they kept acting like they needed me to translate her very clear English. The service was very uncomfortable and our waitress was clearly not attentive to us at all and very distracted by the fact that my mom is not in her 30s and has an accent which you can understand perfectly. I ordered the impossible burger with white cheddar on it she gave it to me with Swiss it was pretty disgusting and it was burnt. My mom, having less than young teeth, asked for very very soft vegetables and for some reason they gave it to her Al Dante and of course she couldn't eat it. Two people came out to 'handle' this request as though it was unreasonable or unruly. They acted almost as though she was asking for something extraordinary.

We are from Iowa and we had no idea the condition of this place as the reviews and the pictures were very misleading. We checked in July 1st and tried to go up to our floor, only to find out the elevator was not working without personnel. They had a guy working the elevator that appeared to be high as he smelled strongly of weed. To make the situation even more sketchy, the door and ceiling of the elevator were bare, wires and everything exposed, and it did not at all seem safe. When we got to our room, we opened the door only to be hit with a strong scent of cigarette smoke, seeping from the carpet. The room was dim and had minimal furniture, constrasting the pictures online. There was drywall dust (or something unknown) coating the floor boards throughout the entire room and the trim was the extended carpet, which looked super trashy. The furniture was broken and cracked. The room did not seem clean in the slightest and we were hesitant to sit on any of the limited furniture present in the room. When we went down to the lobby we decided to take the stairwell as we would have to call down if we wanted to take the hazardous elevator- the stairwell smelled like urine and felt like we were walking down to our deaths.

She called over another senior colorist, and they both looked at me and tried to say that my hair wasn't taking the color because of styling tools I have been using at home, and the way that I treat my hair at home.

I also ordered a peach cobbler, (because when I asked what they had i was told peach, pecan and blackberry). After the food came the same kid says, \"We don't have peach.\" Ok, I responded, just bring my son a chocolate shake in stead. I get an ok and he leaves. A manager returns and hands me 2.50 and apologized for not having the cobbler. I said, thank you and took what i thought was the difference in price. NOPE. Shake never arrived.

Plus, we knew we were going for the Crawfish Boil Fried Chicken \"basket\" (plate), which comes with 5 pieces, not 6 as shown on the pdf of the menu I'd seen online. Not a great start but still enough for two.\n\nMost of my disappointment has already been described by the other 2 and 3 star reviews. \n\nWe started with a house salad that I don't remember the name of. We had to ask for more dressing on the side since it all seemed to be lumped into one spot, and it was missing the blue cheese, which I guess got lost in translation because we did ask for it on the side. \n\nFor the entree, we weren't expecting boneless, so you only get breasts and thighs. I'm not sure why that's not just specified on the menu. I didn't mind no wings but missed drumsticks. The flavor and texture were fine, and the Crystal mash helped. The 'sides' were a total disappointment. Usually when I see 'mirliton' my eyes light up but everything was just chopped up and mixed together,  including sausage in crumbles. I get that they tried to elevate crawfish boil fixins, but I didn't enjoy that presentation or the flavor. I'm not sure how it's prepared, maybe just a light sautee in crawfish boil seasoning, because the carrots and garlic were barely cooked; crunchy carrots are still edible but not raw garlic. And the one tiny piece of corn was useless, esp when splitting a plate. \n\nOther glitches: 1. The glass that came with my can of beer was very warm, probably right out of the dishwasher. Easy fix, I just poured my ice water into the warm glass and used my water glass for the beer instead. 2. Later when I asked for a Coke, I was told they were out -- as another reviewer mentioned, if that's really the case, just go buy some -- but a few minutes later my friend noticed another table had some. (I think all soft drinks and beers are served in cans, I guess to emphasize the picnic style.) I asked the waiter to double check, unless the other table just happened to get the last two. She did and found one for me, not cold but at least she brought ice. (You can see I have a thing with expecting my drinks to be cold, ha.)\n\nPrices were okay and servers were friendly. None of the glitches were deal breakers and I'm sure they'll work them out over time, but the signature fried chicken dish was disappointing and I'm not tempted by the rest of the menu, so I don't see any reason to go back.", "date": "2018-10-05 03:46:08"}, {"_key": "10018428", "_id": "reviews/10018428", "_rev": "_fNzD0ge--_", "review_id": "-rT93mF7j8urW0av0YGzEw", "user_id": "jWNcyCALPhpRHSdwpBc4_Q", "business_id": "9vUxsNPUoOoSz_LQTEotEQ", "stars": 1, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Their customer service is awful.

For Mother's Day, we arrived for our 5 pm reservation time to find that they overbooked, tried to call us but did not have the correct phone number, so they actually moved our reservation anyway. While waiting, we called many other restaurants but could not get in on this busy day. We were finally seated next to the front door and because of the overcrowding, people would come in the door (cold, rainy day) and stand in the doorway with the door open - no one from Bistro addressed this so I had to constantly get up and shut the door. It took two hours to get some of our entrees - I ordered gnocchi with one meatball but only the gnocchi was served and I was told the meatball is on its way - but my meal was finished before it did so I had them wrap it.  After a long, frustrating 2-1/2 hours, we decided to skip coffee and dessert and just ask for the check. Not a very special day for the two Mon's in our party. But the short rib gnocchi at Bistro was too delicious to resist so we decided to go back for Father's Day for an early 4:30 reservation, hoping Mother's Day was just an anomaly. It was a different but still disappointing experience. The place was relatively empty for Father's Day so long delays were not the issue but lack of preparation and/or poor management was. I was happy to see a favorite on the appetizer menu so I (Dad) ordered the fried oysters. As the rest of the family was being served their appetizers, I was then informed that they did not have oysters - not that big of a deal that they did not have some menu items but the timing could have been better. As dinner moved along, we were constantly brought dishes that belonged to the table next to us while our food was constantly brought to the adjacent table first before being brought to us (not a major issue but certainly more disorganization).  As for the meal itself, the short rib gnocchi was still amazing and everyone else was happy with their meal. Then came dessert time and with pun intended, the \"icing on the cake of disappointment\". I ordered tiramisu - and I will say the tiramisu is one of about 6 desserts that they serve here and it is also amazing. I don't often order dessert and was looking forward to this - until the server came back moments later and informed me that they were out of tiramisu. Now I can envision how it may not be possible to get oysters on some days, or how mistakes by management or staff could result in not telling a customer for 20 minutes that the appetizer he ordered is not available, but not having a signature dessert on a special occasion day can only mean one of two things: either bad management or owners that just don't care because customers will still come. The result is two ruined special occasion days for my family. And one more note, back in about February we went to Bistro for a 7 pm reservation and I ordered my favorite meal. The server told me they were out of it and that they always run out of the short rib gnocchi early on a Saturday night because it is so popular.  You would think they would adjust the quantity of this product to meet customer demand - but i guess the attitude here is that customers will get what we have, not what they want. The short rib gnocchi at Bistro is one of my favorite meals but I will find a new favorite to replace this.", "date": "2018-07-03 15:07:39"}, {"_key": "10018597", "_id": "reviews/10018597", "_rev": "_fNzD0hC--N", "review_id": "0e3x4Whh9tC2NF3LYPN-fg", "user_id": "HqlmnsHmRlMxLFHvKwKt4Q", "business_id": "qeBFhxtnBkkT6HU9Meix0g", "stars": 1, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Was here on Saturday for one of my good friends birthday party.She had made reservation for 12 people  a day before the reservation.when we got there they told us they don't have the reservation and it was lost after the fact that we had made it the day before and also called them to confirm it.

How hard is it to have someone carve more salmon and someone run to store to get more whipped cream for remaining 2 hours of service. Again at $27 bucks per person that is not much to ask. Also room with buffet food was extremely hot. Smoked trout, salmon (which smoked salmon was gone by 1:15 pm) seafood salad and several mayonnaise based pasta salads and a seafood salad were out with no ice to keep cool in the sweltering heat in serving area was an extreme concern for me and my party. We avoided those items due to heat in serving area. For the price this was not acceptable. \nSeveral in the party enjoyed what was safe to eat and available.

I try to remain calm knowing animals have their off days & there is only so much one can do in that situation.

I wonder how many other dogs it's bitten and if their owners have had the pleasure of watching it. I was dismissed. Makes me wonder what's happened in all these years that I don't know about.

We have been really big foodies coming from a huge metropolitan area. However, there are a few things I would like to review about this place that should be considered for improvements. Their food. Oh my gosh. We have been here so many times and have tried so many different things on the menu. But their food is disgusting and overpriced.\nLet's discuss those Pork Belly Sliders... I think they just drench a bottom bun with pork belly fat and then put the saddest excuse for pork belly in the bun.. Then there is avocado which looks like a dog ate tuna and grass all day.. May I suggest if you're going to charge $7 for two sliders that your kitchen delivers quality pulled pork/belly with sliced avocados. The only way to even stomach one of those was the arugula.\nSpeaking of the price, $9 for two loafs of bread is a tad ridiculous as well. Don't get me wrong, it's delicious, but by the time it hits the table, it's lukewarm and the cheese tastes like Velveeta. Just like the Mac N Cheese ($8). Great idea with the crumbs, but please change that cheese. It may be house made but it tastes like Cracker Barrel ($2) or Velveeta ($3)... \n\nThankfully most of your wait staff who have waited on us have all taken care of us.. We have only sent back the pork belly sliders, because, well, that was the final straw for us... There's a few awkward personalities but it will come with time in the industry.\n\nThe biggest issue is the price and food.

Wish it were better run so I could have actually tried what I ordered :(\n\nI had heard wonderful things about this new brunch location in downtown, but had been traveling and out of town a lot this spring / summer and unable to try it. I was SO thrilled to have a free Saturday at home to enjoy my favorites: a nice long walk around downtown, get in a work out, a solid brunch, and errands. \n\nI was so excited (& hungry!!) when I ordered -- I decided to keep it classic and go with \"The OG\" sandwich. It was a beautiful day today, so I asked the young lady who took my order if I could wait and sit at the tables outside on the sidewalk. She said of course, so I took my little table sign to help them deliver my order and sat outside at the corner table -- just outside the door and in clear view of the inside / counter area. \n\nAnd I waited. (Didn't alarm me, because I thought 'hey, it's brunch, it's not fast food'. \n\nAnd waited some more.)\n\nAnd saw people who came in after me leave. So finally, 31 minutes after placing my order, I wandered back in to ask how much longer it might be. I stood around for awhile, as no one seemed interested in asking if I might need some help, despite the look on my face that I can only imaging clearly said \"I'm confused can someone help me?\" \n\nThere was another young lady working the register at that moment, and when I finally got the attention of her and the young lady who had taken my order, I hadn't even gotten through my sentence of asking when my order might be up before they were offering phrases like:\n\n\"Oh, we didn't know where you had went and couldn't find you\" (Ummmm, I was 5 feet outside the door, right in that giant window, holding my table sign, exactly where I told you I was going when I placed my order)\n\n\"Oh, we didn't have any orders up from the kitchen so we thought you already had your food\" (So, wait, now I'm confused. The kitchen never made my food either? That's another problem.... but which is it?? You couldn't find me when you looked, OR you saw me sitting there and assumed I already had food??) \n\nThey offered to get my order in again, but by this time I didn't have any more time to wait before my appt. Then there was the half-hearted offer \"I guess I can give you you money back?\" (even included a shrug) \n\nAt this point I am beyond frustrated, and just want to leave. So I explained that their explanations made no sense and contradicted each other, and walked out. \n\nI genuinely think this is a place with promise based on the menu, and we need more fun options downtown. However, I hate seeing downtown business fail, and it's hard enough to stay open for establishments with GOOD service, that I'd hate to see one go down because of silly avoidable stuff like this. \n\nAnd I was really looking forward to that biscuit too....", "date": "2018-08-18 18:54:40"}, {"_key": "10019573", "_id": "reviews/10019573", "_rev": "_fNzD0kq--J", "review_id": "sLQnyP6RNCUp9bJqxxSIEA", "user_id": "62j1DxG-EOio2vtTrJn05A", "business_id": "0rVp5KwX0knbSEgGHKug2Q", "stars": 2, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "They don't let you pay the bill by splitting it with different credit cards.

Occasional missed pickup but no real problems. My last invoice is now 130% higher than the last one. I called to get an explanation because an increase of nearly $100 for the same service must be a mistake right? Well the first explanation was we increased the rate in the area period so I moved up to a supervisor and am told I can get a \"promotional\" rate which is basically what I was paying now. So he says my account updated and that's that. But then I get an email saying my payment is scheduled at the higher rate, so I call again. The first operator put me on hold to review the notes and then pushed me to someone else (always a good sign). There I was told that number he told you was only for trash so your bill should only be 60% higher instead of 130%. I asked them to review my previous phone calls and was told they would get back to me in a day or so. So in that time I called a different trash company that has a flat rate for the same service cheaper than what I was paying so I signed up with them. I call Republic back to cancel my service which should be simple seems like people cancel their service all the time based on my street. I'm told I have to call back on the 20th of the next month to square away my account, wait a minute so you're telling me to let my bill for the next service period go delinquent and call back to make sure I get my late fee removed and can pay my bill to get my bins picked up which is somehow $48. I will make sure to tell my neighbors to keep an eye on their bills since Republic is a predatory business that relies on people not paying attention to their rate changes.

It looked nothing like the same orders we had seen come out to surrounding tables. We wished for the server who was taking care of customers on the patio.

We were charged for 3 Heatwaves and 1 desert blonde when it was 2 Heatwaves and 2 desert blondes.

However, no scrambled eggs were to be found. My dining mate asked the person who brought out the food for scrambled eggs, and they were never brought out. The rest of the buffet food was eggs benedict, shrimp grits, bacon, sausage, French toast, pancakes, breakfast potatoes (home fries), yogurt, cheesesteak, two kinds of mac and cheese, and soft pretzels.\n\nThe best part of my meal was the orange juice.\n\nWhen we got the check, it turned out that Bootleggers adds in a gratuity for the buffet in the neighborhood of 25 percent, no matter what the size of your party is.\n\nThe people at the table beside us asked for the manager, who defended the lack of eggs by saying people had to ask for them. One of the people cited asking the cook who said that there were no eggs for the day. (Remember my earlier comment about their never coming out when my dining mate inquired?) The manager then mentioned that the people should have complained earlier, saying that they had waited until they had finished eating to complain.

I have two stories to tell about this place. \n\nFirst story: A few friends and I were driving by and decided to walk in to order a pizza, and when we walked in we were all greeted and told that somebody would be with us shortly, so of course, we waited patiently. After about 15 minutes, nobody had bothered to help us, even though everybody working had repeatedly glanced over at us throughout the 15 minutes we had been waiting there. I went to the corner of the counter and looked around the corner, and two employees were standing there on their phones, not doing anything. We waited for a total of 25 minutes at the counter before we were disgusted with the employees and the \"service\" they weren't providing, so we didn't say a word and just left the store. \n\nADVICE: Never walk in to place an order. Put it in online, and at most do carry out.\n\nSecond story: This was only a week or so ago. I ordered a pizza online to be delivered to my work. I'm not sure if you're familiar with the layout of the Domino's app, but when you're placing an order for delivery, it has you select what type of place you're delivering it to (Household, Business, etc.). I selected business, put my business's name, and the business's address... the two things they have you fill out. After being out for delivery for about 25 minutes (it's only 5 minutes away from my work), an employee named David came in and was extremely rude. He walked in, asked if I had ordered the pizza, and said something along the lines of \"Next time you should put your business's name on it so I know where to go, because you made it really hard for me. It was a waste of my time for me to drive around that long just because you didn't bother to put it on the receipt.\" This fired me up, so I proved to him on my email receipt that I had put the name and address. His only comment to me after that was \"Well look at what I have. See, it doesn't say it here.\" and I tried to explain that I don't make the receipts given to him. After everything, I still tipped him... and he just took it and walked out the front doors.", "date": "2018-08-23 19:24:01"}, {"_key": "10024283", "_id": "reviews/10024283", "_rev": "_fNzD03O--M", "review_id": "yeT2VwSh-toEAT_mUWMhEg", "user_id": "mBz5Xh3x5G-T2YbxSzVPrA", "business_id": "Sog1ZG0aJG_8Kiqn9-dH6Q", "stars": 1, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This was a BAD  first choice hotel coming in to the French Quarter Festival from out of state.\n\nWhen walking into the hotel the lady behind the counter said sorry about your luck when reservation was canceled by a third party and hotel staff couldn't care less since there were no available rooms.\n\nThe staff was not helpful at all and didn't offer to call or offer hotel suggestions.

The staff were also very pleasant. However, despite their welcoming demeanor, I had an uneasy feeling about this clinic from the start, as when I initially called to book an appointment, they told me that my brand new insurance was co-insurance, and that I would therefore have to check with my employer as to who the secondary insurer was. This turned out to be completely erroneous, as when I asked my human resources department about it, I confirmed that, as I'd thought, there was only one insurer providing coverage. My employer warned me to beware of this dentist and in fact advised me to go to another. But after having spent close to an hour on the phone trying to set up an appointment for a cleaning, I decided to proceed, and I booked a comprehensive set of X-rays prior to the cleaning, a preventive service that my insurance completely covered. \nI am sorry I did. \nWhen I arrived, I spent 20 minutes filling out a sheaf of paperwork, all of it essentially attesting to my responsibility for payment should my insurance not cover the procedure. I signed the paperwork but stated that, should the dentist recommend any procedure not covered by my insurance, I wanted to be informed of it first. I then had the X-rays.\nThe digital X-ray machine was not working that day, so only bite-wing X-rays could be taken, I was told, and the hygienist had to take two X-rays of one side, as she bungled the first. I asked if, upon my next visit, the remaining X-rays would be covered by my insurance, since they were supposed to have been included in the first visit, and she said yes. However, before I checked out of the office, I was asked to sign yet another paper stating my financial responsibility should my insurer not pay, only this one didn't have anything on it other than a place for my signature. I asked what I was signing and was told that it was standard procedure. The staff's attitude by this point was still pleasant and welcoming but decidedly intent on getting me to sign the form, which I now believe may have been a permission form for the dentist to perform services beyond those covered by my insurance upon my return visit for the cleaning. Since I was running late and because I felt pressured to do so, I reluctantly signed the form, but re-stated my position that I did not want to undergo any services not covered by my insurance. I then asked the hygienist for the third time for the sample of sensitive toothpaste Dr. Davis had recommended during the exam, but she told me that instead of the brand he had mentioned, all they had was an OTC sample -- a brand I could buy at any pharmacy for a dollar. She asked if I instead wanted to buy the brand the doctor had recommended--at $17 a tube -- and when I answered that I did not, she reluctantly handed me the OTC sample. \nThree days later, I received a call from the office staff telling me that my scheduled cleaning would not be covered by my insurance because I needed a so-called \"extended\" cleaning, rather than the basic cleaning I had originally scheduled. When I explained that this is not what I wanted, the staff member, Stephanie, insisted that because Dr. Davis had \"diagnosed\" me as needing this extended procedure (note that I had asked Dr. Davis during the exam to rate the health of my teeth on a scale of one to ten, with ten being the best, and he had told me they rated 8.5), I would have to pay $99 out of pocket. It was only after I strongly objected that she agreed to revisit the matter with Dr. Davis.\nLater that day, I received another call from Stephanie, who, to my astonishment, repeated Dr. Davis's position that I must have the extended cleaning. I then asked if the basic part of the procedure could be covered by my insurance while I picked up the difference. However, Stephanie said that in addition to charging me $99, the office would also be charging my insurance another $95 for the basic service! At this point, I knew that I should have listened to my gut and to my HR office, as it was clear that they were attempting to double bill me. \nIf I weren't so disgusted, I'd have to laugh, as not only was their mercenary focus obvious from the start, but their price, $95 for a basic cleaning (I only paid $75 in California, one of the most expensive markets in the country), was already outrageous. Not only that, but as a first-time patient, you'd think they might have offered me a special deal--maybe that tube of toothpaste (?)--as an incentive. \nLong story short, I told Stephanie that I would not be in for the cleaning or any other service from Dr. Davis, requested that she ensure my insurance not be billed for a comprehensive set of X-rays, had her send those X-rays to me, and filed a grievance with my insurer.", "date": "2018-11-30 04:15:08"}, {"_key": "10024329", "_id": "reviews/10024329", "_rev": "_fNzD03W--M", "review_id": "xOteACW_NclMaq179lT83Q", "user_id": "ks4yzz8mGftxdxBFJyr0og", "business_id": "JGpoGKwiLz85bCsnRzWy5g", "stars": 2, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Started with Oysters that were not cold or cleaned well.

This place uses a few high pressure tipping strategies, seems weird considering its just a juice bar in Delaware. I self served some juices from the refrigerator at the front, when I paid with my card I was prompted on the screen to leave a 10,15,or 20% tip, the cashier kept asking me to make a selection. Granted, there is probably a way to not leave a tip on the screen but you shouldn't even be prompted on self serve items. Additionally, they have a tip container at the register, I get that, makes sense. The weird part is, they keep the container filled with a large amount of cash, obviously indicating that you should leave a large cash tip (because everyone else is right?) I was there first thing in the morning and there was a full container of cash, obviously it's part of the strategy. Wouldn't be as much of an issue if the service wasn't so bad.   \n\n3) The customer service is bad, feels unwelcoming, buying something seems like a hardship. Granted, I've only dealt with the person who's always working the cash register, but from my experience, other reviews, and talking to people I know - this is a major issue.    \n\n4) No nutritional information. There is no nutritional information labels on any of the pre made items. There are calorie numbers on the website only for smoothies and bowls, but still not a full nutritional breakdown. Considering this place is supposed to be \"healthy\" I would like to know the exact information for any of the items I buy. \n\n5) Consistency. There is no consistency at this place. I've bought toast 3 times, one was good, the other two were so bad I threw them out. I've also bought jucies that have been completely different on separate occasions. I had a charcoal lemonade the other day (probably the 4th one I've had so far) and it was so thick with charcoal I had to throw it out. You never know what you're going to get here. Ill include some pictures of the toasts. The owner drank a sample of one of the juices while I was there and said something along the lines of \"this wasn't made right\".\n\n6) Online ordering. The online ordering app doesn't include the pre made juices, so you have to do a separate transition when you get to the store.  The app also gives to 0 information about what you are ordering, no description or anything, you either have to know what you want already, or bounce back and forth from the website to the app. Of the 4 orders I have picked up, only 1 was on time.\n\n7) Price. Considering all the downfalls, the low quality and bad service does not justify the high prices.\n\n\nOverall this wasn't just a bad experience, it's constiant bad service and low quailty. If this place doesn't make some major changes it won't last once people are past the \"excitement\" of a new store. No one wants to spend $6.50 on toast they have to throw out, or $9 on juice they can't drink.", "date": "2018-02-23 17:57:31"}, {"_key": "10024703", "_id": "reviews/10024703", "_rev": "_fNzD04a--H", "review_id": "8r-6_RU-sNa5r5xp96hu2w", "user_id": "DGi-ZnRYBAHs7r-8I0Yrsg", "business_id": "WP9GAuhvmUhm8MAxMqhgrQ", "stars": 2, "useful": 0, "funny": 2, "cool": 0, "text": "Came here once for a dinner with friends.

Based on other reviews and my son's former experiences I'm sure this was an off night for the restaurant but our first visit (6 of us for a birthday dinner) was a disaster.

In fact, our meals took an hour to arrive and when they did my wife's steak was cooked very rare, not the medium she ordered and mine was cold.  I don't mean it wasn't hot, it was COLD!  I've never had that happen before.  Anyway, half of us had to send our meals back to be redone, the other three got to eat while we waited.  Another hour later after continually being told \"just a little longer\", no meals!  They finally told us that there would be no charge and they would give us our food as take out.  We waited another 15 minutes for that.  Two and a half hours in this place and then three of us left without eating!  Crazy.  Our waiter was pretty embarrassed and apologetic but I didn't get the impression that the managers had any control over things.  While we waited we saw managers speaking with patrons at other tables; I can only guess dealing with similar issues.

We walk in and no one was inside. She then walks in and says \"what can I do for you we close in about an hour\" it was 6:30. It says they close at 8 but we didn't question her. We told her we wanted to do some tastings and get a couple bottles. \nShe sits us outside and said \"got your Groupon?\" We responded \"no? Should we?\" From my knowledge Groupon isn't exactly advertised from a business. So anyway we of course get the Groupon. It included 2 bottles of wine and the cheese spread and whatever else. So we decided on that. Now on to the tastings. \nShe clearly knew only a small amount of Information about the wine we were tasting. But we were just trying to have a good time. She blabbed and blabbed forever. Made us laugh. So that was done. We decided we wanted to get a bottle of the '50 shades, for sure and then maybe another semi sweet. She then tells us we had to pick one up at another date but just pay for it today? Unbelievably confusing. But she thought we wanted 2 of the 50 shades and she only had one. Whatever, simple communication. \nShe takes my card and tells us to use the Groupon later? It happened so fast we we're so confused. We just bought the Groupon. She gives us a bag of the 2 bottles unopened and goes back Inside? Oh and she took our crackers. So I went in and said we need to void this because we just bought the Groupon and we want to use this. \nShe she called someone and did the void, then we assume she's knew? She she did the void. Done. \nShe goes back inside. Well our Groupon included snacks.....? I physically had to go find a wine opener, ask her about glasses.

I'm not sure where management was last night, but clearly these employees were not afraid to be as rude and annoying as possible.

Skip to last bullet for TLDR.\n\n- Came for a birthday dinner with a party of 12 and a reservation made two weeks prior. Received a call one day before saying that their policy is a maximum capacity of 6 per table, and with how close we were to the date, we settled for two parties of 6 awkwardly sitting at separate tables.\n- Arrived at 6:30p with orders taken promptly at 6:45p. One party received their food at 7:30p and ate their full meals entirely, while the other had to wait another 30 minutes. Overall, waited nearly 1.5 hours.\n- Went up to ask waitress to see how much longer it would take, and we were told it was being plated and it shouldn't be much longer. Waited a bit longer. 4 of us at the table received our food, 2 of us waited a little more.\n- It was frustrating because we had already been asked to be seated separately as a party, and then we basically were served as separate parties and ate at different times.\n- Not big on complaining at establishments, but we thought we would do it this time to express to the management team our frustration. When we spoke to the manager, she had apologized but went into all of the intricacies of why it took as long as it did: they only had one chef, our bills were provided to the chef separately - the chef makes orders by the bills and another table had everyone order pasta and the bill had been slipped in between our two tables' bills, and that we didn't get our food cold, so they had no reason to do anything more for us. She told us three times that they weren't a fast food restaurant and that, unexpectedly, everyone in the restaurant had ordered pasta and that was why it took so long. There was nothing she could do for us but offer dessert on the house. She also wanted us to know that they had a small selection of pasta on the menu to avoid these situations, and yet, here we were in the situation. When asked if she could provide any sort of compensation for the experience, she said that we got our pasta hot so there was no reason for them to, albeit 1.5 hours later. She said she would call the owner and talk to him, but she said he was going to say the exact say thing she had said and wasn't going to offer anything. She told us twice.\n- Not sure if she thought we were 17 or something, but definitely talked down to us. She really wanted us to know that they weren't a fast food restaurant. Felt like I was being lectured by a stranger.\n- TLDR: If you decide to come here for dinner, check in with the other tables in the restaurant to make sure that they aren't ordering pasta, or else you'll probably wait 1.5 hours. Bring up the wait time with the manager if you feel like being shit on and are a sadomasochistic and enjoy it when the chef/owner/husband of the manager comes out to glare at you for the rest of your stay there.

Sunday evening 10/28/18; a friend and I decided to dine here for the evening, we always sit at the bar. \nUpon arrival we seated ourselves and it takes the bartender some time to ask us anything. It was not a busy night but she was so engulfed in a conversation with people across the bar that she took a long time to say anything to us. Once I gave her our drink choices, she took a long time to bring the drinks over. She decided it was more important to help the waiter \"fish\" something out of a glass of wine with a straw for 10 mins (after fishing this lint/hair/or what ever) they put the glasses of wine on a serving dish to take to a customer that was seated in the dining room.

So now that we have our drinks and she has told us about the specials... we are ready to order. I ordered filet mignon and my date ordered the salmon. So the food is beautifully presented but my steak had a \"gorgonzola dolce\" melted on it.. This gorgonzola cheese was very pungent and strong! So strong, you needed to eat something after for a while to get the taste out your mouth. I tasted it and did not like it. My date said his salmon was under cooked also. So the bartender took the food and said \" i will have them make you a steak without the cheese\". So now the food comes back in 7 mins... We were all shocked that the food was done so quickly!! Even the bartender was shocked!! So i tasted my potatoes and veggies on the plate. Guess what, they gave me the same veggies, potatoes and steak but on a new plate!!! The only difference is they put a sauce over it to hide the pungent cheese taste...  I still tasted the very \"strong cheese\" on the food and now I'm pissed. So what they did was take my steak to the back..... wiped it off... hoping they got this melted nasty strong cheese flavor off.... and gave it back!!! I still saw the knife mark where i cut it previously!!! I could have wiped it myself if i had known that was what they were gonna do... (which i attempted before giving it back) So now I give it back and I'm super pissed and fuming about this \"fast one\" that they attempted to pull... The manager comes over again and says \"I will have them make you a brand new steak!! They took this steak and tried to just get the cheese off but clearly that didn't work!!\" Who says that!!! I looked at this man as if he had two heads at this point.. He attempted to have me order something but i was so pissed i wanted nothing to do with this place now and he knows it. What shocked me even more was the fact that he never attempted to remedy the situation. He could have said \"oh have another glass of wine on us\" or \" your next round is on us for the inconvenience\"... NOPE nothing... instead he said \"we will take this steak off the bill..

When we arrived on a Friday night, around 8:30pm, there was a wait for a table, but that is usually a good sign so it didn't bother me. I was excited to try their food.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe were seated at a booth under the speaker system. The music was confusing to say the least. At first they were playing hardcore opera, then it changed to Christmas songs. It was March, so I didn't understand why they were playing Jingle Bells. We asked the waiter and he said he also had no idea. Anyway, I tried to zone the music out and ordered a bottle of wine. The waiter took a long time to come and take care of us. He didn't explain the menu, or give us his name, or check on us throughout the dinner. I felt we were forgotten most of time because everything took a really long time to come to the table, even the bottles of red wine ($38 each) we ordered.\u00a0\n\nWe started off with some appetizers: The flash fried brussel sprouts ($8) with ponzu sauce and crispy onions straws. Unfortunately, the sprouts were falling apart and swimming in what appeared to be a dark broth. They were very salty and overall not appealing.\u00a0 They were also served without the onion straws, and the server failed to notice. The baked goat cheese platter ($9) served with caramelized onions and crostini toasts was very simple and lacked presentation, but at least it was served warm.\u00a0\n\nFor dinner, we ordered a couple of dishes from the daily specials and regular menu.\u00a0 Let me start with the beef Wellington ($45), which I was very excited to try. While the meat temperature was perfect, it lacked flavor. The foie gras between the steak and the pastry dough was very dry and flaky, and so I had a hard time enjoying it. The Chilean sea bass ($40) served with leeks and some baby shrimps was a generous portion of fish, but the texture was a bit gooey. I did not enjoy this dish either. The lobster crusted grouper ($30) with hollandaise was average. The tiny pieces of lobster were coated in what seemed like breadcrumbs, which was not expected. The fish had a good flavor but the crust was not as good. I was not feeling the thick creamy sauce.\u00a0\n\nOverall, the service was less than average and the food was less than enjoyable. An expensive tab for unpleasant food.\u00a0 I came with high hopes of a great dinner and I was deeply disappointed that I did not have the same experience as other Yelpers did. Unfortunately on this night, they were completely off with the food, the ambiance, and the service.\u00a0 And I wouldn't blame it on the place being busy, because by the time we left the place was almost empty.", "date": "2018-05-04 14:11:03"}, {"_key": "10025622", "_id": "reviews/10025622", "_rev": "_fNzD07u--C", "review_id": "XXFARJUTSMaoyW8HO9lljg", "user_id": "P22E6cqI6adW8yJN0XTavQ", "business_id": "sq3BcLyY4_jZf-zkO2itDA", "stars": 1, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This doesn't even taste like how taco bus is supposed to taste, don't waste your time going here, parking sucks, you'll have 20 people ask you for money along the walk, the employees are rude, the food fucking sucks, So just go to the one on Hillsborough because that's what taco bus really is.

It took our waiter about 10 min to come to our table to greet us, and overall the service was mediocre.  Our food was also mediocre. The Brussels were very disappointing. Tough and had a strong vinegar taste.  The ones we make at home are much better. The pork chop was tender and delicious but the smokiness of the cabbage that accompanied it was overpowering and off putting. The steak was hugely disappointing. We were told the cut was filet but no way!  It was tough and very under seasoned... and there was no salt on the table.

He touched the bug and it started crawling very fast. He then picked it up and killed it with his hand. Even after seeing the bug himself,  Sid refused to give me back my money. He began to insinuate that we planted the bug because we knew exactly where it was (which was where we saw it duh). I am very disappointed in this hotel. I am still waiting to hear back from Best Western headquarters on this matter. I am still in shock as to how we were treated and how they are not taking this matter serious enough.  I am now traumatized and will have my home inspected to make sure I did not bring any home. If I don't hear from anyone  and receive my refund soon, I will make this into a legal matter.
