Scratch that, probably the best egg tarts in Philly. I keep trying to catch them straight out of the oven, but I think you probably have to ask them for that or something, because the last time I watched them bring out a fresh batch of egg tarts, and ordered it, it was still cold. Definitely still, good, I just want to try them right when they come out of the oven. I wish I knew when they baked those darn egg tarts. I'll have to ask them next time. Anyways, unlike most of the places in Chinatown, they use a flaky crust for their egg tarts. Pair that with the sweet, creamy baked egg custard filling, and it is a match made in heaven haha. Flaky crusts are the way to go for egg tarts. \n\nTheir other buns and savory pastries are standard; taste the same to me anywhere I get them. My sister favors their butter bread though, which is very good, and can act as dinner rolls. The drinks here are ok, nothing special. They serve the standard milk tea, lemon tea, and they also have bubble tea, but I've never gotten that here. They have a few small tables for you to sit on, and a refrigerator with soda and canned/boxed drinks right by the door so you can grab and go(no five finger discount!!! Remember to pay). I've also had the lemon cake before, which wasn't bad, but sometimes I do stray from the cakes, as they don't always look fresh.\n\nI don't think I've ever seen young people working here; it's usually 1 or 2 middle aged ladies behind the counter. They're not mean, but they're not overly friendly either. They just do their job, that's all it is. No extra smiles or small chat. And usually, there will be one or two middle aged/old men sitting toward the back reading the newspaper, making it seem more like the cafes in HK, where old people will hang out in cafes just to drink a cup of tea and pass the hours by. \n\nAll in all, stop by here for an egg tarts, if nothing else.

I'd originally planned to go to one of the newer spots but I've been here many times and knew they wouldn't disappoint me. I wish the rest of the city was like Chinatown that place is always jumping it feels like NYC. \n\nService 4.5/5\nThe counter lady was all business but the two people in front of me were elderly and I thought she could have been a little gentler with their cake box. I'd a feeling there was an actual cake inside and the man commented to me that \"this is a peaceful place,\" right before she slammed his cake box on the counter. Now he epitomized customer loyalty but I could see (though he didn't say it) he didn't feel appreciated by the counter lady. A loyal customer is special and should be treated accordingly. \n\nAmbiance 3/5\nI've been here before it's not peaceful. But I enjoyed the people watching. There are usually senior citizens sitting together watching the news in Chinese with a cup of coffee or tea it's lovely to see them. And even better b/c the scent of coffee wafting through the cafe/bakery smelled divine. I didn't order it though b/c I'm a habitual insomniac so no caffeine for me after 2pm.\n\nFood\nEgg tart 3/5\nThough it was delicious it was way too sweet for me and i love sweets. The tart crust was perfect but the egg custard was too sweet. I won't order it again although it was very creamy and otherwise cooked perfectly.\n\nRainbow cake 5/5\nNot too sweet - it was perfect and just the right amount of frosting. The sponge cake was moist and had the right texture. I basically have the pallet of a little kid so if i see rainbow sprinkles i say yes please.\n\nMy check came to $2 so I highly recommend you make a visit and try different items b/c at those prices you can afford to take some risks !", "date": "2018-11-18 23:11:45"}, {"_key": "5419226", "_id": "reviews/5419226", "_rev": "_fNzG__2--X", "review_id": "I8k0__Bp6EYuu73hxZ0kYg", "user_id": "UuVWbpQu76pJOFc1SQNk6A", "business_id": "MTSW4McQd7CbVtyjqoe9mw", "stars": 2, "useful": 2, "funny": 2, "cool": 1, "text": "The lady on the counter looked like she did not want to do business at all, her face was very unpleasant.

I frequent laban's favorites, bubblefish being one of them and the last visit left something to be desired. The fork in the road left me with two options, Royal Izakaya or Tuna Bar, and boy am I glad I chose the latter.\n\nThe ambiance is on point, and the service is friendly and welcoming. The menu is curated beautifully, from my understanding they narrowed it down quite a bit from the other location. This means everything on the menu is guaranteed to be fantastic and FRESH.\n\nWe started with the steamed chicken dumplings which were light and steamed to perfection. The ginger salad followed with slices of avocado and wonderfully balanced ginger dressing that wasn't too sweet. And they even do spring mix, which was great considering romaine isn't the best these days. \n\nFor our sushi selections we went with the classic dragon roll, the east roll, the j & j roll, and 4 pieces of the tasmanian salmon, which is a fattier cut of wild caught alaskan salmon. The fish absolutely melted in your mouth and highlighted the night beautifully. The dragon roll was crafted wonderfully and the rice on every selection seemed to highlight the delicate subtleties of genuinely fresh fish. The wasabi was even a notch above. I don't know what else I can say besides try it for yourself. The preparation of everything was so wonderfully thought out and you can tell they care about what they do here.

So, we went over to check it out. With the wall facing the street being all windows, the inside was flooded with natural light.

Very clean decor, I am glad they didn't put up any kind of cheap or fake Asian \"artworks\" on the wall.\n\nWe ordered an appetizer and side dish to go with our sushi rolls. We chose Creamy Rock Shrimp, Lobster Fried Rice, Sindy Roll and Old City Roll. All in all, they were all very tasty, high quality and we enjoyed them very much. Yes, everything was perfect until we ordered some desserts... \n\nSince they didn't have a dessert menu, we ordered Tree Cake and Green Tea Cheesecake based on the description of the dessert that our waitress gave us. \n\nThis so-called Tree Cake...I call it \"rip-off\" cake. Our waitress described it as a cake made with almond, egg and butter. When it came out, I was shocked what it really was... If you are familiar with a common and popular sweets in Japan, one of them is called Baumkuchen which is actually a German layered cake. They can be purchased from most bakeries and stores, and not so pricey unless you go to some fancy boutique to get it. The cake we were presented with, in my opinion, was store-bought, and sliced as thinly as possible. For $10, you can buy an entire cake!!! Very disappointing... And on top of that, it was dry (with these thin slices being cut off from the cake, I wonder how long it has been since the cake was first purchased?). And if that is not enough, we were given spoons to eat this...why? I don't know...\n\nOur waitress was very friendly and polite, and we were well taken care of. Everything we had, other than the Tree Cake was great. High quality and tasty, a bit on pricey side, but that comes with the quality. I wish if we made a different choice with the dessert.

I am always on the hunt for good sushi in philly and almost every place I've been to left something to be desired.Tuna bar served fresh sushi and well seasoned soba noodles that not only satisfied but had my friends raving about their next return. You know it's a good meal when we are talking about our next visit!\nSince we had a 5pm reservation we were able to partake in their happy hour specials which included drinks and $5-$7 sushi rolls. It was a great deal considering the quality and ambience. For the sushi we went with the classics spicy tuna, spicy salmon and the salmon avocados. They were able to accommodate for my friend's wheat allergy but giving her gluten free soy sauce. The waiter was very patient and thorough with making sure my friend did not encounter any wheat products. Besides our sushi, my other friend got the chicken dumplings and the avocado ginger salad, which were both excellent. We also happened to come on a particularly beautiful day so the doors were open and they had a photographer take pictures of their new menu items. One of which is this stunning cocktail called 1912 which is inspired by the cherry blossoms in DC. The bartender sprinkled hibiscus dust on top and garnished it with beautiful flowers. It was light and refreshing and not too sweet. It also doesn't hurt that it is a beautiful work of art!\nLastly we had our sweet ending with the dark chocolate sesame ice cream.

I called, no answer. So I messaged them via Facebook.

As soon as we sat down and looked at the menu we realized almost half of it included shrimp aka SHELLFISH (see V-day menu pic). Now maybe they were unaware that shrimp is shellfish?

Just your average dumpling. Nothing too unique about it, but they were tasty nonetheless.\n\nWagyu Beef Spring rolls: onion, ginger, cabbage, scallions, and mustard sauce. The mustard sauce was a star of this dish.  I could honestly drink it. It went really well with the spring rolls but made the dumplings much better. We honestly wanted to order like 6 more servings of these. SO GOOD.\n\nEel Avocado Roll A perfect balance of eel to avocado. It had a teriyaki-ish sauce on top.\n\nSpicy Tuna Roll  Just your normal spicy tuna roll, but it's my go-to. I definitely didn't need to eat any more sushi at this point in the meal, but I love trying them wherever I go. \n\nDragon Roll: crab, avocado, cucumber, topped with fried eel and avocados. \n\nDynamite White Tuna Roll: spicy walu, crunch, and shishitos.\n\nThey weren't kidding about the spice of this roll. The spice was at a good level between the spicy sauce and shishitos and the tuna seemed to balance it all out. Would definitely order this again.\n\n KJ Roll: seared scallops, Kani, cucumber, avocado, and wasabi aioli\n\nAlso delicious. Just the right about of heat and had a great amount of seafood in the roll\n\nRolls that weren't our favorite: \n\nBroad Street Roll: spicy salmon, avocado, crunch, soy paper, topped with king salmon and spicy salmon. No rice. \n\nThis was the roll that our server recommended. although it was good, it was probably my least favorite roll that we ordered. I'm not sure if I ever had a roll without rice, but it felt like it was missing something texturally. If you like salmon, you should order it, but it was just meh to me.\n\nOverall, we liked the Tuna Bar. The food and service were good, but the atmosphere was a bit loud for our liking. I think I saw that they have happy hour deals, but I know we definitely missed it by going on a Saturday night. I think the prices were reasonable for an upscale sushi joint.

We opted not to bring a cake because they have a $45 cake fee. \n\nThe drinks here were strong and I quite enjoyed them. I tried the Winston's heat, which was very much cucumber-y and refreshing, the NORI-Grets, which basically tasted like a margarita, and the Yuzu sour, which was a bit too sour for me. \n\nWe ordered a bunch of dishes for the table, which came to around $400 with tip and tax. \n\nThings I'd recommend:\n1. UNI: the uni here was surprisingly fresh (compared to a lot of their other fish). While MP was $12 a piece, I'd say it was pretty worth it. Not sure if the UNI is always this fresh, but we definitely came on a good day. \n\n2. Vegetable fried rice: I'm sure all the fried rices here are good (they have 3 different choices in total, a sausage one, a crab wasabi one, and a veggie one): We opted for the veggie rice and it was delicious - Super simple, but full of flavor. A bit greasy, but definitely a delicious and straightforward dish. \n\n3. Grandma's Wonton soup: I didn't try this, but this was a dish ordered for my grandmother (we thought a grandma soup would be good for a grandma lol). She really enjoyed this! These are Fuzhou style wontons so they're super small, but she ate this entire dish and that doesn't happen often - so they must've been authentic and delicious! \n\nThings I thought that were just OKAY: \n1. The rolls: We ordered the eel avocado, California, avocado, and peanut avocado roll (lots of avocado lol). While they were pretty solid (was personally not a big fan of the peanut avocado roll), I'd say it really wasn't anything special. I guess they presented it in an aesthetic way, but definitely not any better than the regular $5 lunch special rolls at a random sushi joint. If you're a fan of sushi rolls, their rolls are definitely a safe option to order but again, they won't wow you. \n\n2. Oysters: My mom actually really enjoyed the oysters, so this might be a preference thing. They weren't bad by any means but I definitely didn't like that the oysters were pre-seasoned and flavored. Whenever places do that it naturally makes me question the oyster freshness. We ordered 12 oysters in total, 6 East coast and 6 west coast. The oysters were around $3, which I thought was pretty pricey - especially because dollar oysters are pretty easy to find. I pay for $3 in NYC when I've missed happy hour and am REALLLLLLLY craving oysters, otherwise I can't really justify the price - especially in Philadelphia and for the size/taste of these oysters. Again, not bad but not worth it in my book. \n\n3. Seaweed salad: We ordered this for my grandmother who's pretty picky with what she eats. It tasted like standard seaweed salad. Not really sure what else to say about this one. \n\nThings I'd skip: \n1. Tuna tartare: My cousin mentioned this was a dish that was pretty popular here so we decided to try it. Tuna didn't taste very fresh. \n\n2. Big tuna sashimi: Tuna, again, didn't taste fresh. I'm confused why this place is called tuna bar when their tuna doesn't seem...great. Our waiter described this as an \"omakase\" but we chose to order and share with the table. The best part of this plate was the tuna rolls. The sashimi slices were fishy and honestly the color of the fatty tuna made me feel, for lack of better words, A BIT FISHY, about this place. \n\nOVERALL, this place is a fun time and has a great atmosphere. Their fish and tuna truly is...whatever, but I'd still recommend this spot for a nice date or hangout with friends / family.", "date": "2021-09-12 13:29:58"}, {"_key": "5195712", "_id": "reviews/5195712", "_rev": "_fNzF1Jq--J", "review_id": "v8GdbEuPf2XMKekHKtWLIA", "user_id": "UofNOOpeAXgCFnMlQMXpMg", "business_id": "MUTTqe8uqyMdBl186RmNeA", "stars": 3, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This was a bit underwhelming.

I believe I tasted a very slight hint of vinegar in the broth.  I'm not exactly sure what it is, but whatever it is, it provides a modern flare to the broth, to go along with the delicate and very tasty deconstructed wontons.  The dough used for the wontons is extremely light, and the sausage is more significant with great flavor.  My second course, the Wok Kampachi Ceviche, was not only as delicious as before, but this time the kampachi was a more generous serving than my earlier experience.  \n\nRather than a number of smaller dishes, tonight for my third course, I decided to order a larger entree.  The Salmon Shokiyaki proved to be just the right choice.  I like my cooked salmon to have a warm pink center, yet a slight crispness on the outside.  This dish was perfectly done with a warm pink center, slightly crisp, along with a glaze on it that I think may have been miso based.

Yum. \n \nDrinks and Cocktails: The best part about going to an amazing restaurant for food is having an amazing alcohol and drink selection to complement the meal.

It's a beautiful restaurant, the food and service was great and their specials were amazing. The ambience is perfect for a date night. We ordered the brussel sprouts which were nicely charred and doused in sweet and salty sauce, and the tuna tartare which isn't a super unique dish but it was done very well and it came with rice crackers to serve as a vehicle for the tuna. We also went with some happy hour rolls of spicy tuna, salmon avocado which were $5 each then a peanut avocado roll as well for $6. The peanut avocado roll is so simple and so good. I actually ordered a second one I liked it so much. I've had spicy tuna at more places than you can count, and this is exactly what you want when ordering spicy tuna. You can tell a restaurant knows what it's doing by the rice. Tuna bar knows what it's doing. Again, these aren't super original, but just done very well and a bit more refined than your typical fusion restaurant. We finished the meal with some Mochi for dessert that had 3 flavors and they were all delicious.\n\nSince there's a lack of happy hour info on Yelp, here's the down low on their happy hour. This could be the best happy hour deal in the whole city. It's Mon-Fri from 4:30-7. Drink options are: one sake (mine was only $4 and poured traditionally overflowing into a masu box), one house red and one house white wine for $7. We went with the white and it was pretty good. You have the options of 3 beers, Kirin, Kirin Lite, and Orion for $5, $4, $4 respectively. Then there's one rotating house cocktail for $7. The night we went, it was a gin martini made with craft vermouth which is a ridiculous deal for just $7. Judging the way they handled the sake alone I'm sure their bar program is excellent. I will return to confirm this.\n\nHappy hour food: 3 rolls for $5 each, Spicy Tuna, Spicy Salmon, and Salmon Avocado. There's also chicken and shrimp dumplings for $7, edamame for $4 and shrimp and oysters for $2 a piece. \n\nBonus tip: (as far as I know) every Tuesday is Tuna Tuesday. Spicy tuna rolls are $6 all day and tuna tartare is $7. Every Thursday is Toro Thursday. Negitoro rolls are $7 all day. \n\nJust come try this place for a happy hour, you'll never want to leave.", "date": "2018-12-05 15:08:42"}, {"_key": "5253081", "_id": "reviews/5253081", "_rev": "_fNzF3JC--Q", "review_id": "D6IzBA1pNwCvipd2a8aaIw", "user_id": "5zgNmtVU5Xg1zBbxutQCjw", "business_id": "MUTTqe8uqyMdBl186RmNeA", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Amazing sushi in a cool space.

I must have been to Tuna Bar at least 10 times last year.  However my last experience was the most atrocious experience I have ever had.  I understand that it was the first opening day and some hiccups are to be expected, but Friday is quite beyond.  First we arrived at our reservation time of 7:30.  Once we arrived we were told by the very disheveled matradee that they were running about 30 minutes late.  No issue so we took a walk around the block.  We arrived back at 8 and were told we were the 2nd table to be seated after 1 couple and they were cleaning 2 tables at that moment.  We sat on the bench at which point I watched him seat 2 couples.  Then another customer who showed up later than us went and said something and he sat them at a 4 top.  At that point I went back up and he looked at his computer and couldn't find my name. He eventually found it and looked confused.  He said I'll be the next couple and said here's a $25 gift card.  It was only $15 when I opened at home.  We waited another 15 minutes at which point a waiter started going to everyone including us to tell us they were out of food.  \n\nThere were multiple chances to tell us they would be out.  Instead we waited and waited, watched other people be seated when we were due to be next.  I rather write to you directly then putting my review on social sites as I think you should know about my full experience.

The fluke was so gooood and went really well with the capers, blood orange, and radish pieces! I couldn't get enough! A must ORDER!! \n\nRock shrimp: this was good as well!! I liked it because it wasn't coveredddd in sauce or heavily fried. It was the perfect balance of sauce and batter  - there was radish pieces as well - which I loved! Gave it a nice, refreshing crunch to your bite. \n\nLobster rice - this was just your usual fried rice ... with lobster and mushrooms.

This is a place that suits many occasions, first dates, get together with friends, lunch with a coworker, etc. I would say definitely more of an intimate setting, I came here with Megan F. for a lunch during a work break! Such great vibes. Love the bar area and full length windows, just adds to the ambience! \n\nWe tried their steamed chicken and shrimp dumplings as an appetizer and for rolls we split the J&J roll, peppered tuna roll, and the east roll. The east roll is just your standard salmon sushi roll, nothing too crazy.  The J&J is a great roll for people trying to transition into the sushi eating world of actual raw fish! Loved the seared tuna on the outside. Hands down, our favorite was the peppered tuna roll! I'm a spicy tuna roll enthusiast and I decided to switch it up with this roll.

It said it had avocado so I assumed they were just trying to be different by calling it a ginger salad instead of an avocado salad. Most sushi restaurants that I go to have an avocado salad on the menu with ginger dressing and it has at least a half of an avocado on top. This salad came out almost immediately after I ordered it and it was super cold which makes me feel like it's one of those restaurants that pre-makes salads and keeps them in a fridge or cooler. The avocado was so sparse I barely even knew it was in there. Not what I'm used to! To be fair, I assumed it was the avocado salad that I get at other sushi restaurants. \n\nWe split the lobster fried rice because so many people raves about it in the reviews. It was decent.

I don't remember what the other one was even called or what was in either of them. What's not forgettable is the price point of these unforgettable rolls. Their special rolls cost $15 to $21 per roll. ($21? Seriously?) They were falling apart as we tried to pick them up with the chopsticks. The wasabi was more mild than I'm used to. \n\nThe bathrooms are individual rooms for one person at a time. There was different music playing in the bathroom and it felt like a dance party.

Was able to sit at the bar due to a wait for tables but understandable. The bar is made out of pieces of wood that kinda scream Fixer Upper is on the DVR. The vibe of the place was urban and perfect for its location. For apps we ordered the Roasted Brussel Sprouts. Tuna Crudo, Miso Soup and the Pork Gyoza. \n\nThe Miso was $6 bucks, when I asked my companion was it $6 bucks worthy there was a reply of lacking flavor but the size was equivalent to 2 $3 bowls somewhere else. \nThe Brussel Sprouts: Now I confess I hadn't had brussel sprouts since at least 12 and that pushing it but I decided to step out of my comfort zone and try them roasted instead of boiled and I am now a fan. The sesame oil was perfect and they were charred just enough to elicit the flavor of the sprouts to be slightly sweet.\nTuna Crudo: My companions loved this dish and advised the truffle oil was slightly overwhelming but delectable.\nPork Gyoza: Always good and great with the left over truffle oil\n\nThe perk of sitting at the bar was watching the chefs make the rolls and trying to figure out which one was ours. There is a mirror above the bar and more than once did we find ourselves staring at what was going on. We ordered 4 rolls to share: Fishtown, Old City, J&J and the Real California. The J&J was my favorite the shishito pepper would kick in right at the end for a spicy finish. The Old City looked to be the most popular coming off the bar and it made sense - its a instagramable plate in its own right and has a good flavor combo. I initially ordered the Fishtown and depending on what piece of fish you got on top kinda determined if it worked in my opinion. We decided to try the Real California roll for fun and honestly I could have done without.\n\nOverall I liked it and would try it again.

Another plus: their menu is extensive, serving up specialty drinks as well (Credo, please expand, I can't drink straight coffee!). ROAST also serves food and wine after 4pm, which makes me want to return ASAP!\n\nFor that day though, we were happy with our drinks. Joe and his regular latte, decorated with their signature 'R' (to go, because he just had a cup of coffee with breakfast), and a dark chocolate mocha for me. This is the first time I've ever had a mocha where I didn't find was too bitter (aside from anything served at Starbucks, pure cream and sugar). Absolutely loved my drink!\n\nROAST Coffeehouse, thus far, is my favorite out of all coffee hangouts. Runner-up: Wild Earth Bakery. I only wished I discovered these places when I was in school!

Spacious & Airy it felt very comfortable.  The staff behind the counter were uber friendly and helpful.  They alone deserve 5 stars each for outstanding customer service.  They were chatty and very accommodating with our kids which also impressed us.\n\nWe picked up a few items to try, the cookie topped doughnut, maple bacon cinnamon bun, cookies and a pain au chocolat.  Also indulged in some hot cocoa (kids), a cappuccino for me and hubs tried the salted caramel latte.  Everything was heavenly but the salted caramel latte was the big winner for me and well the maple bacon cinnamon bun for hubs (anything with bacon, right?).  They also had a Bacon Latte on the menu but were out of the candied bacon so we didn't get to try (this time).\n\nThe next day we stopped in on our way out of town.  The same friendly peeps were working behind the counter and remembered us.

From the art installments, to the Halloween Parties and Ghost Tours to the building being empty for years.  When I was at the City Market downtown one weekend, I saw that they were restoring the building and it looked like maybe some new tenants.  I hoped that they were businesses and that they were not turning it into condos.\n\nMy prayers were answered and Roast Coffeehouse and Mercer Tavern were soon to be opened.\n\nYou would think that with my food obsession I would be one of the first people in on opening day...  Due to the busy summer I did not get to visit Roast until almost the end of August.  I had saw a tweet about a Maple Bacon Latte and knew I would have to drop in to see what they were all about.\n\nThe Bacon-Maple Latte is a maple flavoured latte. It is garnished with whipped cream and then a couple of pieces of caramelized Bacon.\n\nThe Bacon is fantastic! Crispy and gooey at the same time - it stuck to my teeth. Bacon lovers would love this taste experience.\n\nIf you want the latte to have any Bacon flavour in it you need to dunk one of your pieces of Bacon into the latte and let it float - that is, if you can resist eating it!\n\nThe Baristas at Roast took a while to get the latte out but it looked like they were having problems with one of the spouts on the espresso machine pulling shots. It was worth the wait - the shots were perfect.\n\nThe atmosphere and decor in Roast make for a very comfortable experience. The hardwood floors and open beamed ceiling are the originals from the warehouse. It has a rustic feel while the fireplaces give the atmosphere warmth and the stainless steel bar type chairs give it a touch of modern class. There are overstuffed leather chairs by the fireplaces so there are \"homey\" feels to certain areas as well. Sure to please many different types of customer.\n\nIf you like to avoid the hustle and bustle that the \"Green Giant\" offers - then you should give Roast a try. I can see myself curling up in front of a fireplace with a good book and a great cup of coffee for an hour or two.\n\nKudos Roast!", "date": "2012-12-17 21:26:56"}, {"_key": "5157595", "_id": "reviews/5157595", "_rev": "_fNzFzre--U", "review_id": "4ddtnrodqDji2beY2jNZcw", "user_id": "CYsju6m-r5sH2ZS_Gr_I4Q", "business_id": "WKMJwqnfZKsAae75RMP6jA", "stars": 3, "useful": 5, "funny": 0, "cool": 3, "text": "I'm on the fence about my feelings towards Roast Coffeehouse. While it does have many appealing qualities, there are certainly some things that are lacking. \n\nThe Good:\nThe space is lovely. It has great ambience and is roomy and stylish with plenty of comfortable seating. It's always cozy and warm, unlike many other cafes. There are nice little touches around, such as a self-serve dispenser with lemon water. This place doubles as a wine bar in the evenings and there's a  decent selection of wine and beer. The baked goods are also quite good. \n\nThe Bad:\nThe service here is hit or miss. On some days, I have been greeted by a friendly face and on other days, I have had to deal with an unhelpful and lackadaisical hipster, whose description of the maple bacon latte was simply that it is \"sweet\". \n\nWhile they do have a small food menu, I have not had the chance to try anything as the one time I wanted to order something, I was informed that they were sold out of everything. This was at 4.p.m., which is the advertised time that they start serving food. \n\nThe coffee here is ok. While they do have a selection of interesting and creative drinks (Maple Bacon latte, salted caramel latte etc.), the actual quality and taste of the espresso is on par with, or marginally above,  most chain coffee shops. For the prices listed, you would expect better quality. This is not to say that the drinks are bad -- only that they could, and should, be better. \n\n\nI will continue going to Roast, mainly for the ambience.

I have gone there on 7 different occasions to order different drinks each time and I am always told \"sorry we're out of this, or we're out of that\" Thus forcing me to order a drink I could get anywhere and was really less than thrilled about trying.

Never in my whole entire life have I ever been to a place that handled a situation so horribly.

The host was very nice and was trying her best. \n We finally get sat and get drinks ordered and Our appetizers. It's going well, our server was nice and we were happy. Now this is where it goes down hill. Our appetizers come out about 5-10 mins apart. We brushed it off. A party that got sat after us were now getting their entrees? We start getting irritable at this time we've been in the restaurant for 2 hours. We finally start getting out entrees. 5 people are missing theirs. Sever comes over tells our friend their out of what she wanted. Would've been nice to know before everyone stared receiving their food. But she got to pick whatever she wanted for free, not bad. Everyone is now done with their meals and My friend beside me never got her food. By this time the restaurant is basically empty. The manager comes over and just goes \" what did you have\" my friend told her then she just walked away. No apology. Nothing. Her food finally comes out and she asks our sever why was she just now receiving her food? He replies with \"oh you know the kitchen gets slammed, things happen\" our jaws nearly hit the floor. Granted they comped her meal. But everything was poorly executed and the manager never stopped by to apologize, our server never apologized. \n  I guessed they assumed that they were gonna go down in flames cause they thought passing out a $5 off coupon for next time would do anything. Safe to say we spent 3 hours in a restaurant for a lousy experience. The food was decent but not worth it. Like the saying goes \" you can fix lousy food with great service but you can't fix lousy service with great food\" and we don't ever, ever plan on coming back here.

After about 15 minutes, we are still waiting for our food. All the employees keep looking at us nervously because they know it's been longer than 7 minutes. \n\nThe lady who rang us up briefly says something to the head honcho chef looking man and then brings our food to us.

It doesn't count for to go orders.\" No. I can tell right off the bat that's a load of crap so we ask to speak to the chef boss man. \n\nHere is a whole new problem.

Don't you dare address my 70 year old grandmother as \"girl.\" UGH. Anyways, he claims that corporate told them it doesn't count on carry out orders. I tell him to show me that on any one of their numerous advertisements. He can't because obviously he's lying. He just doesn't want to get dinged for being so slow.

Lack of concern? Lack of giving a crap about their patrons? Who knows. So I went there with my wife this past Monday night and our waitress was definitely not on point. Right out of the gate she asks us about our time constraints, and it was about 5:30 P.M. Now I can understand this logic if it were lunch time or earlier in the day, but that is literally the first time any waiter or waitress has ever asked me this at this time of the day. I hardly get asked this to begin with.\n\nNot that it mattered, even if we were on a time constraint, we sure as hell weren't going anywhere fast, because \"prompt service\" was clearly not in her vocabulary. My wife ordered a glass of Pinot Noir and I got a Soda and Salad to start off with. I get my drink and Salad within 5 minutes... Still no wine for my wife. She's going around attending to some of the other folks, then mentions that \"the wine is on the way.\" It's one glass of wine - what the hell? I didn't ask for a bottle of vintage wine from the Manager's personal stock at his house. 10 minutes later the wine gets there. My wife doesn't want to spoil the mood so I don't say anything, but I'm very visibly irritated and it's obvious at this point.\n\nWe had ordered around the time I got my salad, and come to find out now also, what my wife ordered she is just now finding out that they are \"out of\" for the night. Wonderful. So my food is almost ready at this point and my wife is having to re-order now. No offer to comp, no offer for complimentary dessert, nothing but pure apathy. Some of these waitresses and waiters wonder why people get crappy? Interesting.\n\nWe end up getting our food - I got the Chicken Marsala and my wife did a build your own spaghetti. My food went from pretty \"meh\" to kicking my ass afterward - it wasn't spicy at all yet it felt like fire coming out.\n\nI won't go on and on beyond this because I don't have much else nice to say.

Last week Macaroni Grill was running a special for 2 for one express lunches.  Normal cost is $7.00, but with the deal order one entree, get the second one for free.\nI work in a large office.  A number of people at the office decided this would be a great day to order lunch at Macaroni Grill and take advantage of the 2 for 1 price.  12-16 people placed orders online.  If you are in the restaurant the express lunch is $7.00 ready in 7 minutes or the order is free.  This is not true of the online ordering.  We were fine with this.  We were told by the online order the time our last order would be ready was about 20 minutes.  We arrived in 25 minutes in hopes our orders would be ready.  Long story short, they were not ready and we ended being at the restaurant 35 minutes waiting.  Lots of the food was cold, some people didn't get what they ordered and overall the initial experience was not good.  I called and asked to speak to the manager on duty.  It was Troy but he was behind the counter cooking to help get orders out.  This I could be believe because the restaurant was really really busy.\nI left my name and number and asked for him to call me back.  After the lunch rush he called me back.  He was extremely sincere and apologetic.  He asked where we worked and offered to make things right.  He gave us two choices.  He would provide a family style meal or we could do a \"do over\".  I choice the \"do over\" since the whole office didn't order didn't think it would be fair to bring in a family style meal and not share with everyone. Troy give me the direct number to him and told me when he would be in the restaurant.  \n\nToday was \"Do Over\" day.  I called about 45 minutes before we wanted to pick up the order.\nTroy remembered speaking to me ( it was 6 days ago), he asked for the orders no questions asked.  I gave him a list of orders and included each person's name. He asked when I wanted to pick up the order.  I said 11:30.  One of the items we ordered were cookies.  He explained they don't always have cookies but he would see what he could do for us. We got to the restaurant and could see things were much calmer.  Our order was being put together and we were asked to have a seat for a few minutes.  At most we waited 5 minutes and we were handed three bags of food, extra dressings, cheese and utensils.  I asked the two people who presented our food to thank Troy for us.  As we were walking out, he called to us and asked us to wait a minute.  He came up to us with freshly baked chocolate chip cookies still hot and gooey.  You could tell they had just come out of the oven. I thanked him again for making this right and going above and beyond.\n\nThank you again Troy for turning this around.  We will definitely be back.\nGrateful,\nLisa", "date": "2016-09-14 19:49:57"}, {"_key": "5002304", "_id": "reviews/5002304", "_rev": "_fNzFjOy--I", "review_id": "FBv80o03CxjgJ8l-uJOjPg", "user_id": "gVO3VZwCu54Otc7bUB33Mg", "business_id": "9OG5YkX1g2GReZM0AskizA", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "April 2, 2011 Saturday - Dinner 5:45 PM\n2 people (1 kid and me)\n\nAtmosphere - 5 stars\nFood - 4 stars\nService - 3 stars\n\nBackground - Been here many times in the past but do not remember how long it has been since the last visit, more than a year easily.\n\nAtmosphere - Dimly lit restaurant chain with a rustic \"Italian\" feel.

The sauce was not too sweet, just right, but there could have been more.  I would have loved to dip my bread into the sauce.  The chicken had little to no flavor; it could have been very firm tofu.  I would have preferred that the cannelloni be served on a plate instead of a flat wide bowl; it just made the use of a fork a little challenging, as the bowl served no purpose to hold anything in.\n\nDessert - We skipped this as I had planned on another location for this treat.\n\nService - The hostess indicated that was a small wait as they were cleaning and prepping the table, not an issue as I was expecting a wait.

And consistency is really the only factor that is just not quite where i'd like it to be. \n\nSome days the meal is delicious. Some days my entree was somehow never placed with the rest of my table's order. Some days my meal is a disaster. \n\nAs far as chain restaurants go, I'd still pick MG over almost anything else. \n\nAnd really, for a server to have to learn how to spell his/her name upside down and in crayon at every table without screwing up? That deserves some props. Not ever server at every restaurant has THAT as a prerequisite. (\"heh, well, so uh, actually my name is Antoinette.

According to the menu, this dish is grilled chicken breast, imported buffalo mozzarella, imported pomodorina, capellini but I've been on carb restricted diet so I opted out the capellini pasta and subbed the saut\u00e9ed spinach. So what arrived from the kitchen was a grilled, tough and dry chicken breast, uncooked (basically raw) spinach and a few clumps of mozzarella (which had a unusual taste I find hard to describe, but not as it should). There was no imported pomodorina nor did the dish look at all appetizing!\n\nI thought to myself after the runner left it on the table that I would never order this dish again even before I tasted it, so when our server Lura stopped shortly there after to check on the meal she could see immediately that I was not pleased and glanced at my plate and understood why. She politely asked me if she could make the matter right and took my plate back to the kitchen.\n\nShe returned a short while later with my dinner and brought the pomodorina which really helped the dish and a complete new order of the spinach (but again - was not really any better than the first version I was served). \n\nMy recommendation is with all the other menu options to choose from at Macaroni Grill, keep clear of this particular dish, but do ask for Lura because she is a delight and really tried her best to make this so-so meal a more pleasurable experience!", "date": "2019-11-26 05:18:58"}, {"_key": "5108568", "_id": "reviews/5108568", "_rev": "_fNzFy_G--T", "review_id": "WRi2mO8L-MmHe2fKjMsOww", "user_id": "vKUcRyICuLlZBe_Uxlc0HQ", "business_id": "9OG5YkX1g2GReZM0AskizA", "stars": 1, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This was by far the worst dinner we have had in a long time.

After asking a bartender if it was open sitting or if someone would seat us she helped us right away and sat us. No biggie. Inside was clean. Host sat us down next to the fire place where we would be warm! Very nice. Our waiter, by the name of Robert, introduced himself and instantly offered us a wine. We had the sausage rigatoni and spaghetti with meatballs. I ordered the sausage rigatoni spicy. Robert offered to bring out a few things to spice up our dish- nice touch! While waiting for our food we were brought the free bread with oil. To be honest, wasn't a big fan of the bread but no big deal! We didn't come here for the bread.

It was powdered cheese, kind a like the Parmesan shaker you get a pizza joint. They had a nice caramelization, tender, yet a little crunch. Can't ask for better.

I think that's just a matter of preference though. \n\nMy wife's shrimp was also cooked perfectly, it came with angel hair pasta and mushrooms. The flavor was a little bland. I think it was a garlic butter, but just not enough flavor for me. But she didn't complain lol. She did like the pinenuts in it and the green leaf vegetable in it.\n\nThe kids dishes had good flavor.

Only a few pieces of ravioli, burnt to the point of being inedible with a dash of (also burnt) mushroom gravy. I immediately called up the restaurant and demanded an explanation. I was told that the General Manager cooked this particular dish and that I would be getting a refund in a week. \nWell, it's been a week. I called and was told it might be another couple of weeks before I get my refund because the folks in the corporate office are only occasionally in the main office anymore. I did get an offer for them to remake my order. No thanks.

Our waiters name was Alfredo, I believe it was. His demeanor was pretty strange whenever he would come up to the table he would interrupt the conversation, make a strange joke and then before leaving he would take my nieces empty specialty drink glasses and bring refills without asking so throughout the entire meal we assumed that the refills were free. They both ordered the Alfredo with chicken added and I was told they were pretty underwhelmed by the under salted Alfredo and the dry chicken; for $14-17 per plate Its safe to say I expect a proper Alfredo. I ordered their \"signature\" truffle Mac and cheese and I didn't find it to be good at all; too much truffle oil, not enough salt, pepper or cheese.  When i was given the bill i was unpleasantly surprised to see we were charged for SIX specialty kid drinks for each time our waiter so kindly refilled their glasses without asking or informing that refills were full price or else I would have verbally declined.

The first guy was on speed or something and made it obvious that he was annoyed when we asked for bread and other simple requests. During this same trip we waited there for over an hour for two simple salads. \n\nDuring our next visit, it was clear that the waiter was hung over. In fact I think he may have been still drunk from the night before. He even knocked over a couple of glasses at different tables. He would constantly repeat his introduction even though he had already been by to take our order. Finally after 30 minutes our salads and soup came. The soup was ok, but the salad was old and the croutons were so disgusting that my girl friend spit them out. They were beyond stale. Our eggplant Parmesan took over 1 hour and 45 minutes to make. We literally were getting up to walk out when it arrived. To make matters worse, the red sauce was so cold that parts of it were still frozen. The eggplant was disgusting as well, we needed a steak knife to cut it. Then the manager came by as she could tell we weren't happy. Her attitude from the very beginning was very defensive. We explained our frustration with the salad, wait time, staff, and entree. She immediately tried to justify the wait time by saying eggplant takes at least an hour to cook. She then claimed that the croutons were made about an hour ago - clearly a bunch of BS. She concluded with \"I'm not supposed to tell you this but our eggplant is very earthy\". Whatever that means. I've had eggplant at other fine restaurants and it never takes longer than 30 minutes to cook nor does it take much effort to cut.

They aren't over the top, with a cheesy \"hello and how may I help you's\" only to scurry from the table as quickly as possible.

The bread is warm a loaded with rosemary flavor, I always request balsamic with my dipping Olive oil. Each dish has a unique flavor profile not just your typical Italian style chain where the only options are salty cheesy or salty tomato. People have complained about portion size/cost ratio on other reviews but honestly, I have never left here anything less than STUFFED with left overs for lunch the next day.

Huge mistake. Our party was for 20 people. They had our table set up in a separate room with another group which was fine, plenty of room. The first mistake they made was allowing us to order direct from the menu. In our past experience at other restaurants, we have been given a limited menu which allows the kitchen a better opportunity to get everyone's food out in a timely manner. When we arrived our table was set up but had no menus on the table and no waters. Our waiter came over to take drink orders and everything seemed like it might start to be normal. He left with our drink orders and drinks slowly made their way to our table, still no waters or menus. Everyone immediately ordered a second drink because the first drink took so long. Finally, menus arrived...still no water and no one asked if we wanted water. I noticed that our waiter was basically by himself to handle our entire table. Again, at other restaurants, we are used to having 2 or 3 servers handle our large group. We ordered appetizers, again they slowly made their way to the table. We ordered our main courses. Entrees started to make their way to the table and it quickly became apparent that only half the table received their main course. The waiter came over and stated he messed up and lost half our orders, he took the orders a second time for those of us that did not receive any food. Again, these orders slowly made their way to the table and they were still missing 5 people. We sat down at 6pm it is now 8pm, two hours in a 5 people didn't have their food. The waiter and manager came over this time to ask once again what we were missing. 3 of the 5 ordered again, myself and one other guest decided not to re-order. I have worked in the food & beverage industry and have had many group gatherings at restaurants over the years and I have to say that Macaroni Grill was the least prepared to handle a group I have ever seen. When companies like ours plan these parties it is usually once a year and it is an important event to show our appreciation to our employees, to have it go so painfully wrong is not only upsetting but unacceptable for a restaurant like Macaroni Grill. One server assigned to our table, no menus on the table, no waters on the table, our guests having to go to the bar to get their own water and drinks, missing food orders, 2 hours into the party and guests still without food. This says to me very clearly that Macaroni Grill is improperly managed and they do not have a clue as to how to handle a group party. The manager ultimately took 25% off the bill and the waiter removed a couple of wines and coffee, none of which made the evening any less intolerable.

For my entr\u00e9e I ordered the Cafe Milano which was also yummy. The ingredients such as the mushrooms tasted fresh and the chicken was well seasoned. The tiramisu was really good  and I'd come back here only to eat that. \n\nI want to mention that you are paying for the ambience of the establishment. The food is marked up by a lot which I would not mind if it weren't for the sub par service and atmosphere as mentioned earlier.

I only went back because it was a lunch date with my little sister and she picked it out (even though I suggested other places, she likes \"italian\" food and wanted to try this)\n\nI realize everyone is cutting back these days, so I wasn't surprised to see they no longer had fresh cut flowers but other than that the interior was as I remembered it.  Still cozy and lovely with the dim lighting and spacious seating.  \n\nThe menu looked different from what I remembered, and they were featuring a promotional tapas for 2 menu.  1 tapa (appetizer) and 1 entree pp.  These were generally the cheaper menu items, but still a savings of $2-$6 pp if you were to order an app and entree each.  I think there was a selection of about 6 different items on each section.  They were out of the only entree that appealed to me and would not make a comparable substitution.  I wanted the chicken and mushroom cannelloni but ended up with a grilled chicken breast with angel hair pasta caprese.  My sister chose a creamy rigatoni dish with chicken.  We shared the goat cheese stuffed peppers and the zucchini fritto.  \n\nThe portions were large but the food was disgusting.  The zucchini fritto was paperthin slices of zucchini breaded and fried.  There were burned bits and other bits that were doughy and clumped together.  It lacked flavor and was greasy.  The peppers were interesting, tangy pickled peppers stuffed with cream cheese and heated then topped with fried bread crumbs and balsamic glaze drizzle.  I think they would have been much better served cold.  My sisters pasta was a giant bowl of rigatoni in a watery sauce and slices of chicken breast that look like the type of pressed chicken you get in school lunches.  Even with a lot of added parmesean cheese it was very bland.  My dish was a tough black charred chicken breast (again, tasted like formed chicken)  a glob of solidified angel hair pasta with a few cubes of mozzerella all melted together with wilted basil (I'm guessing my dish sat under a heater for a while).  The arugula salad it was served with was mostly spinach, again wilted with a dab of garlicky pesto.  I had literally two bites of food before I pushed my plate away. The chicken was dry and tough and tasted of salt and char, the pasta tasted of salt and old tomatoes.  I did enjoy the warm bread.  \n\nAside from terrible food, my final gripe is a petty one.  My sister ordered a peach lemonade and I ordered an \"italian soda\" which was soda water plus the same peach syrup in my sister's lemonade.  These beverages were listed together on the menu (no price listed so I assumed they were overpriced).  They were $3 each, but what annoyed me was that I asked for a refill and was told the soda did not have refills, but the lemonade did.  My soda came in a tall narrow glass packed with ice and could not have held more than 4 oz of liquid in all.  My sister's lemonade was a 20oz glass with about 1/4 full of ice.  I could understand if they opened a fresh bottle of pellegrino per soda, but this was just soda water from a soda gun so I don't see why it would cost more for refills?  Or why it wasn't listed separate from the free refill drinks like tea and lemonade?", "date": "2012-03-22 02:13:13"}, {"_key": "5363826", "_id": "reviews/5363826", "_rev": "_fNzF9Dm--L", "review_id": "96E7w8oVBvo6Bsx74Q2PNw", "user_id": "MRA9NERlBKPLRuF-qJdIgQ", "business_id": "9OG5YkX1g2GReZM0AskizA", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This was my first time coming, the food was well prepared and nice and fresh.

The waitress/hostess that greeted us was very friendly and sat us immediately. She was friendly and professional. The only concern I have is that she wore an extreme amount of perfume. It made me gag when she came by the table to ask us for drinks. Also, when she brought the bread and olive oil, the bottom of the bread was rockhard. The top was soft however we could not cut through the bottom without a saw. Our server care of this immediately. It was kind of hard to taste the bread with the perfume wafting around us. \n\nThe price has definitely increased as the bottle of wine was quoted at $48. I remember just before Covid being here and the bottle is $32. So I asked for a wine list. She said they did not have one but she knew everything about the wines. Luckily I had an old picture of the wine menu and showed it to her. She went to check the prices and then quoted me $38 for a bottle and apologized. It is somewhat difficult to not have the ability to look at the list of wines and their prices. Especially when you were quoted $16 more than the last time you visited.\n\nWhat we ordered:\n\nDrinks: went with a bottle of wine. My wife likes sweeter wines so I ordered a bottle of Reisling (Chateau St. Michelle) \n\nLamb Shank \nSteak and mash\nGrilled asparagus \n\nThe food is extremely good. The lamb shank pulled apart with a fork. The steak was cooked perfectly and had a great flavor. My wife really loved the style of mashed potatoes. For a side of asparagus, it seemed a bit small. But it was definitely cooked nicely.\n\nI do hope the waitress reads this review and adjust her perfume. With a sidenote, if you wear the same perfume over and over, sometimes you get desensitized to the smell and you have to apply more so you can smell it.

Our waitress was LOVELY. She walked us through pretty much the whole menu as well as explaining some of the drink options as well. \n\nI started with a sake that the restaurant had on tap, which was wonderful. my husband tried one of their cocktails and then stuck with his favorite Manhattan after that. \n\nWe started with the okonomiyaki (a Japanese pancake, at Green Pheasant made with ham, bacon, scallops, potatoes, and various traditional okonomi toppings). It was good, but not my favorite thing we ate. Next we tried the shumai (at Green Pheasant, made with lobster and spot prawn - and served with clover ponzu) - these were okay, but definitely my least favorite thing we ordered (they had a slightly strange flavor to me, but that may be because I'm so used to shumai made with shrimp only). \n\nNext we had the spicy crab noodles (with crab butter, sweet red crab, and tobanjan), which were very good. Lots of crab on the dish, and it was just the right amount of heat! \n\nBut the Ikinari steak was my favorite of the appetizers or entrees we ordered! The steak was American skirt steak with corn and onion and miso brown butter and j sauce, served in a hot hot hot sizzle plate like is traditional at the Japanese steak restaurant chain Ikinari (picture a fajita platter at a Tex Mex restaurant). The steak was great (perfectly cooked); the corn and onions were charred where they had touched the hot sizzle plate; and the miso brown butter was just the right richness for the steak. I'd come back to Green Pheasant just to eat this again. A great dish.\n\nBut we didn't stop there. We ordered two of the desserts as well. I ordered the ginger creme brulee which was SENSATIONAL (I might be back at Green Pheasant again soon - I want to sit at the bar, order some sake or shochu, and eat the Ikinari steak and the ginger creme brulee. Quite simply one of the best desserts I've had recently. The ginger flavor was amazing, and the creme brulee was so smooth. I LOVED IT. My husband has about 10x the sweet tooth I do and he ordered the tempura fried slice of chocolate cake. I tried a teeny tiny bite, and it's just WAAAAAAY too rich and sweet for me, but he enjoyed it (definitely for people who love sweet, rich desserts only). \n\nWe had a couple more drinks (including a shochu cocktail that was DELICIOUS). The service was excellent, and the restaurant pretty nice (I do think sitting downstairs is probably nicer, because upstairs is pretty sparse compared to the decor on the main level).

On a cool and rainy winter night it felt kind of drafty and chilly. But we were excited to check out this new place. \nThe menu is simple and split up into two sections: cold and hot. Since it was so chilly we only got one thing from the cold menu: the Tsukemono. I think of Tsukemono as pickled vegetables and was expecting such, but instead got a mixed greens salad with some chunks of raw fish in it. The chunks of raw fish were quite good, and though it seemed like scraps from other raw fish plates, we enjoyed it. I love scraps and not wasting!\nWe then moved onto our hot plates. When we asked our waitress about the order and timing she promised all of our dishes would not arrive at the same time and she was right. They all arrived at the same time except for the one larger dish we had ordered. Eh, a few kinks to a new restaurant.  I understand. \nThe dishes:\nDan Dan shishito. I love Dan dan Mian the spicy Sichuan noodle dish and I like shishito peppers so we got this. It was a competition on the plate: the shishito vs the dan dan. There is not room in the bowl for two such strong flavors! Neither won. \nWe then got the kinoko: warm mushrooms with finely grated cheese on top. A salty warm cheesy dish which felt good on a drafty evening. A small bowl for $13 or so but who's counting?\nThe star of the night was the stuffed chicken wings: the tebasaki gyoza. The bone removed from the meaty half of the wing and a shrimp toast mixture stuffed in, it was warm, savory and my favorite. Three wings on a plate if you were wondering how many to order for a table. \nFinally we got the trout: a good idea of a whole trout lightly fried with cold slaw and three little steamed bread pieces to make your own little baozi\nof fish and slaw. Fish was a little overdone and slaw was a little mayo-naisey for our taste. I think we would have preferred a sharper crisper more vinegar heavy slaw. \nOverall, I think it has potential, but needs to work on some execution and pricing. I mean $22 for a bowl for potato udon?

The spirits and sake list is located under the table in a secret pocket. They have a sake somm. Who is very knowledgeable about her selection and it's not small by any means, the Japanese whisky list is also very impressive I got to try a few whisky's I haven't tried yet.\n\nWe started with a few cold items the wedges which were awesome very light crisp and full of flavor, first off everything is full of flavor. The tsukemono was perfectly seasoned and fresh, the chirashi was also very fresh and had walu, oprah, and ora king salmon. I definitely reccomend starting with the cold before the hot because the dishes come out as ready. After chatting with the sake somm. And ordering a bottle of the otokoyama we ordered from the hot list. Jesse our waiter was very helpful with our questions and very attentive to our table. We ordered the (pics available) Dan Dan shishitos, the brocolini with rock shrimp (order this please) the kinoko which is a mushroom miso flavor bomb, the ika karaage which is basically tempura squid, the spicy crab noodle is a must every noodle is covered in great sauce the noodles al dente (another please order)the shuman came next and they didn't disappoint either but now I'm starting to think I ordered too much oops... on to the Jidori chicken a never ever chicken and I don't mean not to order it, it was fried to perfection came with a kewpie mayo and a sweet and spicy sauce. I just meant it's a strain of chicken that's DNA has never been tampered with by humans and is raised in completely open pens not the kind PETA shows in those tapes and fed an organic Vegan diet. On to the beef I'm dying a happy death at this point... the first two to show up was the mishima ranch American wagyu and the A5 miyazaki prefecture wagyu both very tender and cooked to perfection the American wagyu has more bite to it but the A5 is like seared foie gras melt in your mouth yummy goodness. Last but not least the American skirt steak showed up ... truly a sizzling flavor bomb the corn the onions the miso butter and the j sauce make sure to get everything in one bite for the perfect bite. I've been writing so much I forgot to talk about the trout just check the pictures ... kudos to chef Kynsey and her amazing staff the GM Michael seale for coming to the table and chatting with us Kristin breringson for the awesome recommendations and most of all Jesse for taking care of us and making sure put needs were met.

Anyways, the menu items were expectantly  priced for the type of venue Green Pheasant was. I don't think anything was below $10 and one of their entrees was around $25 per ounce (minimum of 4 ounces per order) for examples. Even though the price can be a bit steep, the food was well worth it and tasted delicious. You get an adequate and satisfying portion unlike some more higher end places so you don't feel like you paid for one little piece of meat or lettuce.

Everyone raves about the spicy crab noodles and for good reason. Ours could have been a touch hotter in my opinion but once I had that first butter savory umami bite I couldn't part with it. I would come back here often just for this dish alone. We also fell in love with the Tebasaki gyoza. At first when they brought it to our table we were confused as we expected some traditional dumplings, but when our waiter explained how the dumpling filling is stuffed into the chicken wing we raised our eyebrows a bit, took a bite and were astounded at the taste and experience of such an innovative concept. It's hard to surprise me with food and yet this did. My wife still talks about this dish and for good reason. Mindblowingly amazing! We had the broccolini and shrimp dish as well which was fantastic, but compared to the other dishes we ordered, was not in the same stratosphere. Great but not innovative or life-changing. We had the cheapest steak on their menu, which in hindsight I wish I would have insisted on the wagyu or something, but my wife devoured the american steak and claimed it as her favorite steak for some time (I assume that excludes my weekly sous vide offerings). I found the steak befitting of the other dishes and the exquisite ambiance. As much as I enjoyed it, I would def order the crab noodles and gyoza again, but would be interested in trying a different steak next time. \n\nThe restaurant is gorgeous, elegant and stately without being pretentious or overstated.

After a quick bathroom break, our party ordered a round of drinks from the bar to help us maintain our patience as the minutes melted off of the clock.

Before we headed upstairs, I asked him what he would do to help rectify the situation. \"The first round of drinks is on me, but I will NOT cover the second.\" Ridiculous.... \n\nOnce we were seated, I must confess that the remainder of our time was quite enjoyable. From our friendly waiter, Spencer, delicious small plates, and smooth Japanese Whiskey- the second act of the night met my expectations. The heated toilet seats were also a big hit with the ladies.

To start, we ordered the broccolini appetizer with hot rock shrimp, cornbread, sudachi, shoyu. The fusion didn't work well for me at all. For our main, we shared the spicy crab noodle with crab butter, sweet red crab, tobanjan. And again, nothing to write home about. The creme brule definitely takes the cake here.

Now, if only I had a date to take with me!\n\nThat was pretty exciting first paragraph, wasn't it? The breakdown is pretty clear. When you arrive, valet the car with the restaurant. Just do it and quit groaning at the suggestion. This will make your life a whole lot easier for a stress-free starter to your date. Go to the hostess desk where they will seat you for your reservation that you made 2 weeks ago. As they take you to your table, observe the ambiance. Will they take you to the upstairs with the quirky bathrooms? Will they take you to the main dining room where there is a central bar to people watch or are they going to take you to your private dining room with the awesome wallpaper of CCTV cameras and roses? Yes, you read that right. If you are able, take some photos in there because the wallpaper is totally worth a photo of. Most of the restaurant should find itself in a covershoot in Nashville Scene. Who doesn't love green and red velvet everywhere!?\n\nNow that you're seated, take it all in. Check out the menu and inhale all of the quirky offerings on the menu. But before ordering food, get your sake order in and prepare for a toast! You can get that unique cocktail you were eyeing in the next round. This round is about sharing the moment you realized you're about to have one of the best damn dining experiences in Nashville. Kanpai! ('Cheers' in Japanese)\n\nYou've looked over the menu and you're going to order 4-5 items between you and your dining companion. They offer everything from vegetarian to what I'd consider a very large unsightly fish on a plate ready for consumption. I don't like whole fish, but the table next to us certainly did! Whatever you palette wishes is Green Pheasant's command.\n\nThe experience exceeds just the dining portion. Let's talk service. Carlos was exceptional. Beyond words, topnotch, never missed a beat, glowing service. He was hospitable, prompt, and very nurturing to our table. He never hoovered and we never had to ask for anything. He was like a genie who appeared when I had a fleeting thought of needing a beverage or another glass of water. We also appreciated his knowledge of the cuisine and his mindfulness of our spice-level tolerance. We ordered based on his recommendations and we loved every last thing he suggested.\n\nAfter 2.5 hours of eating and drinking, it is time to go. Time to wrap up and get going. But, you do not exit without leaving a gigantic tip for the awesome server you just had, and you do not omit grabbing a couple of photos of yourself with your dining partner to capture the experience that will be ingrained in your culinary memory for a life time. Bask in the moment while you can. You'll return soon, but in the meantime, enjoy the moment at this moment.\n\nHave fun? I know I did.

It started with check-in and seating. When we arrived, the two hosts, clearly flustered and whom I felt badly for if I'm being honest as they were overwhelmed, were arguing with each other over a table that had been somehow mis-seated. They audibly (and in front of other guests) tried to work this issue out but meanwhile let other guests linger in the very small waiting area in the front without explanation. \n\nAfter checking-in at 8:10pm for our 8:15pm reservation, we were told our table wasn't yet ready and when we asked approximately how long the wait would be, we were told \"tables are just lingering, so please head to the bar.\" Anyone who's worked in the Industry understands occasionally this happens after check drops, especially on weekends, however to my surprise upon walking in the dining room I observe multiple open tables/tables that need to be serviced and flipped. \n\nWe are forced to sit at the bar (where the service was really less than stellar and/or quick) until 8:45pm and I'm convinced the only reason we got a table is because a member of our party kept continually checking in with the host to inquire about our reservation. \n\nOnce seated (and starving), we received a brief apology from our server and he noted that this \"happens around the 8pm reservation time sometimes,\" so it seems like this seating delay is a common problem Green Pheasant is aware of. We immediately ordered some dishes because we were starving. Since the first two were raw foods, they were delivered to us fairly quickly. The rest took FOREVER. We were told the kitchen was very backed up and they'd come out as they were ready. To say this was frustrating after our wait to be seated was an understatement. \n\nI observed a manager on the restaurant floor in our area only once throughout the night. He never did a table touch to ask about or experience in general, or to apologize for the wait for the table or food delays. There was no good faith gesture of any sort or acknowledgement from the restaurant regarding our experience beyond the very brief apology from our server, who obviously doesn't control the kitchen volume. \n\nThe food was decent but to be honest, I was so hungry by the time any food came out, I would have eaten just about anything. \n\nTo summarize, I would never return to The Green Pheasant and am baffled by the positive reviews of this restaurant given what I experienced, observed, and discussed with fellow diners while at the restaurant.

That was followed by lobster and spot prawn shu mai; unlike many restaurant dishes that claim to feature lobster, the succulent crustacean was very present in this one. Then a riff on okonomiyaki; a hash brown pancake with traditional okonomiyaki toppings and sauces. It was like an asian latke; perfect for this time of year. We finished with the whole trout, fried and served with thinly sliced cucumbers, asian slaw and steamed buns. The trout was cooked perfectly; it was silky and juicy. One thing to note; for a restaurant that features a sharing menu, a puzzling number of items came out in odd numbers. 5 shu mai, three steamed buns with the trout; Management-how about 6 shu mai and 4 steamed buns so a pair of enthusiastic and hungry diners don't have to fight over the \"odd bun out\"? \n\nIn any event, the food was fabulous, and the bill for the meal, with 2 craft cocktails, came out to less than $100.

We had the tuna tartar which had a decent flavor but was warm and chopped up so much that one would wonder if they were trying to hide that they were using poor quality tuna. Imagine room temperature cat food on top of warm rice cake. The whole thing did not work. \nThen to the entree. The steak was good but salty. The spicy crab pasta which is their signature dish came out cold and way after the steak. When we told the waiter it was cool, we were told it was because the noodle was rinsed and would never be piping hot. I'm sorry but a bit warmer than cold doesn't cut it. This was also very salty and I was told it was because I asked for spicy and they added chili sauce. Really?  The chef does not know how to make things spicier without making it so salty you can't eat?  So to save time and by this point my husband had already finished his steak so I asked for some plain hot noodles to be added. \nThey brought some dumplings while waiting which was a nice touch but please don't bother ordering. They are less than tasty. \n\nFinally the noodles came out and they added garlic butter which made the plain pasta salty again. JAPANESE FOOD DOES NOT HAVE TO BE SALTY. \nBy now we were ready to get out of this pretentious place. The bill came out and they had charged us 14 for the noodles. So they charged 26 for salty lukewarm entree that was not edible as it was, then charged 14 more for what I had hoped to be warm plain noodles. So basically we were asked to pay 40 for a mediocre dish. We complained and they took it off the bill but that should have never happened. \n\nMy prediction is that the place would not survive if they do not improve the quality of their food.

I'm not sure to whom I am applauding--their interior designers, the servers, the chefs, but everyone gets a big high five. This was one of the best dining experiences I've had in Nashville. The meal was exceptional from start to finish. \n\nThe service--\nWe had made a reservation on Resy through their website and we were seated promptly on-time. When we were seated we were brought warm towels to wipe our hands. Our server greeted us and was very accommodating. She was the best! \n\nThe ambiance--\nThere was a slight Asian flavor to the decor but everything was very modern. Some of the seating had plush booths and some were tables. There was a center bar for people who just came to get drinks. The restrooms were very clean and to our amusement and delight they had  Japanese toilets which had a seat warming feature. \n\nThe food--\nTheir menu consists of a cold section and a hot section. There aren't appetizers but the menu is mostly small plates and then towards the bottom of the menu the plates get larger. Our server went into the most detail of the menu of any server that I've ever had. It was great. She highlighted her favorite dishes but gave an explanation of how the dishes were prepared so we knew what to expect. We ordered: \n-Spicy crab noodles: buttered noodles with crab meat. My favorite, but apparently also most people's favorite since our server has said that every table will likely have one order of these. \n-Tebasaki gyoza: This dish blew my mind. Instead of the chicken stuffed into a traditional gyoza dumpling, the gyoza is stuffed into the chicken wing. It is deboned except for the end of the wing so you are getting a crispy chicken with the filling of the gyoza in the center. \n-Kinoko: These were different kinds of mushroom with Parmesan. They had such a great earthy flavor and a light broth.\n-Broccolini with corn bread and rock shrimp: This dish seemed like an interesting pairing but everything worked together. The sauce for the broccolini was delicious and the rock shrimp had a different seasoning which worked together\n-Wedges: This was the one dish I could have done without, but it was still good. The salad was served on skewers with dressing and shaved carrots. \n\nThe ambiance, the service and the food was all amazing. High marks for all. The dinner was very memorable and enjoyable.

I had dinner last night here for my birthday and it was delicious! I would recommend making a reservation though, especially on the weekend. Our reservation was at 8:30 and our table wasn't quite ready yet when we got there so we got a drink at the bar while we waited. Our table was ready about 15 minutes later at 8:45, but it was worth the wait because they seated us on the first level at a little booth with plush velvet, super comfortable!\n\nSide note: do not forget your ID especially on your birthday! I'm embarrassed to say that I made this mistake (I had switched purses, it's a girl thing) so I had to run home to grab it. So it was fine that our table wasn't ready right away. And the bartender was so nice and felt bad that I had to run home he ended up buying my first drink! I believe his name was Mike, super friendly and great bartender. \n\nThere was just two of us and we ordered 5 dishes which was the right amount of food for us. They are tapas style and made for sharing it seems. Our food also came out pretty quick. We were full by the end but not busting at the seams. They bring each dish out as they are ready instead of bringing it all out at once which I like so you're not waiting for a long time to eat. \n\nWe started off with the wedge salad. It was skewers of lettuce with a ginger dressing on top. Fresh and tasty, although maybe a little pricey. \n\nNext we had the Okonomiyaki which was delicious. It was a crispy savory hashbrown type pancake with sauces and toppings on top. Highly recommend!\n\nThen we had the Tebasaki Gyoza. Do not be fooled by the name, it is not a gyoza. It is actually a deboned chicken wing stuffed with a mixture of shrimp. There is a chili sauce for dipping. This is probably unusual for most people. The outer crust was super crispy which I loved. It had also come out super fresh and hot. A sign it was made to order and hadn't been sitting for a while. My boyfriend was so so about this dish, but I really liked it. So it depends on the person. \n\nAfter came the spicy crab noodles which had come highly recommended. It was very saucy and rich. It wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be although there was a good amount of crab in there. I would recommend mixing it up before you start as all of our crab and stuff had kind of settled towards the bottom. I didn't end up loving this dish as I had thought I would. The flavors were a bit muddled and maybe a little too rich for me. \n\nLastly, we had the ikinari steak. It's American skirt steak on a bed of sweet corn and onions with a generous scoop of the miso butter. It was cooked perfectly medium rare and came out on a sizzling skillet. So for those who don't like their meet too rare, it does continue to cook a bit after it comes out. The steak was super tender and had a sauce on top. For me it could have had a little less sauce so the steak could shine, but still delicious nevertheless. It was a little difficult to eat the corn with chopsticks though haha. I could have asked for other utensils, but I didn't want to be \"that person.\"\n\nOverall it was a great experience. The decor instead was beautiful, with a mix of mid century furniture and more luxurious touches like the velvet booths.

Essentially no where legally for us to park to wait for the valet.

It is mid-century, dimly lit, with grand emerald green velvet seats and walls of the same color. It's going to give date night spots in town a run for the money. The vibe is upscale with house lounge music (loud and could be toned down). Plus, the serving ware is gorgeous. The dish added to the beauty of the dish. (I dunno how I felt about wooden chopsticks, though. It's definitely more practical, but did take away from the elegance). So just for the ambience TGP deserves more than 5 stars. \n\nTGP has a well curated menu. There is plenty to choose from, although vegetarian options maybe limited. They use fine quality ingredients like Jidori chicken, and mushrooms too fancy to google (kidding!). Also, there isn't sushi, ramen or yakitori for dinner. The portions are small, sharing size, but given Japanese cuisine is all about clean light and bright flavors, those elements alone will satisfy your appetite. The menu is divided into Cold and Hot; within the hot, light to heavy dishes.\n\nThe Sunomono: To dumb it down-fancy poke. To elevate it- fresh, cooling, and edible flowers. The moonfish is gorgeous and the coolness from the cucumber ironically punches through. \n\nTebasaki gyoza: You haven't had chicken wings like this before. The inside is filled with shrimp. I don't know where the croissant is, in the filling or the crumb coat, but either way, stuffed wing like no other. Delicious, light, juicy and crunchy with an element of surprise. The sweet chile sauce seemed like the regular kind, I couldn't tell if it was house-made. \n\nIkinari steak: Don't let the size fool you. It is rich and a very heavy dish. Comes out in a sizzling skillet. A huge dollop of miso brown butter, looks like gold and feels as rich, makes the steak outstanding. The skirt steak is cooked to perfection-  medium rare, tender juicy and a delicious char and asian flavor. The caramelized onions and corn really compliment the richness from the butter and sauce. Great fusion. \n\nFried Tempura Chocolate Cake: I am not a big fan of the chewiness in mochi, so I went with the extreme opposite: texture bomb! This is a molten chocolate cake fried in tempura batter with dulce de leche sauce, with a side of ice cream, topped with sauteed puffed rice. So you have the ooey goeey, the crispy, crunchy, hot cold, solid and liquid.  Decadent, much? Most definitely. \nIn spite of the multiple textures, it felt one note- very sweet. I wish they had some salt or citrus to cut the richness. \n\nGranted, I have not had enough Japanese food of this kind to compare so I may not be the best judge. I think the food is delicious and of high quality, but I just wasn't wowed by the flavors. It was an elevation of the quality and ingredients of the familiar asian flavors.\n\nThey have midday and lunch offerings too which would be great to try out. Prices are comparable, portions depending on the item maybe on the smaller side. \n\nThe service is great. We actually went with the recommendations of our host who told us about the dishes. There is ample seating. \n\nThe reason I was a little annoyed, I picked the wrong premier parking garage downtown (222 parking is the closest to TGP) and by the time I walked over to catch the midday menu, with ten minutes to spare till dinner at 5pm I couldn't order off it. So although the midday is till 5 it isn't. But I agree that's me being pesky. \n\nNonetheless, next time. TGP is a great addition to downtown. The upscale Japanese food makes it very unique. And it is a very promising restaurant.", "date": "2018-11-21 19:59:46"}, {"_key": "5430157", "_id": "reviews/5430157", "_rev": "_fNzG_XW--M", "review_id": "fcH4ClUjEYlg5mYKpXU21w", "user_id": "U-E3AswKCLoo7e_mpCPboQ", "business_id": "tMkwHmWFUEXrC9ZduonpTg", "stars": 1, "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Waaay overhyped.

He also asked us to pick two to three things at a time because as soon as the chef prepares each dish, it is brought to the table immediately. Thus, this was the pattern we created.

The flinstones push pop had a scoop of berry sorbet, prosecco, and I believe a lavender liquor. It surprisingly wasn't too sweet and will definitely be a summertime favorite. The spiked hot chocolate was made from belgian chocolate and had a giant toasted marshmallow on top. It was honestly the best hot chocolate I have ever had and I definitely couldn't stop myself from slurping it down too fast! The old fashioned was pretty good too, and we definitely loved the banana Jameson. For the Irish whiskey lover it's a must try!

Bar One isn't it.\n\n     Let's start with what it is, though. Can you go have a beer with your friends, and watch a little of the game? Yes, you definitely can. Do they have a beer list which comparable to other crafty, Philly spots? Yes, definitely. Is it crazy expensive, or crazy crowded? Nope...it's ostensibly a neighborhood bar.\n\n     By no stretch of the imagination is it an Italian restaurant. Frankly, I'm not sure why Bar One even bothers to pretend it is such...perhaps the neighborhood, or proximity to the market...but at any rate, fine Italian cuisine it is not. Excited to try a new spot, stopped in on a brisk Friday in November and, ordered the cavatelli with Gorgonzola sauce and sausage. The most notable issue was that there was no sausage. Strike one. I could not identify the flavor of Gorgonzola in the pale grey sauce either. Let it be know that I love blue cheese, and a little goes a long way with said ingredient; it's a strong flavor. This, however, tasted more like a bland rue. The pasta itself was stuck together in clumps, which made me wonder how it was prepared...pasta doesn't do that in a saut\u00e9 pan.  It was thoroughly underwhelming. \n\n    It's also worth mentioning the staff...or at least one bartender.  My gent was fine. He seemed to have a little trouble getting around, but was courteous enough, and managed my order with no issues. There was another, much ruder, gent who spent the evening - or at least the time that I was there - trying to recruit customers into belittling the other bartender (the one serving me). \"Can you believe he has a degree in music?!?!...in MUSIC?\", he asked me with his absurd Thomas Shelby haircut and manicured beard. \"Who does that?!?\", he continued in his effort to impress himself. I absolutely did not take the bait; nor did most of the other customers, in what I can only expect was everyone trying to extend common kindness to a man just trying to do his job. \n\n     Let's have a reality check here. 1. Publicly belittling others lacks both character and professionalism. Full stop. 2. I have a degree in music, and what has been (so far, thanks be to God) a lasting & rewarding career in the Arts. So, what was meant only as unnecessary posturing between staff members, deeply offended your clientele. I chose not to engage the argument, because that is in no way what I'm looking for in a dinning experience...an argument with an arrogant, yet poorly-informed bartender. The phrase \"service industry\" springs to mind...SERVICE...since we like to repeat ourselves. In conclusion, the food was edible but not good; yet it was the utter pretension of Mr. Shelby which will ensure that I will neither spend another singular dollar, nor recommend Bar One to any of my friends or readers. #Service", "date": "2019-11-16 18:08:40"}, {"_key": "5286688", "_id": "reviews/5286688", "_rev": "_fNzF4ui--G", "review_id": "wlcG0zB_9R04V5EFXEEQjQ", "user_id": "XBeEmeV16yfP9EXLiqkRhQ", "business_id": "QdN72BWoyFypdGJhhI5r7g", "stars": 4, "useful": 5, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "text": "Vaguely remember coming here when the bar went by a different name, but glad to see it now operating as a solid happy hour spot.

I prefer steak fries, I like girth ( ...that's what she said!) \n\nUpon being sat, the song \" Cheeseburger in Paradise\" by Jimmy Buffett, was playing over their stereo system. I had a brief but rational worry that this song would be played on a loop as I ate. Thankfully, it wasn't nor were we subjected to JBs entire catalog but the CIP song was peppered liberally in the song rotation , so that we heard it at least 3 times while dining. \n\nThe tikibar decor was cool but not terribly impressive. The service was very good, although it was pretty dead even for a Monday night. My son loved the paper umbrella that came with his kids drink and I could tell that his older sister, who proudly orders drinks and entrees off the regular menu, was seething in jealousy yet too proud with her \"adult\" status to ask for one.. \n\nI didn't use the facilities but both offspring reported that they were \"freaked out\" by the peeping fish placed strategically in the bathrooms. We didn't get dessert but their Chocolate Nachos sounded intriguing , until I saw the faces of a couple nearby, who got the dish. It didn't look pretty. \n\nOverall, it was an average experience. I would not go out of my way to either return to CIP or to avoid it. When there are so many places to choose from, CIP needs to distinguish itself from all the other restraunt chains. My advice would be to \"beef\" up those titular average burgers and to get those rude fish out of the bathrooms, that like to watch people make toilet.", "date": "2009-08-19 18:25:47"}, {"_key": "4838064", "_id": "reviews/4838064", "_rev": "_fNzFdg2--X", "review_id": "yXv6HISKFtrC0nC9APCGVQ", "user_id": "590n3_2wj7xIPBzw8ogXTg", "business_id": "2xVsWBNFwZOxIOdd9Mwnww", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Great place.

The only caveat to this would be the environment which is a very \"child friendly\" restaurant where families seem to go out with other families while their children run around the restaurant creating chaos and ruiniing the experience for anyone trying to have an adult conversation.  Apparently the restaurant realizes this clientele base thus does nothing to curtail it so if you want some adult time, it might be better to go to another restaurant or go here later in the day.
