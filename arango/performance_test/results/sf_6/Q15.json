While the pizza holds the spotlight among the masses, I think that the star of the show goes to the smaller, non-pizza plates.\n\nMust get: judion beans, kale salad, classic pizza\nMeh: other specialty pizzas\nMissed out: other plates\n\nI cannot overstate how hard it was to get a reservation here at Pizzeria Beddia. This place used to be first come first serve, with lines that extend around the block. Since the new reservation system was installed, you have to book pretty much at midnight, 2 month before your planned dinner event in order to get a reasonable seat, otherwise all of the spots would be taken. While I am no foreigner to reservations, I will say that the pizza was definitely over hyped. My favorite is still the classic with whole milk mozzarella - I think the flavors, texture and even the crust was done just write. Every other speciality pizza had either too little topping, too greasy or just too wet.\n\nHowever, I must say that the biggest regret was not trying more plates. I loved the kale salad and the judion beans (melted like butter). The flavors, presentation and price point was just right. \n\nOverall, I think this is a nice pizza place, but to wait 2 month for a reservation was too much and I can think of plenty of other places worth exploring.\n\nFood: 3-4 stars\nService: 4 stars\nPrice: 3 stars\nAmbiance: 4 stars (the street is kind of a narrow one way street, in case you're ubering)", "date": "2019-07-12 17:05:54"}, {"_key": "10000026", "_id": "reviews/10000026", "_rev": "_fNzDwFW--B", "review_id": "q4BHxScj007cYUrY1kIWNg", "user_id": "7woBop5vY5hV4VLbKy7ZeA", "business_id": "bPVPZeqMuYtU_yGCb4P-jg", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Got into town late, the night before a conference.  We were hungry and road-weary, and the khao soi at this place fixed us right up.\n\nThe facility is very cool- an upscale food court perfect for casual nights out.

But this isn't a review of the Santa Barbara Public Market . . . just know that it's lovely.\n\nBack to my bowl of comfy goodness, though.  Warm, silky, flavorful, and slightly spicy (they're willing to kick it up a notch if you want, but I wasn't up to the challenge that night).  A creamy, happy curry noodle soup.  The only thing I might change is the chicken.  It was a teeny-tiny bit overcooked, and more strangely, left in a big chunk in the bowl.  That kinda interrupted my flow, until I got aggressive and just shredded the chicken myself.  Then I was able to get down to business.\n\nMy friend ordered her dish gluten-free, which was great.\n\nThe young lady who helped us was absolutely delightful- even though it was quite near the end of the night, she was cheerful, patient, and did everything she could to accommodate our weirdo requests.\n\nWe didn't sit at the counter, because it was packed full of people.

Pat's is the standard by which all other cheesesteaks should be held. And it is the best place for every \"beginner\" to start. You will probably find better steaks in other places in the city, but this one is guaranteed to still be damn good and give you a starting point for what to expect when you're talking cheesesteak.\n\n\"Whiz wit\" is the only way to go. Actually, scratch that; I have never tried American at Pat's (so I can't say for sure), but whiz is so much better than provolone, that I cannot imagine a better alternative. But in my opinion, no matter what, you HAVE to get it \"wit\" onions. Delicious.\n\nNot only does the STYLE of the cheesesteak at Pat's create an important compass for the cheesesteak virgin, but it also is the process of ordering that is a necessary experience. The workers are still the real deal, unphased by hype or tourism. They're just there to crank out the steaks.\n\nMy biggest \"dropped star\" in this review is the price. I don't MIND paying $9.50 for a cheesesteak, but maybe because just a couple days before, I got a better cheesesteak for almost half the price, I have become slightly embittered. It's not that I don't love Pat's, or that I can't pay the price, I just can't see myself needing to come back here again after finding more fortunate chartered waters elsewhere. \nBut I can't imagine a more deserving place for me to write my 100th Yelp review.\n\nThank you Pat's.

Just for a little while, everyone loved each other, the stars aligned and we were happy.\n\nWe started with the eggplant fries and OMG - smelling them cooking set the stage for the enjoyment to come.  Delicate breading, perfectly seasoned and not at all greasy, this is the way eggplant is meant to be cooked.  The marinara is clearly homemade - visible chunks of tomato and spices made for a perfect complement.\n\nWe sampled everyone's favorite sides - macaroni and cheese was creamy rich with a mix of cheeses that made me moan; potato salad and cole slaw were homemade and some of the best - and most different - you'll ever have.  No store-bought sides here - these were homemade and AMAZING.  \n\nAnd finally - the chicken ... it delivered on the promise of flavorful, tender, juicy and not even a little bit greasy.  I don't know how they do it - the flavor permeated the entire piece of chicken, it was just heavenly.\n\nThis is a don't miss place - and yes, I know in NOLA there are places like this all over, but this one is a \"can't miss.\"  We will be back - even if it's out of the way.\n\nOH and Marilyn gave us great places to shop and browse and other places to eat as well.

It was really nice to back to. The front staff is ok, not the friendliest this time around but definitely cordial enough. The breakfast was better than 3 yrs ago where there were huge lines for the hot breakfast and omelette line. oh yes this hotel does force everyone to go through their hot line if they want even bacon and sausages. So beware of that. So many days my teens who wake up late would op for the usual eggs and biscuits outside of the line. Weekday mornings weren't bad at all this time around. But Fri and Sat breakfast did get packed but the line moved quickly enough and loved how they open pretty late for weekend breakfasts. There was a NCAA BB tourney and many reunions that weekend so it was a busy hotel and some people stayed up way past 2am and laughed and talked all night long in the lobby which echoed all the way up the hotel.

Yet another restaurant that makes you enter in or near the smoking \"section\" (in quotes, since the smoke doesn't really stay in its own section. Restaurants, if you're reading this, THIS IS A BAD THING.). The hostess seated us without much pleasantry, and we were left waiting for menus for a bit. The restaurant was pretty empty in the \"non-smoking section\" (again, quotes used purposefully) -- only three other tables were full. That made the already-large room feel cavernous.\n\nOur server, who was nice enough, finally brought us menus, and we started looking. It didn't take us long to choose our food, but it did take a while before we could order it, as our server disappeared for a while. Eventually we ordered, and then our server brought bread to us. This was pretty plain bread -- basic baguette served with cold, hard individual butter. \n\nSoon after that, our salads arrived. We ordered basic side salads, nothing special. That's pretty much what we received, though I liked the basic vinegarette well enough, and it was cute that the salad bowl and plate were dusted with some kind of herb. Unfortunately, the salads were the best parts of our meals.\n\nRoughly 40 minutes passed between the time we ordered our entrees and time time said entrees arrived, which we didn't understand, considering how few people were dining that night. \n\nI ordered the cauliflower schnitzel, which tasted good at first bite, but then it just started tasting... odd. Heavy. Indescribable. I couldn't quite tell that it was cauliflower inside. My boyfriend thought he detected a vinegar taste, but I couldn't, really. The two large slabs of schnitzel were served with a side of spaghetti marinara, which wasn't memorable. I ate less than half my dinner and didn't box up the rest.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the veal wienver schnitzel, which also came in large, breaded, fried slabs. He opted for pasta with white sauce as his side, and though I couldn't try his items (I'm veggie), he didn't find anything remarkable about them.\n\nBaklava and other desserts were on the menu, but we were just done with the place by that point.

Animals enthusiasts all know that elephants are very social animals that thrive on companionships with their own kind. It's a bit disappointing to see her living in the habitat alone. However, I do understand that a major process would have to ensue should they decide to move another elephant in or move her out. It isn't so much at the discretion of the zoo as much as it is the AZA and SSP. I applaud the efforts of the elephant keepers to keep this beauty active, happy, and engaged though.

He said he didn't taste the fruityness of it, but that it was tasty none the less. \n\nWe started our meal with the chicken lollipops and they were just as flavourful as I remember them being. A hint of spice in the sauce that made them sing on the tongue. The slaw that they nested on was made of apples, cabbage and other thinly sliced vegetables, which added to the crunch and made it heavenly!\n\nOur mains were very diversive: I chose the steak and since it was lunch it was only $15 for an 8 oz portion, atop a large mound cheddar mashed potatoes and the vegetable of the day (grilled asparagus) and a garnish of popcorn (I admit, I was confused) The meat was absolutely delicious, tender and grilled to perfection.

Anywhere I travel -  I must visit their Costco.  My dream job would be to travel the world - go to Costco's and review their food courts and designer products.

They have awesome staff - especially this AMAZING asian dude in electronics (I can't remember his name... Grr... I'll have to update this later...) but he's funny and hillarious and knows his stuff!  He's a big guy - 6 feet tall and the BEST!  \n\nWhen in Vancouver - you must have teriyaki at their food court.  When in Seattle - you must have lattes and mochas and cappaccinos and real fruit smoothies!  Did you know that they don't serve french fries in the states at Costco?  Yep, that's totally a Canadian thing!  (Just like Taco Bell and KFC don't serve french fries in the states, either).\n\nThe best thing about our Costco food court here - is the root beer floats! Root beer floats you say?  That's right, I said root beer floats!  You see this is how it goes... My hubby orders a hot dog and gets the free cup for pop with unlimited refills and I order vanilla ice cream in a cup instead of a cone.  Naturally, I snag his pop cup - fill it 2/3 with rootbeer than put in vanilla ice cream!  And the beauty of it is - you still have enough ice cream for another rootbeer float or a coke float or an orange float - Yes, yes... this is heaven!\n\nAnd POUTINE - my God!  What do they do to their heavenly fries - it's almost like their battered in some sort of  golden crispy rain from heaven then covered in fresh cheese and smothered in gravy goodness... Riddle me this: \n\nWhere else can you order a hot dog and pop, poutine, and have 2 rootbeer floats for under $10?!?\n\nI know, I know... I sound like I've completely gone off the deep end... and I have... I'm in love with Costco.\n\nIn New York - the Costco's are built up instead of out - so you shop multiple floors and they have a little magickal conveyer belt that take your cart up to the next floor for you!  \n\nI have discovered that I'm not alone... there are people out there that blog about Costco!  http://www.ilovecostco.com/\n\nSome of the best ones are the Asian blogs about Costco... They have the most unique products and food court items ever!\n\nAnd samples... it's like they know the key to my heart and how to get me to buy 400 pounds of something I don't need!\n\nTheir customer service is superb and I've only ever had one significant problem - which occurred at the West end location - and was later resolved after I had written two letters and spoken with two managers.  \n\nTheir return policy is the best in the universe!  Where else can you try out a digital camera or camcorder for 90 days before deciding to keep it or not?  \n\nI could go on and on...\n\nMy heart belongs to Costco...\n\n(Okay for the sake of being objective - my one and only complaint is that the Costco's here are so much smaller than the ones I grew up with in Washington.  In Washington they have a wine steward that will give you suggestions of wine for your meal... they have 4-6 aisles of stationary - that's right nerds - I'm serious!  Aisles and aisles of pens and paper!  It's like you've died and gone to office supply heaven!  And they even have a Business center that specializes in office supplies, and refurbished computers at Costco prices!!! And the clothing!  We're talking 40-60 tables of clothing with brand names like Seven, Ralph Lauren, etc.)  \n\nSo the next time you're travelling the world and thinking of places to visit - hit up Costco!

BUT for Valentine's Day I made an exception for my husband, as he is always down for Latin food: arroz con carne y tajadas.  Knowing it was Valentine's - I went fully prepared to wait for our food & drinks and be patient.  The universe had other plans for us, hence the 5 stars.  I love sharing food and I know latin restaurants serve plenty, so we ordered the tamal (classic one) de puerco o carne (cant remember lol), the empanada trio and the maduros con bacon and cotija cheese....my husband then ordered the ropa vieja as his entre and when I asked for a quesadilla the lovely honest lady said that was a LOT OF FOOD, so I cancelled it immediately.  There is nothing more I appreciate than a server honestly telling you: YOU ARE ORDERING TOO MUCH food instead of letting you pay more for more tip (I obviously tipped her well AND in cash for her service).  The 3 appetizers were perfect for 2 hungry peeps or 3 not so hungry girls! The ropa vieja ended up in a to go box before it came to the table and dessert was tres leches which was amazing!!!! Last but not least I ordered the peach cilantro frozen margarita - which was SO fresh and SO good. I truly am happy they had outside seating for a last minute Valentine's date as I will def be back for drinks and bites with friends SOON!!!!!

Not sure why review was so low here. Went here a few days ago on a Wednesday to use our groupon. Of course being downtown its hard to find parking, but good thing we found parking near the streets near monument circle for FREE! BLT is in between Qdobos and Jimmy Johns and there is a hostess outside to direct you it is downstairs. Looks like its in a basement. I really dig the decor. One thing I didnt like, I didnt like the music. I am all for hip hop, but the music felt like it was a club going on. It was a weekday so i didn't think the club music was necessary. We were seated right away and we were able to use the $30 groupon on anything wanted. It was very hard to choose, not sure if it was over or underwhelming menu, but we really couldn't decide. I think I was expecting a full menu of entrees like steak and pasta but I take that there menu is like bar type food. I ordered a pork tenderloin sandwich and my boyfriend got meatloaf. Food came soooo quick! Now that's service.Tenderloin sandwich was huge!! I couldn't even finish it, i ate only half. It was good. I really enjoyed the fries that went with it. The meatloaf is ok, maybe because I am not a meatloaf fan. But I guess that's what you order when you cant decide. To me it tasted kind of try, but again I don't know how meatloaf tastes like. My boyfriend seem to enjoyed it. Also the sangria i order was the special white sangria, it was strong but I don't know why the call it white for it was more pink. Maybe because they use fruit so the infusion of it made it change color. I enjoyed the sangria, it was strong and not so sweet just the way I like it. Got our check and noticed they gave us only $27 dollar discount for groupon instead of $30, but Heather our waitress went ahead and fixed that right up. I think this place is perfect for a place to kick back and chill and have a few drinks and appetizers. I would be back for a random chill night if the music was different. I hope this place does very well, because when we were there, it was not busy at all.

There was the perfect amount of pasta and chicken ( not overrun with carbs and underwhelmed by the small amount of chicken).

They didn't have any names for the pastries, or descriptions, so I had to ask one of the staffers to name and briefly describe each one before I could make my selection.

The least expensive entree is the chicken teriyaki at $22.  Most items were in the $36-$65 range.  With drinks, this is not a cheap place!  The atmosphere is very noisy and I found it very hard to hear the waitress and our chef.  The chef had such corny jokes- it's probably better that I couldn't hear.  The chef has been with the restaurant approximately a year and could still use some work on his skills as he dropped the rice bowls a few times and while blindfolded, tried to divide three cut-up breasts of chicken between three plates and one plate ended up with only 4 pieces while the rest had 10-15.  He ended up comping a extra breast of teriyaki chicken from the kitchen.  Fried rice was made at the table for those who had ordered it and when there had been a bit left over (even though some of it ended up on the floor, as I said) he gave everyone a chance to try it.  It was delicious.   After dinner, we enjoyed a scoop of ice cream.  I had green tea, a taste that I  love but find difficult to describe.  They readily agreed to split the bills between groups at the table and worked with us without problem when some of the charges got mixed-up.  I couldn't give it any higher than three stars because the only thing I really liked was the fried rice and the ice cream (which probably came from elsewhere).

He'd read about how good this place was, but would soon learn that no matter how good he thought it would be, it was better....it was SOOOOO GOOD! I'd read this may be the best smelling restaurant in America due to the perpetual flow of pita from their brick oven and boy howdy, they were correct!\n\nWe came on over for dinner around 6 on a random Thursday. Call ahead if you don't have a reservation as this place fills up quick. For those of us who don't think far enough ahead to get a spot inside, they have outdoor and bar seating. We sat in the courtyard and it was perfect. No direct sun in the evening and a very nice vibe, very chill vibe. \n\nOur waitress was lovely and had great insight into just about everything on the menu. The wine list was solid, the beer selection good and the cocktails were divine. There were a dozen or so on the menu and I think we tried 9 of them. All were great!\n\nThe pitas that they served here are EPIC! Pillowy and puffed up while hot and just plain delicious. I think the end of rainbows may actually end up here rather than a pot of gold. I don't know if Israeli folklore goes that direction, but perhaps it should - they're that good! \n\nThe sharing items were 5 of $23 and were perfect for the group. We ordered the Baba ganoush, Pickled Ramps (Feta w/ olive oil), Ikra, Moraccan Arots and the wood roasted okra - The Ikra and the okra were two of the best dishes I've ever had. Ikra was paddlefish caviar w/ shallots and a creamy/savory past as a base. The okra had tomato, tahini and duqqa - I'm not sure what duqqa is, but it was amazing! It was the sort of stuff you chew longer because it's so good and then order more bread so you can clean the plates with it!\n\nThe curried fried cauliflower hummus as incredible too. Foods I wouldn't have thought to put together that compliment each other so well, it was like they were made for one another. The cauliflower was lightly crispy with just a bit of char and oh so much flavor. It was like a party in my mouth where the guest of honor had recently traveled to both India and Israel.\n\nFour of us shared the aforementioned hummus and table dips, as well as the avocado toast, shakshouka, foie gras and the kibbeh nayah. The avocado toast was AWESOME. Rye bread base, a layer of smoked whitefish and tons of avocado topped w/ peppercorns - Again, mouth party. The shakshouka was very flavorful and also required additional pita to completely clear the plate. The foie gras was far and away the best I've ever tasted. Just enough char with a bit of sweet from the molasses - absolutely heavenly. The crown jewel however, was the kibbeh nayah - beef and lamb tartare with a piece of fried flatbread. This was one of the top 2 or 3 things I've had in the last 5 years. An absolute flavor explosion that danced in my mouth with the chewy, warm, carbiness of the flatbread. If we'd only ordered that, I would have walked away happy.\n\nAs we ate enough for a small village, we opted out of dessert, but many looked very appetizing. \n\nAll in all, the powers that be that talked about what a gem this place is are spot on.

Hit it in the summertime--I think they have the BEST patio (not to mention a RIVERSIDE patio) in all of Boise. With great food, fun drinks, an an atmosphere that's always \"on,\" it's just hard to beat... except for maybe that it's downtown. But hey, then there's the Ram--saving the day yet again--with the introduction of their Meridian location. Win, win, win.\n\nFood: I love the food at The Ram. Their nachos are sky high (so is the mile high mud pie!) and so good. They have daily soups that are always thick and hearty. Their burgers are also always really well-cooked and taste great. My husband often orders the wings, while I usually get the salads or something from their lighter fare menu. The armadillo eggs are really tasty as well! Honestly, the food is hard to beat. If you're a mac and cheese fan, give it a shot. It's very rich and creamy, so bring a hearty appetite. If you like chips & salsa, ask for it! It's not on the menu but they'll bring it right out!\n\nDrinks: From their house-brewed beers to their crafted cocktails, there is no shortage of drinks. I really like their \"skinny\" drink menu, and think the lemon drop is great. Don't be surprised if you get a loaded toothpick of olives if you ask for a dirty martini. This place knows how to hook it up! Also, for the non-drinkers, their hot chocolate is excellent.\n\nAtmosphere: I LOVE the atmosphere at The Ram. It has a great bar area and is very good for watching sports, no matter where you're sitting in the restaurant. The tables are well spaced, the lighting is dim and elegant, and the volume is loud but fun. I like how they have a good mix of booths and tables and have the ability to accommodate large parties.\n\nService: Always fast and reliable. Nicolette in the bar is our favorite!\n\nHappy Hour Offerings: Daily food and drink specials. Well drinks, beers and 6 oz wine pours for just $3.50? Now that's awesome. They also have a good food happy hour menu with some of their most popular items for super-cheap prices.\n\nHealthy Hack: I almost always order from the gluten free or lighter fare menu. I usually get the blackened salmon with two sides of steamed veggies, opting to leave the quinoa off my plate. You can also try the soups, which are nice and hearty but low on cals. I feel like The Ram offers a very diverse menu for clean and/or picky eaters.\n\nTips: If you like chips & salsa, ask for it!

Considering we're locals and eat out every chance we get, we couldn't believe that we've never been there!\n\nSue Zemanick is the chef of Gautreau's and you might recognize her from shows like Top Chef Masters and Knife Fight. With her growing popularity, I was really interested in what the restaurant had to offer...\n\nThe restaurant is quite small and the waiting area is very limited, but I found it to be quite intimate. As for the food, there was a great amount of detail and thought to each dish. We ordered the chilled lobster appetizer which was amazing! There were so many levels of flavors and it was so refreshing. I owe it to the light touch of passionfruit, grapefruit aioli, avocado, and heck...every element was SO good. The Foie Gras was paired well with a cherry reduction, a nice touch. The sweetbread dish was good, but were quite small. I would have preferred them bit chunkier, but the flavors were there. There's nothing like a mouthful of ouffel (ironically, pronounced awful)!\n\nOne of my favorite dishes was the Special Quail Salad of the day. The fried quail ate like a perfect crispy fried chicken and was balanced so well with a bed of salad. Lastly, was the Pork Osso Buco. It's rare to find a Pork Osso Buco so we couldn't help but order it. It's not as moist as Veal Osso Buco, but still very delicious! I love the thin and delicate tagliatelle that came with the dish.

I don't understand how it's possible.\n\nThe service here has always been incredible - I've had the same waiter almost every time (he is tall and has blonde curly hair). He's so incredibly nice and so attentive. They also always do such a good job of coursing the tapas out.\n\nDrinks wise, Meril is home to my favorite cocktail in all of New Orleans - the number 52. It's a bourbon based drink, but even some non-bourbon drinkers I've been with have liked it. I actually bought all the ingredients to make it myself, but that went really poorly for me. I will leave the cocktail making up to the professionals.

The Rock Shrimp Tacos are my JAM.

At one point, this review could have been 5 stars. Some of my experiences have been 1 to 2 stars. They honestly lack consistency. I have been here about 6-7 times now and I have learned what I like and what I don't. I also have learned some of their downfalls.\n\nFirst of all, the pricing is much higher than I would like. I can have bbq that I like slightly more at a handful of restaurants for several dollars cheaper per meal. The burnt ends are one of my favorite items, but they cost even more than most the meats. The Brontosaurus rib always has me drooling, but I cannot justify the cost to try it. The pulled pork is decent, but nothing special. It sometimes has hard, overcooked pieces. The jalapeno cheddar sausage is flavorful and delicious when it is not overcooked (which is hit or miss). I wasn't impressed with the chicken the one time I ordered it. \n\nTheir sides are weird. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but you cannot be prepared for traditional sides going into Dr. BBQ. I try to keep my sugar and carbs low, so I mostly order the collard greens, blue cheese slaw, and gin salad. The collard greens are bland and lacking flavor. The blue cheese slaw is delicious, but can be overwhelming with the amount of blue cheese that they sometimes use. The gin salad is good, but simple. It is essentially cucumbers, tomatoes, and red onions in a vinaigrette. \n\nThe Holy Grail at Dr. BBQ and the reason that I return again and again are their pulled pork nachos (Q the nachos). They consist of pork rinds (house made I believe) that are covered in a spicy queso, sour cream, pulled pork, and pickled red onions. It sounds simple, but this dish is so well executed that you will crave it until you can come back. This is why I come. I have recently started ordering the pulled pork nachos as my entree since it is half the price of the meals and more satisfying. I save a lot of money this way. They also have a delicious (although sugary) bacon appetizer. \n\nThe atmosphere is very unique here. It can be a little loud for my liking at times though. It is a huge two story warehouse with an outdoor porch. There are little niches within the restaurant. They definitely spent some money on decor. \n\nService is also hit or miss. There is one male server in particular that we have had upstairs that has twice \"forgot\" to put our order in. Typically when you are at Dr. BBQ, your order arrives very quickly. Most of the food is made already and dispensed to order. We have waited over an hour on multiple occasions. The rest of our servers though have been really amazing. Again, inconsistent. \n\nI will be back for the pork nachos.

I forget what I had exactly because this is one of those reviews that I started weeks ago and forgot to finish, but it definitely had vegetables and goat cheese. Of this I am sure. It was a huge portion, but the amount of goat cheese in the dish itself was lacking. The rosemary potatoes were good, although something missing from those too. I think it may be the lack of salt. But again, I apparently love high cholesterol and over-salt things as well. They have home-made ketchup as well and it's served in a super pretty frosted vase-looking container, but I wasn't a fan.

I'd heard the French toast was pretty good here so I figured we'd both order it since Sean LOVES French toast and I hadn't had it at a restaurant in a while.\n\nWell we walked up to the counter and saw that the only kind they had was made with some type of fruit and nut bread. That was an immediate \"no\" for Sean since he hates it when people put shit in bread like fruit or whatever, and he hates walnuts too so yeah. No dice. He went with the plain pancakes instead. When I'd asked the girl at the counter if it was possible to make the French toast with plain or wheat bread instead she was almost to the point of being rude about it. \"No, we only have this type of bread. It's how we do it here. It isn't going to change.\" Jesus effing Christ, lady, have some tact when you're talking to customers. Seriously. I really don't understand why in the actual crap they couldn't just reach for some white bread instead of tutti frutti nutty explosion bread. But yeah. Needless to say I threw in the towel and went with the standard fruit explosion thing. Hey, maybe it might be good? I mean sometimes I will order something when I'm out and about that sounds kind of a weird combo but then it turns out being great. So yeah, why not? I mean, at least it wasn't RAISIN bread. *shivers*\n\nI also ordered fresh squeezed orange juice and some eggs. Sean had a side of bacon. The bacon was actually cheaper than the eggs which baffled the living crap out of me. How in the hell is bacon cheaper than eggs? If you go to a grocery store and do the math, one egg costs something crazy like $0.19. Why Winslow's charges $4.50 for a side of eggs is beyond me. Hell, why they charge a total of $13 for an order of French toast and an order of plain pancakes is also beyond me. Sean informed me that it was the location and they could could charge about $15 for a plate of pancakes by itself if they wanted to and stupid rich hippies would still pay for it. Yeah.\n\nIt took about 15 minutes or so plus or minus for us to get our food. The fresh squeezed OJ tasted foul. It was by far the WORST fresh squeezed OJ I'd ever tasted in my life. It was wayyyy too sour with a hint of BITTER, even! It tasted like they tried to squeeze oranges that weren't even ripe yet. Ick. It gave me a stomach ache. The French toast was also really really disgusting. Fruit and nut bread drenched in fruit syrup covered in fruit? Way too much fruit in that dish. If it had been made of PLAIN bread it would have been thousands of times better and I would have actually enjoyed it. The inside was sort of raw, even, like they just didn't cook it long enough. It was kind of gelatinous, ick. The eggs were warm in some spots and cold in others. The bacon was alright but nothing special. At least it looked like they cooked it long enough. Our entire meal was about $24.00 total which was ridiculous. We did get sufficiently full from eating it, but I could also go to Uncle Bill's and get the same amount of food if not more for a fraction of the cost. The icing on the cake was two soccer moms sitting a few feet away from us (tables are pretty jam packed because of all the crap they have for sale taking up space) incessantly bitching about stupid shit. It was enough to make my stomach ache from the bitter OJ turn into full-blown indigestion. \n\nOh and the store. Pretty abominable.

It's like the designers of these places think that Reno is no different from Vegas...don't they know what the weather is like here?

The patio was gorgeous and most tables had views, although we were unfortunately seated behind this giant pillar that didn't allow for views of anything. Between the two of us, we got the soup of the day, two full entrees, 3 drinks, and dessert. The bill came to $80 including tip. Not bad for a fancy, celebratory dinner.\n\nThe reason this review is 3 stars is some things were amazing, and some things were a bit off. For instance, we ordered the chicken and the salmon entrees, where the meats were absolutely perfect and the sides were a little off. The roast chicken itself was incredible - extremely tender meat topped with crispy skin. I was in heaven! The entree came with \"crispy white cheddar grits\", which turned out to be grits patties that tasted rather salty and bland. The same went for the salmon entree - the salmon was so delicious but the hash soaked in a cider sauce was a bit too apple'y and overwhelming. Granted, we probably messed with the chef's vision, as the hash involved sweet potato, but since we aren't crazy about sweet potatoes, we asked if we could sub the sweet potatoes for normal potatoes. The waiter said that wasn't an option and suggested white rice instead, which seemed kind of strange. So we asked for no sweet potato hash at all, and perhaps some fries instead. I guess there was some miscommunication since we got the hash, where the sweet potatoes were substituted with zucchini (which we're also not crazy about) and we were given a giant side of fries, which we had to pay for. It wasn't a big deal but it's a little frustrating when our needs seem simple and it's difficult to communicate that to the kitchen and wait staff.\n\nThe entree portions were huge, and we had leftovers so we were happy about that!\n\nThe soup of the day (french onion) and the dessert (triple decker cookie layered with peanut butter ice cream) were amazing. The waiter was nice and tried his best, I think maybe there was nervousness or maybe he just needs more experience. \n\nEven though 3 stars looks harsh, it equates to \"A-OK\", which is what I think Commoner & Co is. Perhaps my expectations were soaring, given my undying love for Prep & Pastry, and it didn't quite meet those expectations.

We ordered a Carne Asada caramelo which is basically a steak quesadilla, a Sonoran hot dog, and guacamole with chips. I've never had an authentic Sonoran dog--it was really good! I never thought to put so many different ingredients on a hot dog but it definitely works! The Carne Asada caramelo was by far the best item we got. Their guacamole dip had cheese and tomatoes all throughout and it was good, but way better with the spicy pico de gallo. I put that on everything!

I was craving something sweet and figured it would be a good chance for Sean H. to check this place out too. He gave it a thumbs up, even though all he got was mint choco chip ice cream to go. I don't think the ice cream is local, but that's OK because it's still tasty. The owners were out at the Taste of St. Chuck so one of their friends was running the place and he only had a few answers to my (plethora) of questions.\n\nAnyway! I decided to get some things to go. I got mint ice cream to go, a piece of their choco chip gooey butter cake, and one of their brownies. All of the baked goods are made in house, which rocks my socks. Also their antique soda fountain and some fixtures from another old soda shop that closed down and relocated to Main Street also rocks my socks.\n\nBut what rocked my mouth, was their gooey butter cake. Now, if you're a local from the area, you MAY NOT like their interpretation of gooey butter cake. Theirs is made from what appeared to be a base of BREAD. As in, it's two-layers, and the first layer is bread. Which rocks for me because I am always bitching about how I can't stand how freakin' sweet gooey butter cake is. It's like, a sugary sensory overload, and oftentimes unbearable even for me, the sweet-tooth monster. So this is essentially an answer to my prayers. The chocolate chips gave an otherwise plain gooey butter cake a nice balance. The bread layer seemed a little dried out, though, so I would be cautious of that. They might want to get some airtight containers for storage if they don't already, or just bake more fresh daily if they don't already. I don't know. That's the problem I have with homemade bread (assuming this is homemade too) because while store-bought bread does not taste anywhere near as good as homemade, it definitely lasts longer....ah the magic of gross-tasting preservatives! Their bread didn't taste gross though, and it was a nice balance for the sugary-overload of a top layer. ;)\n\nBut yeah.... two thumbs up on the gooey butter cake. I want to try their other flavors now! It's so freakin' good. Definitely cravable. The brownie was great too, although way more sugary but had more of the choconess I was craving (yep, it's that super happy magical fun time of the month!) hehe.

Stephanie B had never been so I was excited to show her this gem that we have out here. We arrived and made our way to the line for apple and pumpkin picking. We took the customary tractor ride out to the orchard and began our search for the perfect apples to bring home. One of the best things is being able to pull an apple off the tree and eat it. There is something cool about being able to eat a piece of fruit that you have just plucked off a tree. \n\nAfter we had picked as many apples as we wanted, we made our way out into he pumpkin patch.

When we arrived back at the store, we paid for our pumpkins and apples and made our way to the car to store our goods. \n\nI was surprised and glad to see that since my last visit, which was sometime last fall, they built a new Country Store. This is much welcomed as the old store was a bit on the small side and felt cramped at times. The new store is larger, but still has that small town store feel and is great.

We had a delicious spread with rich, sultry sauces and lovely light (not overcooked - how refreshing!!!) white fish dish, shrimp prawns, as well as a variety of quiches and salad. Also the light fruit dishes with a drop of sorbet was fantastic! I enjoyed every single bite and sip- as did all of our guests. They were truly a 'crowd pleasing' operation- set up and cleaned up without the slightest incident. I am so grateful for how well you took care of us and how spectacular our event was. You were so accommodating even when I was in search of a fork at the end of the event for my 6 year old nephew.

It's located on Eagle Creek Reservoir, the closest thing to a body of water in Indianapolis.  I'm told it's man made, but hrmph, details.  The outdoor patio is HUGE and extends over the water, with a big bar and tons of tables with great views of the water and boats, and if you go at dusk, a great view of the sunset.  We were there in time to see the sunset, but it was a bit too chilly and windy to sit outside (in August--shocking!), so we snagged a table inside right by the window, which was almost as great.  There was a live band playing some jazzy background music, and the atmopshere was just fabulous.  Festive, fun, but laid back all at once.\n\nAs for the food -- solid.  We had been doing a lot of eating the previous two days, so we chose lighter fare.  I would certainly return to try a seafood entree, they all sounded delish.  We started with cups of the seafood chowder, which was fantastic, but would have been better served sightly hotter.  Flavorful and lots of big hunks of fishy and potato-y goodness.  \n\nFor my main meal I had the summer goat cheese salad, which was mixed greens with prosciutto and strawberries (fantastic salty-sweet combo by the way) and two generous sized pistachio encrusted sauteed goat cheese  squares on top.  Dressed in balsamic vinagrette, it was the perfect light meal with hints of richness.  Nick had a wood-fired pizza (individual sized, but still -- large) with sausage and pepperoni.  I had a bite, and it was decent, but nothing to write home about.  Grandma had the cobb salad, which should have been called \"southwestern cobb\" or something because it was spicy!  I don't recall it saying that on the menu.  Good thing she likes spicy.  Nonetheless it was tasty, very fresh ingredients.\n\nThe menu is huge, and I'm afraid our selections did not do it justice.  We enjoyed our food very much, and I want to give it five stars, but I think I'd have to return.  Like I said, I'd return for a seafood entree or maybe a steak. It's a wee bit on the pricey side for Indy (more like Chicago prices), but I guess you're paying for the atmosphere.  I would certainly return, and if I were entertaining a guest in Indy, I would certainly bring them here.  Service was attentive but a little...strange.  At one point he called my grandmother \"my love.\"  As in, \"yes, I'll get you a box for that salad, my love.\" ????\n\nFantastic, unique dining experience in Indianapolis.

If it weren't for Neo of Malaka across town, I would say that Om is the best place to get Southeast Asian cuisine in Tucson, hands down.  And since Neo of Malaka is owned by the same family, I don't think the parity between the two restaurants will be furrowing many brows.\n\nThe dinner menu here is an embarrassment of riches.  Would you like a top-quality Thai curry?  You may not have known that there was a way to get good Thai food in Tucson, but as it turns out, Om's is excellent.  Or maybe you're in the mood for something lighter -- a Vietnamese bun salad?  In spite of the wide range of Vietnamese choices in Tucson, Om's bun is among the best I've had.  Chinese food is well represented as well -- not the Americanized nonsense you'll find in Chinese restaurants across town, but actual Chinese classics like spicy Dan Dan noodles and re-imagined treats like their barbecued pork sliders.  And don't forget about the excellent Malaysian dishes!\n\nOf course, that's not even mentioning the sushi.  Om's baked scallops are the best in town, and the ginger ponzu sauce that comes with the Honda roll will immediately become a stopping-off point for every piece of sushi you eat for the rest of the night.  The seafood is all very fresh and the cuts are generous -- a combination that's hard to find in Tucson.  \n\nThe sushi menu also features a nice variety of spicy options, but my spice-aficionado girlfriend has found them to be a bit tame.  After talking some trash to chef Allen, we were presented with a spicy yellowtail roll featuring three chopped Thai chilis.  Several glasses of water and a few tears later, we were forced to admit that Om can bring the spice after all.  For spice-lovers, I would strongly recommend asking for one of those chilis chopped into a spicy yellowtail roll -- the flavor was really excellent, and with a bit less heat we thought it could be one of the better things on the menu.\n\nHave you gotten the idea yet?  Om is flippin' amazing, and I can't imagine how one could possibly fail to enjoy eating there.  Not only is the food incredible, but the staff is top-notch and Tina and Allen do an excellent job at making everyone feel welcome.  People with special dietary needs will also be happy to know that Om is very good at accommodating people -- my girlfriend can't have gluten, but between the Tamari soy sauce that's available on request and the wide range of gluten-free options on the menu, we have never had a hard time putting together an amazing meal for her, and the staff has been very sensitive about trying to limit the possibility of cross-contamination wherever they can.\n\nAaaaaaand now I am starving.

It was not bad getting into downtown and since it was Green Sunday and we had four people in the car we got to park for free. An added bonus. We parked in Lot 2 and it was right across the street from the exit. We got there early to check out the aquarium and touch some rays. It was a short wait as they allow 35 people in every 8 minutes. There is also a baseball museum there if you have time. Not sure about the whole carnival idea for kids. It was crazy crowded and loud. Lots of kids at this game since The Wiggles were having a concert after the game. \nWe are Oriole fans and love Camden Yards. It was great that we actually beat the Rays in ten innings. Everyone around us was friendly and since we were behind the O;s dugout there were several others dressed in orange.  I am not sure about the indoor thing but I am sure it has something to do with all the rain and lightning. I missed the flags flying and the sunshine. It was a totally different experience. The prices for food and beverages was about the same. A big all you can drink Pepsi for $9 but without the sun and the heat you really did not need to drink a lot. It's great you can bring in outside food. That is a no no in Baltimore. Lots of different concessions stands selling hotdogs, sausage, pulled pork the usual. We were looking for some good ole beef like at Boog's stand but had to settled for some nachos and sausage. Both were ok. They sell a huge baseball cap full of nachos with everything on them that would feed your whole group. \nThe best part of the whole day was that we caught a foul ball. SInce it was a Ray's player we gave it to the kid in front of us who was a Rays fan. All in all I would definitely go here again for a game when the O's come to town. The Rays' fans certainly are not as loud and crazy as the Yard but we had fun cheering the O;s to victory!", "date": "2012-08-09 15:58:39"}, {"_key": "10005341", "_id": "reviews/10005341", "_rev": "_fNzDxoS--_", "review_id": "2JRUhMOLonpw7X8l0LL6Kg", "user_id": "1De45K4AHpVTovLFlLwVlQ", "business_id": "sF7tzf4pw2xqJz05oWgFtA", "stars": 5, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "text": "How does this place only have 4 reviews?

Seats are close together and the place becomes extremely crowded during dinner. I think we waited about 40-50 minutes for two bowls of ramen. Ramen meat bowls will run you around $16-$18. However, the flavor of the ramen more than made up for it and we can not wait to go back. \n\nWe arrived at the door to be asked if we had reservations. Reservations for ramen? Seems a bit pretentious. The decor is nice. The floors seem to be leftover from the previous bar and can be a bit precarious...so be careful moving your chair. We were seated at a tiny table in between two other couples that were about 6 inches away in both directions. It makes it uncomfortable and awkward trying to get to the inner seat. The worst part about this however, was watching them eat their pipping hot bowls of ramen while we waited, and waited, and waited while starving. Our waiter was mostly absent. After checking my watch and realizing we had ordered 35 minutes prior, I locked eyes with him and was told ours was coming. \n\nWhen it did arrive, my pork belly ramen was AMAZING. The pork belly was like butter and super flavorful. I was a little worried to order pork belly at first because it can be fatty, it isn't an issue in this case. Do yourself a favor and order it. My Husband was disappointed in his meat in his $18 waygu beef ramen. It was overcooked and not sliced all the way through which made it hard to eat. Luckily, he loved the flavor of the broth. We both agreed that the pork belly was definitely the best option. \n\nIf you like spicy, ask for their house made chili sauce. It is incredibly flavorful. I poured the entire cup into my ramen and it made it perfectly spicy. The bathrooms are also really nice. They have full length mirrors and hand-towels. Also, you can drink water with your ramen to save some cash. The water bottles passed out are reused and filled in house with flat distilled water I believe. It tasted good, I just wish it was served with ice. \n\nOverall, we left full and happy with our meal. Service can improve, ice in the glasses would be nice and the price is a little steep. However, the food is amazing and worth the other inconveniences. We will return. \n\nPS- the table beside us had a waitress that actually seemed to know something about Buya and she told them the cocktails were created by the same guy that did the cocktails for The Mill and Edison. We didn't try them due to the price, but they might be worth the splurge.", "date": "2016-09-15 05:24:12"}, {"_key": "10005356", "_id": "reviews/10005356", "_rev": "_fNzDxoS--O", "review_id": "nbw4sW6zxxZmWr6LI7fI_g", "user_id": "w0W_hs1EX6x7XuZsEkHDDQ", "business_id": "-xaY1TlMf20Ol9QLcDSU6Q", "stars": 3, "useful": 4, "funny": 2, "cool": 4, "text": "I love markets.

But there was a big difference between this tart and all of the others on this challenge.\n\nIn am attempt to counteract the blood sugar high, we got a few protein dishes.\n\nThe Chicken Sticky rice was served warm and we loved it! Great flavors and a better ratio of chicken to sticky rice. Still alot of rice, but the chicken was tender and flavorful.\n\nAlso, we got a Roast Pork Pie. Again, the carb to protein ratio was off.

They have 4 shared boards that include various meats, cheeses, etc. We tried the farm board, which had a little bit of everything. It's a bit pricey at $32 but there's more than enough food for an appetizer for 4 and it's great. I've also tried the lamb meatball appetizers and highly recommend them as well.\n\nAs for the entrees, I LOVE their burger.

I had seen Sandler's 4-star Yelp rating - in retrospect, I should have looked more closely at the actual reviews. I was intrigued with its historic, upscale and classy former Ben Franklin Hotel location (not to be confused with the Hotel Franklin on Independence Park).\n\nIt's rare that I give only 2 stars based on one visit, but in doing so I feel I'm being fairly generous.\n\nWe arrived early on a Tuesday evening for a 7:30 reservation, and stepping in the door, the live music (amplified blues guitarist and percussionist) was so loud that we immediately asked to be seated somewhere quieter. The host asked, \"What?\" because, of course, he couldn't hear us. That's when you know you're in trouble, and the instinct to leave was almost overwhelming. (Don't misunderstand, I love that music, and it was excellent - just way too loud - and the concrete floors don't help in that regard.) \n\nThe host showed us the seating in the hotel lobby, which was empty of diners, and it seemed like being on display for the building's tenants walking through. (It is indeed a huge, beautiful space - but the website description of the \"second bar and lounge in the lobby\" as being \"intimate\" seems like sheer puffery - and the host assured us that there wasn't a bar.) He then led us to a table in the far corner of the restaurant, which was still loud, but bearably so.\n\nOur server arrived promptly, but left us with only 1 food menu. No problem, we can share. \n\nAsking her to recommend the driest white wine on the list, her response, which admittedly was difficult to hear, seemed to be \"I only know the liquors.\" (Right, I'd stay on the hard stuff myself if I had an evening ahead of me shouting in that din.) The poor server, she seemed so forlorn and unhelpful, we could only feel sorry for her. But it really says something about the way the management trains the waitstaff, that they don't know anything about the white wines and don't have anyone to turn to for help, doesn't it?\n\nThe Ferrari-Carrano we selected (served in a single glass plastic carafe) really lacked character and was notable only for its sweetness. Just what we didn't want. A second order for a red wine was much better. Okay, one for one. (Of course, the server didn't have any comment or question about the fact that the white wine remained mostly untouched.)\n\nAt this point, not one to abandon all hope, I focused on the veggie burger - at the least, this \"local sourced\" and \"sustainable food\" business might have a great plant-based burger, perhaps a runner-up, if not a winner for my \"Search for the Greatest Veggie Burger\" collection. Nope. \n\nThis is an experience that I'm sure every vegetarian can relate to. That veggie burger, which always appears toward if not at the bottom of the meat burger list, shouts out that it's an afterthought - it's the obligatory \"we have to have a veggie burger for those people\" - even though the chef or owner would never want to eat such a thing. So it's the rather bland white bean-quinoa mush \"patty\" (two pieces of romaine on top) that   ends up being mostly extruded from the bun. Texture matters, people! There was a side of spiced mayo to jazz it up. Hey, don't brag about sustainability and then put a burger like this as the only veggie option alongside a variety of meat burgers. Nothing to celebrate about the chicken cutlet sandwich, either.\n\nSeems like Sandler's can't figure out if it's a trendy, local-sourced eatery in a cool, classic old hotel location - or a sports/tourist bar. With the 3 huge TVs, high decibel level, inattention to quality service, and lack of imagination about the menu, I'd say the sports bar is winning. Yes, they use plastic bags.\n\nIn sum, I'm sitting there thinking, why am I eating dinner in this place when there are within a few blocks some incredibly great restaurants deliver service and food at such a higher level for roughly the same price?\n\nIn fairness, the Conshohocken Type A IPA on tap was excellent, and the onion rings were, too.

First off, I will say that I did NOT register for this race to set any sort of PR (personal record), and I just wanted to go out and enjoy the run with thousands and thousands of people in STL.  I did have a great time and it was a fun way to start out the spring racing season (excited!), but the run itself and the runner's village was frustrating.\n\nPositive things:\n-Easy online registration & good pre-race info given via emails \n-Great atmosphere!\n-You can take metrolink right to the start\n-The racing chip is on the back of the bib, so no messing with putting it on your shoe and having to cut it off later\n-3 different corral sections for various running abilities (1: elite/in it to win it, 2: good runners going for a good race time, 3: runners, joggers, walkers, crawlers, whatever)\n-Good course with various hills & it was fun running the streets of downtown\n\n\nNegative/frustrating things:\n-Walkers, strollers, crawlers, etc. ALL over the course (i.e. on the left and right side of the road) making it extremely difficult to go anywhere or get around anyone.  I never heard any of the race officials say \"walkers on the right, runners on the left,\" which would have been VERY helpful\n\n-There were SO many people that I ended up walking/slow jogging the first half mile because it was so cramped. I feel like a lot of this could have been solved by putting the walkers on one side. \n\n-No bag check. I know, I know...this is not necessary and it would be a pain for the organizers, but it would have been a nice touch.  I went by myself so I had no one to hold my stuff.  I had to wear a certain jacket that had a pocket in it for my keys, phone, $$, ID and metrolink pass. Just kinda annoying.\n\n-The runner's village was lacking & very disorganized!  There was only one small entrance to it, which was far from the finishing line.  It took forever for runners to get there & was like a bottleneck traffic jam, so runners kept jumping the fence. There was absolutely NO free food...not even bagels or bananas! Major dislike.  They had tents set up with food inside the village, but you had to buy it & I kept hearing runners complain about how they didn't have any money on them.  They were handing out energy drinks, water and beer (one free per runner using the coupon on your bib) for free, but not in the same spot.  Several people asked me where I got the beer and I pointed them to a far off side of the village that was unmarked.  I finally found some water, but never found that energy drink.  I feel like it would have been MUCH better if they just used the village to have drinks and some sort of food for runners, ALL well marked with high signs to show people where to go.  Get the other food tents out of there...it's way too confusing & packed.

I never even won bingo in grade school.  Most of my gambling expenditions have resulted in failure, to the point where I limit myself to losing a predetermined sum (a low one at that) before giving up and not gambling any more.\n\nThat said, I have done very well here.  I have hit 4 of a kind on video poker the last THREE times I have been here.  Now that is luck.  I also have won the section roulette promotion the St. Louis Blues do at games where every person in a specific section wins a free buffet.  Twice.  And that's only going to like 6 or 7 games last season!  \n\nCompared to other casinos in the area, this is by far the luckiest one for me.  And isn't that how people *really* measure casinos?  I mean come on they all have the same slots, table games, bars, etc.  And let's be honest here, the Lumiere is very sleek and is a lot more modern than other area casinos.  For the most part, the clientele here is higher end than other area offerings too, as there are far fewer old ladies hooked to oxygen machines smoking cigarettes than other casinos.\n\nOther neat things about the Lumiere is the parking is free, or at least it has been every time I have gone.  You can usually get a garage spot.  So park here, gamble a bit and head over to the Landing or Washington Ave, and you will have a great night.  Only Ameristar in St. Charles has cool stuff nearby you can walk too.  The staff is usually prompt and friendly.  \n\nNow my biggest complaint with this place is the lack of table games versus slots, and the fact that they have no video roulette or speed roulette.  I friggin love roulette but there are maybe 2 or 3 tables, that fill up very quickly, and go very slowly.  They used to have a whole wall full of video roulette machines, but no longer.  You expect about 5 to 10 minutes per wheel spin on Friday and Saturday nights.  Bummer.\n\nThe drinks are expensive, which is just another way casinos rake in the dough.  This isn't Vegas, where cheap drinks make for for more compulsive gambler. Everywhere else, it's more like compulsive gamblers want drinks, no matter the price.  Still, it is a bummer spending close to 10 bucks a for a couple of boring ole' Bud Selects.  \n\nSo the Lumiere is my favorite gambling spot in St. Louis.  I think compared to other casinos in the area, it is top notch.  Ameristar in St. Charles is another great one, but that's much further from me.

They have beer on tap as well as bottles. The music is sometimes too loud followed by sudden moments of silence which could make it awkward if you're in the middle of a conversation and happens to be speaking loudly for your company to hear when this happens.

I went to my first show at the War Memorial Auditorium on a Sunday for the Conan & Friends tour. I LOVE Conan so I was on the website buying the tickets the minute the pre-sale started. We carefully picked our seats and thought we had the perfect spot. After paying for the tickets online, they were emailed to us and we just had to print them off. \n\nFinally the night came to go see my beloved Conan. We followed the directions on the WMA website and found the free parking they suggested. It's Capital Hill Center parking and is free after 6 pm. There were plenty of spots and it's only about a block down from the venue. The show started at 8 pm and we arrived around 7:30. The line was out the door and wrapped around a bit. However, the line went quickly and they had Conan Brand Reps walking around and handing out pins. Gotta love free stuff! When we got to the front, a security guard checked my purse and did the wand scan thingy. A lady then scanned our tickets and directed us to our seats. We wanted to use the restroom before the show started so we followed the signs to the basement. This was the first negative. There are only one set of bathrooms and they are in the basement. If you are seated in the balcony, it's kind of a long trip. There was a small bar down by the restrooms so we decided to grab our drinks here. They had a decent selection of beer and mixed drinks. I was able to get a tall boy IPA for $8. Not bad. We headed back upstairs to find our seats. Another negative I noticed. When you first walk in, the main bar is right to the left. There isn't a lot of room and when the line gets backed up, it's hard to move around. The front area gets crowded fast so you find yourself pushing your way through the crowd and lines. I wanted to check out some of the merchandise but didn't want to go through the sea of people again. Our seats were in the balcony and were easy to find. Up some stairs and to the left. We were on the left side of the stage in the middle row right in front of the stage (if that makes sense). We had the perfect angle to see the performers, or so we thought. The auditorium is older so the seats are old theater seats. They were comfortable enough and I think the stage is visible from all seats in the balcony. I did notice the floor seats were just padded chairs they put out for events. I understand why they need to do this but I know those seats were not cheap. I could see people being disappointed by this. We were lucky enough to have the row in front us stay empty. This gave us a very clear view of the front of the stage. The show started and everything was good. We could see Conan, the sound was good, and of course the show was hilarious. The big problem came when one of the comedians performed and his show was based off of a powerpoint. On the back wall of the stage, there was a big screen. At our angle, the big screen was completely blocked by the huge speakers they have hanging from the ceiling. Everyone around us craned their necks trying to see what was on the screen. Without any visuals, we couldn't understand his jokes and missed out on an entire set. I also felt bad for the comedian because no one in our section or the section across could laugh at his jokes. While our tickets were not the most expensive, they also weren't cheap. Next time I will choose a center seat in the balcony, even though that would put me farther away from the stage. If I didn't need to see the screen, the seats would have been perfect.\n\nWhile I listed some negatives, I rounded up to 4 stars because I know it's an old building (built in 1925) and I'm against tearing places like this down to build new shiny ones. The architecture is beautiful and you can feel the history of the auditorium. I liked the fact that this venue has seating because I get so annoyed with standing in GA crowds. While it's not my favorite venue in Nashville, I would go back for a performer I really liked.", "date": "2018-11-23 22:01:32"}, {"_key": "10006875", "_id": "reviews/10006875", "_rev": "_fNzDyWq--_", "review_id": "MtcMAn41VZRPFBSHgDv_qw", "user_id": "8wQIoFapkegkC5fcVYg_Iw", "business_id": "8LHwxmeaY1Ovh4_ekqXXJg", "stars": 5, "useful": 5, "funny": 2, "cool": 3, "text": "I hadn't had a sit down dinner here in forever but my grandmother, sister, and I had dinner here last night.

The texture was lovely because it was made with olive oil, but it was plated with large pools of white and chocolate sauce that reminded me unpleasantly of melted ice cream.

And she makes recommendations for products tailored to my hair.  The salon has some great products, although they are pricey.\n\nOne of my absolute favorite things about this salon is the SHAMPOO CHAIRS!!  They have a headrest built into the sink so you are not breaking your neck while getting washed!!  I know this may seem trivial -- but OMG it makes a huge difference!!  I can actually sit back and enjoy my shampoo and scalp massage without pain.   Another thing I love (and highly recommend) is the gloss treatment.  It's a serum you can add on after your shampoo that makes your hair so silky, shiny, and soft.  They also sell a kit with these serums that you can take home and apply yourself in between appointments.\n\nThe salon's location was a little tricky to find -- it was on the backside of a building, kind of hidden from the road.

He wore a fanny pack too, of course. It was like a bright blue flag announcing himself as a clueless tourist. The sneakers with white socks pulled up his pale-white calves further identified him as a midwesterner - probably a Plains Stater.\n\nHis friend (or business colleague?) stood nearby against a wall with a weak grin, trying to keep half an eye on his buddy.

Nobody \"loves and appreciates\" their rectum, yet everyone is thankful for it's functionality and realizes that without it - we would be incomplete and unable to live. Nobody is proud of the feelings of lust and desire that control us at times either - but they are part of our being, and serve a purpose.\n\nBourbon Street is the dark passenger that resides in all humanity.

Jazz Fest is  the biggest music festival in New Orleans. I love the entire festival experience, the music, the food, local art vendors, and the peak is definitely the people watching. Jazz fest fashion deserves a review of its own. I wish I knew where some of the people got their clothes and how long it took them to think of a their assemble. I am always bewildered at the fact that some women wear 4 inch stilettos to walk the mostly dirt/grass path. That is commitment right there. Now, onto the actual fest. The music is great and while certain entertainers might have my initial attention I always discover a new musical act that usually becomes my favorite show of the fest. It's always a delightful surprise. I love spreading out a big blanket and just taking in the sounds and sights of the fest from afar. \n\nThe food is always a big draw for me as I love to eat! Jazz fest is the only place you can get 5 star cuisine on a paper plate. I wish I had enough room in my stomach to eat all the food, but sadly I have to pick and choose like Sophie's choice. The ATM fees are high so make sure you bring cash to pay for your eats! \n\nJazz fest also has a variety of local art vendors that is interesting and fun to peruse. You might find your next favorite art piece to put in your home, which acts as a great souvenir from the fest. Jazz fest posters are also for sale and you can get them signed or unsigned by the artist. \n\nMy 3 key tips to surviving Jazz Fest: \n1. bring water (must be factory sealed but it will save you some money and its important to stay hydrated in the sun/humidity/heat) \n2. sunscreen (again its hot and there is little to no shade) \n3. wet wipes (Your hands will get sticky and dirty somehow so you will be thankful to have a portable hand washing station) \n4. Waterproof blanket (this comes especially handy after it rains, and it always does) \n\nMost importantly, be cool and have a good time!", "date": "2014-05-03 17:28:22"}, {"_key": "10007695", "_id": "reviews/10007695", "_rev": "_fNzDzLG--D", "review_id": "YCnr4GiwlQt8v17iaHIJoQ", "user_id": "qRb3sant7B3ua99_NYi9Ww", "business_id": "OYCMbxOnPRTfyDKIhnIV2A", "stars": 4, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "I went to Smashburger today for the first time and I loved it.

The class' twenty-six students were taught to make a cucumber roll, a pickled radish roll, a California roll (8 pieces), a spicy tuna hand roll, a grilled salmon hand roll, a shrimp tempura and fish super roll (10 pieces), spicy tuna gunkanmaki (small handwrap roll), and tuna, salmon, white tuna, shrimp, and Japanese sprout nigiri. The fish was super fresh and the sushi rice was phenomenal, perhaps the best I've ever tasted. Making something that tastes just as good, if not better, than what I can get at the best sushi restaurants is simply amazing. Nothing beats sushi that you can eat moments after it is made.\n\nI found the class fun, informative, and filled with nice people. We learned how to make three different kinds of maki rolls, the classic hoso (regular), ura (reverse, or rice on the outside), and temaki (hand roll). We learned how to make different shape rolls, such as round, square, and triangle. We also learned how to create a \"super roll,\" which is a larger than normal roll with premium ingredients and a little design in it. The design is basically a little curl showing in the roll.\n\nMadame Saito demonstrated how rolls can be arranged with ginger or edible flowers to improve their aesthetic appeal. My Mercer sashimi knife was perfect for the class and impressed several students around me who found it to be superior to their Crate & Barrel version.\n\n\"Whoaaa!!! That's a real sushi knife!\" they said.\n\nWell, sort of. Mercer is an American company using German steel.\n\n\"Is it easy to cut the rolls with it? I've been going back and forth, back and forth with my knife,\" one student asked.\n\n\"Oh, yeah, one slice cuts right through it,\" I replied.\n\nIt was especially good for slicing thin pieces of sashimi, its intended use. Madame Saito mentioned that any interested students could enter her sushi competition held every year in April. While everyone focused on making monster-sized pieces of sushi, I made much smaller, more delicate pieces that reminded me of the sushi I've enjoyed at Morimoto and other authentic sushi restaurants. Sushi isn't supposed to be big mamma-jamma he-man sized. It's supposed to be small and pretty, made with tiny hands like mine.\n\n\"Never use sriracha mayo with raw fish, only for tempura,\" Madame Saito warns. \"Mayonnaise with raw fish not good. Cannot taste the fish. Use only sriracha,\" she said.\n\nIt makes sense and now I see why I never liked all of those little holes in walls that Yelp reviewers love so much. Those inferior restaurants always drizzled sriracha mayo on everything. I was loving every piece of salmon, white tuna, and red tuna sashimi I sliced. None of the fish needed any seasoning at all. The class basically includes a make-your-own meal for $185. With a little bit of practice, I'm confident I could make better sushi than most places that charge $25 for a sushi dinner entr\u00e9e.\n\n\"Mmmm!!!

I've been here before for their Szechuan dishes and have always enjoyed the food. But recently I came on a cold winter evening with a couple friends in the mood for hotpot. I grew up eating a lot of hotpot, and judge it based on three general criteria: the soup broth, the quality of the ingredients, and the dipping sauces.\n\nWe ordered the duo broth with half Szechuan chili broth and half original. While flavorful, they both tasted high in msg. I think I would have preferred plain hot water. \n\nNow onto the ingredients. The veggies, tofu, and noodles we ordered were fine. But the lamb and beef were disappointing. They were covered in a cornstarch mixture, which is supposed to help meats maintain a tender, velvety texture. But in this case just tasted mushy and soft. In fact, it was hard to distinguish the lamb from the beef amidst the overly powerful soup broth and the dense cornstarch coating. \n\nAs for the sauce, we ordered barbecue. It was basically the satay sauce. Don't get me wrong, I love satay, but it lacked seasoning. Soy sauce, sesame paste, or anything would have given it a little needed something extra. I felt like they were just lazy and scooped a couple spoonfuls from the Bull Head can and called it a day.\n\nThe bill came to about $27 pp which was quite pricey considering the humble amount we ordered. The soup base was approx $22 and each additional dish is between $3 and $8, so it's definitely more economical to come with a bigger group.\n\nGiven the disappointing broth, meats, sauce, and price, I won't recommend this place for hotpot.

Be sure to check out their monthly celebrations, which feature a 10 course prix fixe dinner for only $30pp, including beverages; beer and wine sold separately. This dinner is open to the public, with limited seating, so calling ahead is essential. \n\nI attended their May Celebration, where I met up with fellow Yelpers and Reno Foodie group members. We were seated at three large round tables with large lazy susans in the center that made passing the family style dishes around to each of the guests.  \n\nEllen greeted us with a friendly hello and a bag of logan berries and fresh lychee, both are transparent fruit that you peel and eat, and are clean and sweet.  I would say they make for a great palate cleanser before we began the meal.  \n\nPeter, our server for the evening, brought out individual dishes of the Peking Duck Bun. It was sweet and delicious, lots of texture and flavor.  \n\nSecond course was the Spicy Fried Chicken Wing.  You will not get a typical wing, instead it was chopped up wings, plated with green onions, red hot chilli peppers, and hot peanuts.  The kick in those bite sized, bone in nuggets was fantastic.  I'm not a fan of getting around bones in my meat, but the effort to eat up these scrumptious pieces was totally worth it. \n\nTo add some green to our menu for the evening, our third course was Sin Gua with Green Soybean.  Ellen described it as Chinese squash.  Nothing remarkable here, just a fresh vegetable staple to balance everything else in the meal.  \n\nFourth course...bring on the meat!  The Lion Head Meat Ball was a hearty presentation of two large meatballs,consisting of ground pork and tantalizing sauce, decoratively surrounded by bok choy.  It had a meatloaf texture, but the flavor was very tasty, and was complemented well with some steamed rice. It's my understanding that this particular item requires a 24 hour notice to make it properly.  If you're a planner, I recommend giving this one a try.\n\nFifth course, the Enoki Mushroom with Sliced Ribeye.  I was a little nervous about this one because I'm not a fan of mushrooms.  But this was a thinly sliced meat and veggie dish that came with amazing flavor and tenderness, and I devoured quite a bit of it. \n\nSixth course was a clay pot with salted fish and eggplant.  I am neither a fan of cooked fish nor eggplant, so I skipped over this dish.  Yes, I am strange...I like fish mostly when it's raw.\n\nSeventh course, Sizzling Scallops and Prawns.  There were also calamari, mushrooms and green peppers with this dish.  It was light in flavor and texture, not over salted.  Definitely a wonderful dish for seafood lovers.\n\nNext up, the eighth course, Deep Fried Whole Flounder.  And by whole, they mean whole...head to tail, fins and bones.  As mentioned above, I am not a fan of cooked fish.  But I was willing to give this a try, and surprisingly, I liked it.  I didn't take the first bite, so I was able to fish around (pun intended) with the spoon to scoop up a piece of the meat and it was quite tasty.  The one sampling was enough for me, and it was entertaining watching everyone else attack and enjoy it.  And if you're a fish lover, I say order up the flounder and be sure to share. \n\nNinth course, which was actually more of an accompaniment to the scallops and flouner, was the dried scallop with egg white fried rice.  Ellen mentioned there was no added seasoning to the rice.  It was light and flavorful, though not fishy at all.  \n\nTenth course, the dessert; hand made stuffed sweet mochi.  This was another dish I was nervous about because I was not a fan of the mochi dessert we had had at the Yelp Elite event.  I figured I had to try, and I'm glad I did.  It was a sweet \"broth\" with two mochi balls filled with a sesame paste.  It was gummy and it was yummy.  Ellen even came over and asked me if I liked it this time. I gave her my approval with a smile. \n\nOverall, it was a most enjoyable dinner.  I felt like Tony and Ellen treated us like family with their warmth, humor, and hospitality.  It was great to dine with familiar friends like Chris M., Ernie, Nancy and Robert, and make new friends with Brad and Robin.  For me, a dinner isn't just about the food, it's also about the service and the company.  Peter was great in keeping our drinks filled and giving us clean plates.  I also had the pleasure of mingling with some guests at the other tables.

If you are looking for something different, this is a great place for Chinese food. We are pretty adventurous and like to try new things. On this day, we were both looking at the Crispy Fried Duck Tongue unbeknownst to each other. When the waitress came over we asked her what she would recommend and she suggested the spicy beef tendon or spicy beef stomach. Since we couldn't decide which one we wanted she offered to give us a combination of both. When we asked her about the crispy duck tongue she said it was just too spicy for her but they are like potato chips in China.\n\nThe spicy beef tendon and stomach came first. It was garnished with a generous amount of cilantro and a spicy chili sauce. It looked amazing but I was surprised when I took the first bite and it was cold. I wasn't expecting cold because we didn't see it on the menu before we ordered it but it was clearly listed as a Cold Dish. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was cold. I think it would have been good hot as well. I remember having tendon years ago with my best friend from China and recalled that I didn't care for it but couldn't remember why.  It's not that it tastes bad but it is an unusual texture for me. It is a little hard but not crunchy. Kind of chewy? I have a hard time describing it. On the other hand, I love stomach and this was sliced in strips so it was easy to eat. I might have liked a little more sauce because it was really good on the steamed rice.\n\nThe spicy fried duck tongue arrived. The tongue is coated in egg and cornstarch and then tossed with dried red chiles. I think the thing that surprised me most about these is that there is a little bone in the tongue. She told us there was bone in it but we both just thought she misspoke and it was going to be tendon or something. She was right and we were wrong. The tongue was actually very  tasty. The meat was tender and easily came off the bone. I admit it was a little odd at first but after the first couple of pieces I understood why they are eaten like potato chips! I would definitely order them again.\n\n168 also has an Asian market a little further south on Virginia across from the Peppermill.

I mean they have no cushions and are steel making them so so terrible to sit on. The ones up at the bar were disappointing. They did have a tiny cushion on them, but no back to them. We could only sit for one drink before our backs started hurting.  We also ordered the pomme frites and they were underwhelming. $6 for fries that had nothing special but Parmesan cheese on top seems a little pricey to me. Maybe if they added truffle oil or something to spruce them up they would be better. I did enjoy that they were smaller and crispy, how I usually like them. Now the service and drinks are pretty much the only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars. Our bartender was incredibly friendly, very prompt with greeting us and making our drinks, and made some killer filthy martinis.

In one word: decadent. The Carnival Craving was easily for two if not 4 people. So much for price and lots of complimentary flavors and textures. It's BOMB.

There is no draft beer offered here with twice as man cans than bottles in the beer selection.\n\nGuacamole and fresh chips were ordered and served quickly. The chips are light and crisp for breaking up and dipping as another unique representation of the restaurant. Guacamole was \"fine\" as in we ate it, but probably wouldn't order again. \n\nWe tried a half-dozen different tacos, all of which price at $2.50 or $3.50. They were served perfectly, quickly and with ultra fresh taste.\n\nOf the six, we probably would eliminate the pork belly next time as the pork pastor satisfied that craving without the extra fat. I personally would love another handful of the other five with special mention of the chorizo, ribeye and even the duck. (You can look elsewhere here on Yelp for a review of the oyster taco. I'd rather skateboard at a Charlie Belcher live shot than eat anything involving an oyster.)\n\nThe tacos initially look small, but deliver the flavor in about 3-4 bites each because there is a good amount of protein packed in each one. \n\nThose additional sauces available are very good and deliver a nice finishing kick, although it isn't necessary with the kimchi already part of the fine ribeye version.\n\nAnd then there was the gazpacho, always a favorite of mine virtually anywhere as long as it isn't the pineapple version. \n\nBartaco's gazpacho offers a huge amount for just $5 with huge croutons already floating on top. This isn't as hearty and red as what I'm used to, but the more orange and creamy interpretation still delivered and showed another unique touch from this restaurant.\n\nI'm a huge sports fan, so I notice when any restaurant now days offers absolutely zero TVs anywhere including above the bar.

It was delightful with the passion-fruit flavor. I didn't drink an entire one, but I shared with my boyfriend. My coffee however, was easily 10 times better than Starbucks with robust flavor. \n\nNow, it's time to give credit to the server who made this experience incredible. If I remember correctly, George was our server who served roughly 13 people at a table. He was incredibly efficient at getting everyone's order, dividing them accurately and then refilling and making sure we were all happy. This man is a super-star, and he deserves a lot of credit for handling the table so well. I was thoroughly impressed! I can't say I've ever seen a waitstaff member do a job so well, and I mean that from the bottom of my heart. I was very appreciative of his work and dedication to making sure we loved our food, and loved the food I did! \n\nI will certainly be back to Red Mesa. I hope I can find some tasty vegetarian bites on their lunch or dinner menu, or possibly something vegan.

So I used my Yelp app and it's nearby feature. So I identified the original building I was curious about (a coffee shop) but also showed this space. If I knew a Katrina memorial existed, I must have blocked it out. And it was just down the street...\n \nPrior to being the Memorial, this was the cemetery for folks who donated their bodies to science and then were interred. Or for the folks whose bodies were never claimed at old Charity or were never identified. No markers, no headstones. \n\nThe new space is lovely and sad as is fitting. The curving lines suggest the traditional spiral shape of the hurricane symbol and the stark black marble monoliths are appropriate. I guess the banks of wall tombs are for future cadavers? Or maybe just a reminder? There are no markers on those. \n\nThe plantings were pretty barren in late January, even if it is warm. I'll have to go back and see the cypress trees and garden when it's spring or summer. \n\nLike most things Katrina-related, just being in the space made me cry. It's been a tough 7+ years back.

This year my company again had seats in the Club section and each time I had the chance to receive tickets the experience was great.  \n\nCompared to last year though I have to say the food both in the the club section and outside the club section I think may be suffering somewhat.  The last two years prior I know I could go right out side the 300 sections in the Mezzanine area and pay $8 for some of the best nachos I've ever had from one of the carts outside.  This year they replaced that cart with a specialty brat cart that wasn't quite what I was looking for but it was alright in hindsight.  They did have a really nice Mushroom and Swiss brat that was surprisingly tasty but I found a lot of the rest of the food to not be the same quality as years past.  The hot dogs this year just didn't taste the same as in years past and I couldn't quite put my finger on it.  Back to the Club section food, each night they would have a menu printed for what was the special for that evening.  Usually I would get there an hour before game time and fill up with hot dogs and chicken strips in the restaurant area.  The chicken strips were good but again I noticed a difference from the year before. \n\nThe best thing about Scottrade Center was when they started allowing me to do debit/credit card transactions at the vendor stands instead of always having the have cash.  I believe the Blues were the first place to do this as I remember going to a Rams game and having to fill out a form for this \"gift card\" like deal and put money on that if I didn't want to pay an ATM fee.  Kudos to Ownership for doing that.  It made going to games less of a hassle and more enjoyable that I was able to actually purchase something that I wanted.    \n\nAs always, each year drinkers are subjected to higher prices when it comes to ordering alcohol at games and Scottrade was no exception.  In the club section you have a limited choice of 4 beers and 3 wines.  I'm a Budweiser drinker but in the Club section they only serve Bud Light, Select, Miller Lite and one other I could never remember because they never had just Budweiser.  When I would sit up in the Mezzanine, beer was $8.00 but now I feel even more obligated to tip since it is more of a bar mentality rather than a vendor mentality.  I would always go to the stand near 303 where it would just be alcohol and peanuts and I just felt that this was more of a sports bar area than a vendor stand in a stadium.  \n\nThere is nothing like taking in a Hockey game live and I have to say there is not a bad seat in the entire place.  I love sitting up high in the Mezzanine as much as I liked sitting in the Club section.  Everyone I sat around was friendly and we all knew the rules and respected one another (like don't get up until a stoppage, come back to your seat during a TV timeout, etc).  \n\nThe food took a bit of a dive this year and I wish the Blues would have made the playoffs as attending a Playoff game in Scottrade Center is a completely different experience, but I still love the place and I hope the team and the venue find great new ownership just like we've had in the past 5 years.", "date": "2011-04-12 17:54:24"}, {"_key": "10011046", "_id": "reviews/10011046", "_rev": "_fNzDzu---J", "review_id": "7SRJC6An-iKrGC8vZLUeQw", "user_id": "0du93EkEwKuxRG_x6hqVUg", "business_id": "m_kvoXITBvYDofmcKpWEmw", "stars": 4, "useful": 2, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "text": "Well, Brown's Diner is apparently a well-seasoned Nashville classic.

We told him we understood and after calming down, the employee told us we could sit at the bar and sit get served food.\n\nAfter a rude introduction, I enjoyed sitting at the bar.

I had been seeing her since early 2015 and her and her receptionists could never get anything right.\n\nFirst and foremost. I was on anti depressants prescribed by Molly. Molly only gave me a months worth per prescription, which is fine but she required that I take a physical every single month to get a new prescription. Even though I told her that with my job, that I do not get my schedule until 2 weeks in advance and I work 10-13 hr shifts and could not make appointments far in the future. She told me that I could take take the latest appointments and put a note that it was okay if I showed up late. Well, I would show up late to my appointments and I would get turned away and have to reschedule. And then when I show up for appointments on time, she would get to me an hour after I arrive. So I had to pay for my meds, pay for each physical per month, and pay for appointments that I did not show up on time for. So a huge money suck. I had to go off my meds because there would days or even a week gap between me running out of my meds and getting the new prescription, it was literally causing me physical pain to go through withdrawal almost every month. I told Molly this. She said the physicals were required for her peace of mind.\n\nWhen I needed a referral to a sleep doctor, Molly's office first sent the request to someone who did not take my insurance. The second person they sent it to, was in the wrong city. The 3rd person they sent it to, was the second person, a second time. They finally sent it to the right person on the 4th try. What should have taken a week, took over 2 months with me hounding them because they cannot be trusted to do their job.\n\nI had pain and instability in my knees and for months and Molly did not give me a referral until a year after my problems started. The first referral was for an XRay and a waste of time because it found nothing. The 2nd referral was for an MRI and it found that I had torn my ACL. Molly had dismissed my pain for over a year and delayed me getting treatment because of her disbelief.\n\nWhen I asked to get some blood work done, I had to wait 2 months. When I got there, Molly told me it was my fault for not pushing her staff harder to get in sooner.\n\nThat same appointment I needed her to do my pap. It clearly states in my folder that I am allergic to Latex. Molly did not have latex. She then proceeded to tell me that if they could not find latex free gloves (KEEP IN MIND THAT I WORK IN HEALTH AND NO ONE HAS LATEX GLOVES! THAT ALLERGY IS SO PREVALENT THAT ALMOST EVERYONE EXCLUSIVELY CARRIES NITRILE GLOVES AND THIS IS A WOMAN DOCTOR WHO SPECIALIZES IN WOMEN'S HEALTH AND SHE DOESN'T HAVE LATEX FREE GLOVES!?!?!) that I can reschedule.

With that said, the wait staff was constantly at our table to get our order. Being that neither of us have tried Vietnamese, it took us a min to decide...a min that was interrupted multiple times.

My friend tried the spring rolls, which she also enjoyed. Looking over the menu, neither of us thought the wording of \"Assorted Seafood\" or \"Assorted Meats\" was descriptive enough to give us an idea of what we'd be eating. Simple enough, we'll just have to ask the waitress...wich Assorted Seafood was squid, shrimp and fish balls...now I will save you my joke on the fish balls thing but it just didn't sound right lol. I went with the assorted meats & stick noodles which were chicken, beef and pork. The dish was flavorful but the large cilantro leaves were very powerful...and not knowing if that's part of the cuisine I dealt with it...but I would have preferred them to be chopped and mixed in...so if you're not a cilantro lover, make sure to say that in the beginning. My friend's dish also had massive amts of cilantro and of course, the menu just said Assorted meats, seafood and noodles.... \n\nOverall I think it's a nice place.

My quest to do so led me to the Mermaid Tavern, a divey kind of hipster bar in Seminole Heights. I had heard a lot of good things about this place, especially their burgers, and since I am a huge burger lover, I decided to give it a shot.\n\nMermaid Tavern is tucked away in a not-so-great part of town, but the place itself is pretty nice. Dim lighting and small, so there are not a ton of tables. My boyfriend and I didn't have trouble finding a spot to sit, however, so we checked out the menu, headed up to the bar and placed our orders.\n\nWe started with the fried pickles, which were a little different than other fried pickles I've had since they were chopped and then fried and usually fried pickles are whole pickle slices. Still, with the remoulade sauce, they provided the perfect mix of savory and slightly sweet -- yes, the pickles had a somewhat sweet flavor.\n\nFor entrees, my boyfriend got the Kefta burger since he is a huge fan of goat cheese, while I opted for the \"create your own\" style Tavern burger. Both were the same size but had vastly different flavors. My boyfriend's had this greek tzatziki-style aioli, while my burger had an IPA-style aioli. I preferred my burger to his, but both tasted great. \n\nAt 6.5 oz, these burgers aren't massive by any means -- I mean, this is bar food after all, so don't expect it to be humongous. We both got salads as our sides, but the fries looked amazing as well, so I would definitely be down to try them in the future.\n\nIf you're into craft beer, Mermaid Tavern also has a pretty decent selection.\n\nOverall this place was very no-frills, relaxing and pretty cool.

The first time was absolutely lovely. I sat at the bar with a friend and we had the time of our lives and a lovely lunch. The service was spectacular. The bartender was very attentive, friendly and engaging. It really made out experience superb. Te lamb hummus is INCREDIBLE and I wish I could eat this every day. This was a few weeks ago and he had just started working there. I wish I remembered his name because he was awesome. I would have given Shaya 5 stars back then.\n\nI visited the restaurant for lunch again with my family who was from out of town. We came in for lunch and it was a very bizarre experience. Our waiter was very patronizing. He got upset with our group when we did not follow his recommendations. He doesn't know our situation or what our likes/dislikes are so no one should ever take this offensively. When we sat down, I had asked him to put in an order of the lamb hummus with extra bread to be sent. He had suggested us not get bread to start off with because we will fill up... I told him it would be okay (my family loves bread and this does not fill us up). He then proceeded to bring us an absurd amount of bread. It was ridiculous and coming nonstop. This was an exaggeration... we'd have two loaves of bread on our table and they'd come out with two more loaves. It felt very patronizing. My family had asked me to order for everyone since I had already been there. I placed an amount I thought would be perfect for us and his response was that this was enough for 2 people.... we were a group of 8 people, 3 of which were not eating. We felt pressured to order more and ended up ordering 2 more chicken sandwiches that were absolutely disgusting... this might have just been our personal opinion but I would not order this again. We ended up with WAY more food than we could finish. Maybe he was hoping to get a bigger tip because we ordered more? I don't know but we definitely did not appreciate getting that pressure to order more food. \n\nWhat was very bizarre about this situation was our waiter. There really was no need for such a weird treatment. It really made my entire family feel so uncomfortable. I can't remember his name but he spoke with a British accent but was from the states. I'd expect them to be much more sensitive to how they treat their customers considering all the bad press they have been receiving lately.

To start off we thought we'd try a combo plan of paleo and classic meals, two a day for a week. That would give us a good idea of what we liked or didn't like and a general overview of how the program works. At first glance, the price seems steep, but when you break the cost down to a per-meal number, it works out to be slightly more expensive than going out to eat (and the CF meals are good for you and keep you full longer, so it seems like a good deal.)\nLarger portion sizes (called Athletic) are a $1.00 more per meal, and several of them have been large enough that I can see splitting them up into two meals. This would be a good way to go if you like smaller portions and wanted to stretch your money out a bit. On the website, there is an option to personalize your meal a bit, such as if you don't like olives, mushrooms, dairy-free, etc. I believe that can be changed in the settings, but I haven't tried it yet, as I'm still pretty satisfied with my situation. If you try to select a meal that has a component you've chosen to exclude, you'll get a popup window that warns you of this. You can then make the choice to continue with that choice or make another. Each meal also includes a nutritional break down, so if you're counting macros, CF makes that easy, too.\n\nAdditionally, I love the option of being able to pick from three options for my meals. Even though we go with lunch and dinner, it's nice that we can also choose to have a breakfast meal delivered should it sound like something we can't miss. Every night between 6:30-7 (your times may vary), the meals for the next day are delivered. They keep in the fridge for three days, but can also be frozen, too. I haven't tried reheating from frozen yet, so I can't speak to that. I've gotten more satisfactory heating results if I stir things around a bit and separate my meat a little bit so that I'm not still getting cold/more room temperature bites.\n\nLike another reviewer said, it seems like taste is a priority at CF. Not only can I rest easy knowing that I don't have to think about what I'm eating even a little, but I also look forward to my next meal knowing that the work is completely absent and it's still gonna taste good. It also helps keep my cheats in check because I don't talk myself into something on the way home from school to while I'm out running errands. This peace of mind has really helped me push that much harder to reach my next fitness goal because the food aspect, which can be overwhelming in many ways, is taken care of. I think my husband appreciates that, too, because we're not spending a ton at the grocery store, I'm not always hangry, and dinner time is a breeze.\n\nAs you can tell, I have very few, if any complaints about this service. Suggestions, yes, but not complaints. A couple of those suggestions would be a bigger container so that everything isn't bunched together as it reheats, and the option for more than 4 exclusions (or to be more specific, for items like cilantro. I couldn't eat last night's spaghetti sauce because cilantro was mixed in throughout).\n\nWhile yes, it IS a bit like eating leftovers, I think it's not as bad as that, especially when this service comes with so many other benefits.", "date": "2019-02-05 20:58:47"}, {"_key": "10011985", "_id": "reviews/10011985", "_rev": "_fNzDz76--F", "review_id": "KpmJJR8IAo6B5pWSVuzSKA", "user_id": "qEIIYHLzHVU6md7A7Iehhg", "business_id": "USNgqY8jQtEXUuEF8PmtCw", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I love farmers markets, and this is a good one.

I don't know why it's taken me this long, but I finally made it and I'm here to stay. \n\nDuring Happy Hour, the ambiance is relaxed, yet bustling. There are plenty of seats at the handsome vintage bar, as well as smaller 2-tops by the bar. We were lucky enough to snag one of these tables so indulged in a few of the Happy Hour offerings, on top of some of the dishes from the regular menu. \n\nRhubarb Basil Smash [$6 Happy Hour | $10 Regular Menu]\nTequila, rhubarb liqueur, grapefruit, basil syrup \n\nThe Rhubarb Basil smash is a slushy on steroids. Saccharine with a nice herbaceousness from the basil and a tartness from the rhubarb liqueur and grapefruit, this will start your night off right. One's probably enough or else you'll go into a diabetic coma, but not going to lie, I ultimately indulged in a second. \n\nCannonball! [$6 Happy Hour] \nBlanco tequila, lime juice, orange, \"Electric blue\" \n\nThe cocktail of the day came in the form of the Cannonball, which was electric blue! Basically Bud & Marilyn's take on a margarita, it was strong and boozy. Our server David knew I enjoyed the basil smash a lot better though, so brought me another one of those instead. Clairvoyant, I tell ya. \n\nNashville Hotbun [$3.50 Happy Hour | $10 for 2 Regular Menu]\nHot fried chicken, little pickles, ranch, pickle brine slaw\n\nBud & Marilyn's standardly has a trio of buns available on the menu. For Happy Hour, they offered the Nashville hot bun, which was stellar. So much so that I had to get another one of these bad boys and was itching for a third. A buttery and crusty bun house crispy chicken. The chicken had a nice cayenne kick that wasn't exactly on a spice level that would make the Fat Ham sweat, but it was just right for the GF. The vinegary slaw and pickles made each bite, offering some acid and respite from the chicken. Get these! \n\nCrispy Cheese Curds [$5 Happy Hour | $8 Regular Menu]\nWisconsin cheddar, smoked guajillo chile salsa, burnt scallion ranch \n\nYou know I won't be denied fried cheese curds, and these are some of the best I've had. Lighter and airier than the Cow and the Curd's take, I enjoyed the glassiness of the crisp batter. The accompanying burnt scallion ranch and smoked guajillo chile offered contrasts for your dipping pleasure. An obvious must order.\n\nPan Seared Pierogis [$6 Happy Hour | $9 Regular Menu]\nShallot, brown butter, apple-celery root salad, horseradish creme fraiche \n\nWell-seared and crisp, the brown butter came through and the creamy potato innards were hearty. The celery root salad offered some freshness and while I enjoyed the creme fraiche, it could have used a bit more horseradish. \n\nPork Belly Buns [$10]\nShaved pork belly, Korean chili, papaya slaw, peanuts \n\nFrom the regular menu, I had to get the pork belly buns. I prefer my pork belly to be thick, unctuous and fatty. Here we're talking about crisp, shaved pork belly housed within buttery buns. The papaya and Korean chili slaw had a nice fermented funk and acidity that I enjoyed. \n\nChop Suey [$12]\nCountry ham fried rice, carrot, broccolini, English pea, fried farm egg, pork belly, kohlrabi, cabbage\n\nThat same crisp pork belly made its way into the chop suey, which was essentially Korean bibimbap fried rice. I loved the acidity from the lime, which offered some balance to the hearty heft of the rice, pork, and fried egg. A healthy portion for only $12! \n\nSeared Sea Scallops [$23]\nFava & corn succotash, pancetta, Castle Valley corn cakes, smoked orange dressing\n\nBud & Marilyn's had a stunner of a scallop dish as well. Well-seared and seasoned, the huge scallops were supported by the additional sweetness from the corn succotash and grit corn cakes. The salty savoriness from the pancetta was appreciated in its effort to prevent the dish from becoming overly sweet. \n\nPeanut Butter Maltball Cake [$9]\nDark chocolate cake, peanut butter buttercream, crispy pearls\n\nDespite being stuffed, I knew I couldn't leave without having tried one of the cakes I've heard so much about. The peanut butter maltball cake was gorgeous to look at and even better to eat. Creamy, chocolatey, and moist, the cake had a nice contrast in texture from the shattered malt pearls. \n\nService at Bud & Marilyn's is top notch, personable, and efficient. And without a doubt, the food here will leave you wanting more. Considering the 80's theme, I was concerned that Bud & Marilyn's might go the way of Kevin Sbraga's now defunct Juniper Commons.

No worries, however because our rockstar waitress, Margaux (the Marvelous) who served us with both aplomb and a killer sense of humor took in our dietary restrictions without blinking an eye. \"Vegan? No problem. These are your options\" (many). \"Gluten free? I'll be sure to bring you vegetables to dip into the hummus\" instead of the (insanely incredible... sorry Celiacs) pita bread.

I promised my sister that if she helped me at work, I'd take her out to dinner to a place of her choosing. Naturally, she slacked on the job, so when she told me that she was choosing a Middle Eastern Restaurant and we showed up at an apartment complex, I almost thought she was letting me off the hook to compensate for her lack of work ethic. As I started to thanklessly push her out of my car (before you feel bad, she's a soulless ginger often [lovingly] referred to as Satan), she pointed to Aroma. I almost didn't believe it was a real restaurant, but because food was involved, I followed her blindly through the parking lot.\n\nAdmittedly, my outlook was bleak. When we go Italian, I trust my sister. When we go Middle Eastern, I trust her as much as an albino who says they love the sun. I've gained an extraordinary amount of weight developing my palate from beginner to sophisticated in the Mediterranean category. Yet, I was hungry---and her only form of transportation. As we walked through the door, I felt like a ditz in a horror movie, realizing there was no turning back.\n\nUpon entrance, we were greeted by the delight of a man who ended up being our server. My sister immediately ordered the Sampler as an appetizer, and momentarily after, chose the second most expensive entr\u00e9e (Lamb Kebab Platter) on the menu for her meal. As I shot her a nasty look across the table, I simultaneously opted for the Chicken Shawerma Platter.\n\nThe Sampler quickly arrived; the plate was filled with generous portions of beet dip, hummus, baba ghanouj, falafel, and grape leaves. I loved every single aspect. The hummus was smooth and creamy, the beet flavor in the beet dip was noticeable but light, the fafalel was moist and tender, and the grape leaves were as authentic as they would be in Syria. I stifled my urge to scream Wawaweewaa! Ooh lala! in my best Borat impersonation. I was excited for dinner.\n\nWhen the waiter brought out my chicken shawerma platter, and I had my fork in hand before the plate was delivered. I'm pretty sure the meal consisted of a heaping helping of chicken accompanied by caramelized onions and grilled tomatoes, but I started eating so fast I didn't have time to notice. Thanks to my fantastic peripheral vision I noticed a second plate placed to my right, on which a mound of rice and hummus were showcased. I could have taken a moment to cry, but I couldn't waste a precious minute on emotion outside of gluttony. It just didn't seem right.\n\nThe chicken was perfect. It was so different from any chicken shawerma; as opposed to lacking noticeable marinade, the chicken was coated in a red sauce. I absolutely loved it. So much so that the delightful waiter didn't have time to make it to the table to ask how everything was before I was finished. Faaaat. But a testament to how great the food is at Aroma. \n\nAs if I hadn't consumed enough, I sampled my sister's lamb; it was so tender I didn't have to exert the force to chew. It melted in my mouth, which I really appreciated after utilizing all my energy shoveling my own food into my mouth. Verrrry nice.\n\nI have to take a moment to praise the delicious salsa that was served with my meal. The salsa brought out the down-right fabulousity (judge me) of the chicken when utilized as dipping sauce. It also made my fork a tasty treat. Probably the best salsa I've tasted anywhere---thanks to it's complexity of flavors that melded together into a seemingly simple sauce. 20 bucks to anyone who can tell me of what this stuff consists. Ready, go.\n\nAroma is a gem. Because I'm so eager to go back, I'd probably treat my sister to round two (by secretly withdrawing money from her account and using it to pay).", "date": "2013-05-27 04:22:14"}, {"_key": "10012552", "_id": "reviews/10012552", "_rev": "_fNzD0EW--D", "review_id": "BWj-b96bKGTjOkTpuUaypA", "user_id": "ld0AperBXk1h6UbqmM80zw", "business_id": "PlaECqs3oPBRo47p85zkzw", "stars": 3, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "A nice early lunch with the family.

We had a lovely table by the window, great service, and a nice view of the Omni.   \n\nEven though it was lunch they made an exception and brought us the butter appetizer you guys have been raving about trying but it was just too much for me.  After eating the truffle butter, the French fat butter, the ginger peanut brittle butter, and the duck butter I already felt uneasy but I wanted to keep going to try to understand the love affair with Etch.  Then we tried the roasted cauliflower with the pea pesto and feta crema which was fine.  I like cauliflower and I've had some really good dishes here in town but I guess I expected it to blow my mind since everyone keeps talking about how great it is.  I probably would have liked it better if the bar wasn't set so high in my mind.  Next we shared the brisket pupusa.  I love a good pupusa but it was so hard to find the little thing buried under thinly sliced brisket and multiple colored sauces.  I pushed aside an onion, meat, cheese, a strange orange sauce, a red sauce, celery leaf avocado smash, lime crema, some veggies, then another white sauce and savored my one little soggy bite of pupusa - good but again all the sauces were very unappetizing to me.  At this point in time I just wanted something normal but even the dessert menu seemed a little frilly.  I settled on the poached apples, roasted apple puree, black currant sauce, toasted almonds, apple chips, on a twinkie...I mean vanilla cake...with a side of olive oil ice cream.

These ended up being unnecessary-- about half the place was full. There seemed to be just three total people on the wait staff but they were more than capable of keeping the whole restaurant under their watch. Very efficient. \nJax has a very quaint atmosphere, full of orange and black notes complete with white and grey highlights-- very modern yet home-like. I approve. \nI actually came with a Groupon that I purchased last week; $20 for two non-alcoholic drinks, an appetizer, and two entrees. I'll take it! From the Groupon website I was under the impression that there were limitations on the entree selection, but our waiter told us otherwise! Major plus. \nA few of us got iced tea and, while it was just a simple black tea, it was clear in nature and delicious. No alcohol this afternoon but I'll definitely be back for their happy hour to try out their half-price signature cocktails!\n\nStarted with the baked goat cheese ($9). Let me just say that goat cheese has always been one of my favorite foods ever. This one definitely didn't disappoint. Smooth with chopped garlic (I think) throughout, it was topped with a tomato confit and had an olive tapenade on the side. It came with some delicious, miniature bread slices. My only complaints: I would probably prefer less of the green oil they put on top and less of the full garlic clove pieces, but that's pretty trivial at this point. If you have any partiality to goat cheese, this is a must-order. \n\nSpring Beet Salad ($10): My aunt had this as her meal and she really enjoyed it. I didn't get to taste it, but it came with what looked like a few DOZEN chopped, yellow beets. \n\nSpecial Sandwich of the Day ($10): Today's special was sliced strip steak (amazing), fontina cheese, carmelized onions, and a horseradish aioli (I held off on this). It came on a hoagie and was served with au jus. While I really did enjoy the sandwich, I thought the bread was a little bit of an afterthought. It was boring and I personally prefer a softer bread. Nevertheless, this was a great sandwich and I wouldn't mind getting it again.\n\nJax \"Classic\" Kobe Burger ($12): Three of my family members had this dish and it was well-received all-around. It had a fun bacon bit type of \"jam\" as they describe it, a HUGE heirloom tomato, and a delicious melted cheese! The bun had an almost sweet element to it. The one comment I got from my mom was that while she liked her burger, she preferred Zinburger. I would actually have to agree with her on this one. \n\nBreakfast for Lunch ($11): Today's special was an omelette with wild mushrooms, goat cheese, and spinach. OMG, GOAT CHEESE. My dad ordered this delectable dish and my fork couldn't stop finding its way to his extra goat cheese and mushrooms. SO good. \n\nRed Velvet Cake: Filled and coated with a phenomenal vanilla cream cheese frosting, this behemoth piece of cake was three layers tall. The cake was very dense (almost that of a cake ball), but still very tasty. So huge it fed all six of us comfortably! \n\nOverall, I will definitely be back to give their dinner menu a shot. Not only this, but I'll make an appearance for their 4-6 PM happy hour complete with half priced appetizers and sweet drink specials.

In the interim I paid a ton of money for a guilt complex and misrepresented impression of what the facility was.

Because, that's the implicit premise, right? I get Instagram's popularity: a picture is worth a thousand words. But, there's a selection bias built-in: how many pictures have you seen of something blah?? Hype is still my prime beef with the gushing praise for Hungry Pigeon: it's a very good restaurant. But, most certainly: everything is NOT awesome. Que Sorpresa! \n\nThe first time I visited was 18 months back, after reading praise about their life-changing breakfast pastries. I tried their butter and chocolate croissants (definitively not Philly's best), realized my life didn't need to be changed, and bucketed them under the kind of restaurant where the quality needed to catch up to the hype. Humbly, I was wrong. When I came back a year later, I was blown away by their egg and cheese breakfast sandwich on a homemade muffin, accompanied by a juicy chicken sausage. The sandwich became my favorite breakfast indulgence (till I discovered Res Ipsa). I also finally understood the appeal of their croissants: their chocolate almond croissant is definitely the best version I've had in the last year, tied with an exceptional version at Arsicault in SF. (I haven't changed my mind regarding the other croissants. Almond croissants are a different genre. The French know that).\n\nAs an all-day restaurant, visiting them for dinner I have loved their Fried Monkfish with Green Curry - it has everything you need in a dish: delightful texture (fish), authentic heat in the green curry broth, root vegetables. Solid 5 stars. I also used to love their (awarded) tomatillo-braised chicken (eaten like tacos) earlier but haven't liked the subsequent chicken entrees. In fact, the one currently on the menu, Roast Chicken with Cheddar Cheese Gratin, the less said about it the better. Ok, I'll say 3 words: Boring AF, while praising the 'winter vegetables' gratin. Also, there are hits and misses across the appetizers. I liked the smoky potato Rosti (despite not loving salmon roe), and the Pheasant Pastilla, but found the Octopus as the least thrilling version amongst peer restaurants (not least because of undercooked chickpeas).\n\nThe Hundred Dollar Chocolate Cake. Hmm... I liked it. But, the name inevitably sparks a conversation. I overheard one of the (delightful) servers jokingly tell a guest that there was a shredded hundred dollar bill inside. In an open auction, I'd probably pay $75 for the (chocolate, bourbon, coffee?) cake, and feel satisfied. Frankly, the accompanying glass of milk did nothing for me. I understand the chemistry and argue that it's the psychology instead: I never had cake with milk as a child, those who like it probably did. Having tried it 3 times, it's the chocolate ganache that brings it to life, and so if I were putting geometry to good use, I'd cut a right angle triangle from the sides with chocolate & the layer, and leave the rest... my point being: there's little depth, nuance, texture, anything really from the non-ganache part of the cake... The $100 price only makes sense from pricing desserts competitively to peers that charge $10 for a dessert.\n\nI also tried their hazelnut walnut pistachio baklava, and surprisingly loved it. They nailed the texture perfectly: when the fork makes contact with the Baklava, the flaky roof of the house doesn't slide off its nutty inhabitants nor does the basement get flooded (with syrup). Also, when the fork slices through the phyllo dough, you're supposed to hear the crunch - as was the case here.  I suspect the textural perfection was enabled by holding back just a tad on the syrup - a trade-off I can live with. The Baklava was accompanied by ice cream that was supposedly Pistachio and definitively vegan. \"Supposedly\" because you can contrast the taste with that of the real pistachio bits, and as to the vegan nature of the frozen dessert, to borrow the 'politeness' of the South: Bless Your Heart! ;)\n\nBrunch would be my favorite meal at Hungry Pigeon. You can get not just the exceptional egg & cheese sandwich, but also a host of well executed egg dishes. I loved the Potato & Broccolini Scramble, and particularly the accompanying sourdough bread drizzled with olive oil. I'd make a repeat trip just for their bread. Fantastic. Consistent. Reflective of their established baking credentials.\n\nThe ambience is quirky. I know it's described as evoking the feeling of eating at a friend's place. Sorry. I don't buy that. None of my friends is as talented in cooking, as these guys are. I do love their neighborhood restaurant feel, and it attracts a very different clientele than the other all-day dining restaurants in Philly. I say that in a positive sense, as despite the long waits for brunch, a lady who thought I'd been waiting longer, felt extremely guilty to be seated before me, and regretted repeatedly. I haven't seen that kind of graciousness lately.

I decided to get the suadero burrito, and for $7.00 you will definitely get your money's worth. This burrito was hefty. Filled with lots of meat, rice, and beans, this burrito will definitely fill you up. The suadero was cooked to perfection and was extremely flavorful throughout.

It was greasy from the fresh cheese and on top of that, you can get the meat of your choice. \n\nThe service and people inside the food truck were great! Although English did not seem like their first language, they understood my order and were quick to making the food. My only comment about the service is that the people inside need to speak up a little bit when calling out numbers/orders. I was there when there were only a few people left, so it wasn't much of a problem, but I could see it becoming a concern when people cannot hear their orders.

The first thing I noticed while scrolling through the pics on Yelp was how beautiful the food and cocktails were presented and captured by fellow Yelpers. I'm happy to say we had a lovely experience. We didn't have reservations so there was a slight wait in the 1 o'oclock hour. A great distraction while you wait is their gift shop/nursery attached to the cafe. The nursery houses a wide variety of various plants for purchase. \n\nOur waiter was Dylan S. whom was very knowledgeable, helpful and friendly. I was torn between several menu items from breakfast entres to sandwich options and a few cocktails. Dylan explained the cocktails and the differences in taste and he went over the menu with me, everything and I do mean everything he suggested was exceptional!! And this was true for our entire group. \n\nI ordered the Peach Bourbon Sour to begin, in which our waiter Dylan suggested. It was absolutely delicious!!! It was visually stunning and well concocted. All the ingredients meshed well together, not at all over powering, very light and refreshing. They are creating some amazing cocktails in this place. I highly recommend trying one of their cocktails or sparkling cocktails.\n\nAs for my entre, Dylan, suggested the Osage Scramble which was amazing. It included their hash with scrambled eggs on top with a side of toast and jam. The hash was made with potatoes, yellow squash and grilled onions. It was nicely seasoned.My eggs were perfectly scrambled, light and fluffy, not at all dry, hard or over cooked. The toast and jam were also amazing, not your ordinary run of the mill, plain old bread and spread. Ohhh no, not here, this was like multi grain bread with homemade jam. I also ordered a side of Nueske Bacon for the baby. I tried a strip of the bacon, which was thick cut with a nice flavor. I also tried their Brioche French Toast (soo good you can eat it without the syrup) and Chicken Sausage (well seasoned and juicy).\n\nI'm already planning a return visit with the BF and family.

Whether it's for cooking classes, team building activities, or catering services, it's a great way to enjoy a night out with loved ones or new acquaintances. Instead of the typical dinner at your everyday restaurant, why not go behind the scenes in a relaxed atmosphere and directly engage the Chef? Better yet, you'll find yourself cooking and picking up tips along the way. Chefs are vetted and come from a diverse range of culinary backgrounds. Hosted at their place or yours, you're able to choose from variety of experiences. \n\nThey've recently expanded to Philadelphia and Chef Renee Weigel is one of their brightest stars. She was awarded the James Beard Scholarship and will soon graduate from the Drexel Culinary Arts program. But don't let the fresh face fool you. Her experience in the restaurant industry starts from a young age. With local Pennsylvania Dutch roots, she's worked in numerous restaurants and has a passion for sustainable agriculture and sourcing ingredients from local farmers. She's also involved with LocalStove, which provides subscription-based meal prep planning or catering. \n\nFor CozyMeal, Chef Renee's base of operations is the open kitchen at Good Food Flats. With a gorgeous tablescape and place settings all ready, I knew all I had to do was pop open a bottle of wine and relax. After a brief introduction, Chef had us join in on the prep for the meal. My friend Sembat got to work on chopping up some shallots while I went after the onion. This was all for the base of a nice red sauce, with both fresh vine-ripened and canned tomatoes. Touch of sugar, salt, and herbs and it was good to go. There was also plenty left for us to take home in several jars! Chef Renee then cooked up some arborio rice to make risotto. With this cooled, we helped roll out some rice balls with bread crumbs, which were then deftly fried to give us our first course - arancini with homemade red sauce. Delicious! \n\nI was excited for our next dish. Having had Vetri's spinach gnocchi several times, I actually attempted a recreation a few months back. That was definitely a fail, with the gnocchi turning out rock hard. But having Chef Renee provide me with proper instruction, we were able to create a rustic and fluffy iteration, with ricotta and fresh spinach coming through. The browned butter and Parmesan helped to create a salty bite that was simply delicious. Definitely helped myself to seconds of this.\n\nFor dessert, a quick 15 to 20-minute baked olive oil cake was all we needed. Crispy on the outside and fluffy within, we had a lot of fun plating our own dishes. We even made homemade whipped cream and topped it all with powdered sugar and slivered orange slices. Bellisimo! \n\nBe sure to check out the CozyMeal options available in Philadelphia. Apart from the Italian Recipes cooking class with Chef Renee, she also has cooking classes for Dim Sum, Mexican, and French fare as well. CozyMeal is expanding quickly and appears to be a great way for folks to amp up date night or provide a creative way to host friends.", "date": "2018-02-25 20:17:11"}, {"_key": "10014079", "_id": "reviews/10014079", "_rev": "_fNzD0O2--D", "review_id": "ML9hL-TmksxAVOvyWq6dAA", "user_id": "sxwVQcMZkiez3R_442GkAQ", "business_id": "zmEFVIU5cakWga2cyskz2Q", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I personally haven't stayed here, but my friend's parents stayed here and I got to check out their room.

I got my water with lemon and my waitress was awesome, she gave me what was on draft, got me my beer pretty fast, was very knowledgeable in the food they served. I ended up getting the fried chicken Nashville got style and the peppered burger with fries. My food arrived pretty quick and the first thing I wanted to taste was that fried chicken. That was one of the best fried chicken Nashville hot style I have had and the best here in the area. Came with pickles and toast, the toast was actually pretty good. The chicken was sweet, crispy, spicy and hot!   This was so delicious I really didn't want to eat my burger. If you come here this is what I would recommend is the fried chicken Nashville hot style. Still thinking about it and wanting more now. The burger was very good, great combination of meat to bun with fresh ingredients. Love the flavor and taste of the burger. My fries are ok, they were kind of too soft and felt like they were stale, but I love potatoes and I couldn't eat my burger without fries. The food and the waitress that took care of me was really good at her Job and I felt like she was happy to work.

One of the things I love about QTG is that every production seems to involve a re-thinking of the audience seating arrangement and stage placement. So when you walk in, you never know what to expect - and often find the staging effects quite magical. Some scenes in Lear were staged in the original theater's lobby, Mother Courage had the audience seated where the stage is now for the series of Synge plays making up the Synge Festival (not to be missed!). My personal favorite production was - well, it's hard to say, so many are so memorable - Ibsen's The Wild Duck, or possibly Odets' Awake and Sing!, or Beckett's Waiting for Godot. And it's not all so serious, as they proved with the Goldoni-derived side-splitting farce, One Man, Two Guvnors.

I've never had a dish here I didn't love. The water is served from a tall glass and you have cups at the table to pour at your leisure. If you want ice, you have to ask (I normally do because the water is typically room temperature). My only disappointment is how expensive everything is.

I mean, I've been served within 5 minutes of ordering when eating in but to-go has never been less than a 30 minute wait once ordered. Again, the amazing food is worth the wait.

Even better, they are open late! \n\nColombians love their hamburgers, just not your typical hamburger.

Then came the pizzas! Ashley and I ordered a \"Sweetie Pie\", which was the signature Reno Bites special with Fresh Mozzarella, Stracchino, Red Onion, Sausage, Garlic, Asparagus and Sweety Drop Miniature Peppers, and we built our own with a tomato sauce base, bacon, soppresatta, onion, tomato, smoked mozz and ricotta. \n\nBoth were delicious! I loved the Sweetie Pie more than I thought I would, and even more than the pizza I'd built myself. The combo of the garlic and oil with the fresh veggies and sausage was awesome. I think the only thing that could have made this pie better would have been hand crumbled Italian sausage vs. the slices they use. I think that goes really well with the handmade product they produce.\n\nThe pizza we built was good, but I think it ended up a little heavy on the tomato sauce or too much moisture from the additional tomatoes we added, because the bottom of the crust was a little soggy. No matter, it was DELICIOUS! \n\nSouthcreek has a number of small plates and salads on their menu that I'm stoked to return to try. Specifically I'm after the wood fired mortadella, the meatballs, and I hear their ribs are something tasty too. They've had these items on their menu since they opened, so I'm excited to see what new items they choose to add in the near future.\n\nOne thing is certain, Southcreek is here to stay, and I for one am glad about that.

Pat has been one of our favorite servers, he introduced us to being able to split the Crab Cake meal for 2 and adding an additional salad, veggies, and potato pastry (my mouth is literally salivating at remembering these details) for only $6.  It's mind blowing.\nWe do not live near St. Pete Beach, but make the 45 min drive to get here, and usually head to the beach beforehand and make this stop after, and it's just something you don't forget easily, it's so incredibly amazing, if you are contemplating going, DO IT, now!

I want to take a huge jug of it home and eat salad everyday with it... and put it on sandwiches.. and with fish.. and chicken... put it on ALL THE THINGS!\nThen you get some fresh hummus for the table with these long cracker/flatbread pieces with sprinkled spices (cumin? not sure, I am not a spice expert) on top that you spread the chunky hummus on and it's super good!\nThen the main event comes out, and I want to cry it is so fabulously fantastic!  Don't waste your experience and get the super fried platter, the Fisherman's platter, you have got to experience one of their fresh, amazing platters with saut\u00e9ed mixed vegetables and their insanely incredible POTATO PASTRY! This creation is sent from the gods, seriously heavenly.  I get sad when I see people order fried fish n' chips platter that you see at every other restaurant.. it's the safe choice.. sure.. but you HAVE to get the dinners with the yummy veggies and this potato pastry creation, and whatever main part sounds delish to you.\n\nThey have an excellent Key Lime Pie with Raspberry drizzling, and I believe an Oreo crust?

You can buy freshly sliced meats and cheeses or pick some up from the case already cut. There are jars of tomato sauce, bottles and cans of olive oil,  fresh and frozen sections of prepared foods such as homemade raviolis etc. And it's all good.\n\nThey also make one of the best muffalettas in town stacked high with their freshly sliced ham and salami and topped with the best olive salad in New Orleans.

Overall, Kaffa Crossing has given me several dishes over the past few months that I haven't been able to stop thinking about. Unlike nearby ethio places, their meat is seasoned and oiled to perfection, without any extra grease or unneeded heaviness. The lamb is boneless, which was new to me, and the spice level on it when I said \"make it spicy\" did not disappoint. The derek tibs are filled with so much meat, so many peppers, and the pieces are so chewy like I always want for dried beef tibs. \n\nThe injera here is super sour, which is also a plus over a few others. They also have lentil rolls, both the spicy and the yellow lentils, for 3.50 that can fill you up if you aren't feeling meat or other veg. The vibe here is relaxing and focused on the dishes.

When I went, their unique flavor was Island Banana. It was actually really good! The other flavor that surprised me was Peanut Butter. Peanut Butter is pretty common at most froyo places, so I have tried my fair share of PB froyo (I shamelessly taste test almost every single flavor before going with my beloved tart) and usually, it tastes a little artificial to me. I'm always disappointed by PB at other businesses because I am a peanut butter fanatic and automatically assume that I'll appreciate any PB flavored dessert. Here, it was shockingly good. It tasted exactly how I would envision peanut butter froyo to taste. Kudos to Yogulatte for being the first froyo place in my experience to get that right!\n\nTheir selection of toppings are also on the lesser side, but what they have is money. I go ham on chocolatey toppings, so I attacked the heath/reese's/snickers/kit kat/butterfingers. They had most of the major chocolate bars!

First off, all the ingredients in their food is high quality. From the fresh crisp salads with a large variety of toppings, down to the dough they use for the pizza and croutons, Marco's gets it right. I usually go with one of two items: A personal Cheezy White pizza or their meatball bake with a side of cheezy bread and garden salad (that I split with my boyfriend). No other pizza place has the unique Cheezy White that Marco's has. Where do I begin what I love about it?? Well, for one, no red sauce, but it has fresh tomatoes, feta cheese, and bacon. The flavor combo is incredible. The meatball bake with cheezy bread as the side is basically a deconstructed meatball pizza, but I'm okay with that.  I like to use the red sauce (I normally hate red sauce, but I love theirs because of the bold robust flavor, not watered down or sweet like some other sauces) to tip the thick buttery cheezy bread. Their salads are decent too if you want to try to be a little healthy. Their garden salad has a generous amount of black olives, green peppers, tomatoes, and onions, with cheddar cheese to complete it.

My second party member for the tacu salad- which surprisingly came with a rice base and not a salad base. The third party member got the Chafu. Both received generous portions; each of them took over half their meal home with them. I ordered the Naked Peruvian wrap. This also came with a side; I ordered the plantains.

I took the second half of the wrap home. \n\nTwo notes to consider. 1) The herbal limeade is very good, however, I diluted it 2/3 waters for every 1/3 of the limeade. Honestly, it was just too intense without the dilution. The staff said that there are several cups of sugar I the mix- so beware. 2) one of my guests orders a churro to go. She loves churros! Unfortunately, she was not feeling Viva Chicken's version. While she shared that the dough was delicious, she did not like the caramel center of the warmed churro. \n\nFinally, I appreciated the overall accessibility of the venue. The location had tables and rows that accommodates individuals with mobility needs. The bathrooms were also very spacious and included an accessible sink and door. The only area of growth seemed to be their self-help stations.

I loved the food here.  \n\nOn Mondays and Tuesdays, they have half priced bottles of wine.  The selection looked good and reasonably priced.  However, it was 17 degrees outside, so the hot Turkish tea (black tea from Turkey, in case you're wondering) really hit the spot.  And I loved that it was served with a sugar cube.  There's something so adorably fancy about sugar cubes.  But I digress.  Onto the food!  Do you ever hear a food combination and think -- ok, that will either be gross or superb?  That was one of our dishes, and it was SUPERB.  Donor (gyro) meat with a tomato sauce similar to the one for Greek-style green beans.  Then topped with yogurt sauce sans cucumbers.  And underneath the yogurt sauce, chunks of fried pita bread that somehow managed to stay crispy under all that sauce.  It was a perfect marriage of ingredients.  Best of all for a carnivore like me, it came topped with a couple small chunks of roasted pepper, but other than that, it was all meat and bread.  Perfect!\n\nWe had also hedged our bets by getting the regular donor platter to share.  It came with meat (no sauce), rice, and vegetables (green beans, carrots, and maybe squash?).  It was good, but didn't hold a candle to the donor in yogurt.  The vegetables were flavorful, but the rice was forgettable.  The meat was seasoned very well and was moist.  \n\nWe started the meal with the phyllo wrapped feta straws.  They were good, but I probably would not get them again, just because the free pitas and oil were so good, and I want to save room to try dessert next time.  The pitas are served with an olive oil containing tiny bits of fresh red bell pepper, black pepper, and oregano.  We could have drunk a bottle of the oil.  \n\nThe only downside of the meal was the service.  I would not call it bad so much as non-existent.  The restaurant was dead when we arrived (literally, we were the only ones there).  Still, it took a bit to get someone to the table.  Throughout the meal, we only saw our server (the owner, I believe) once or twice.  He was very nice when he came over, but we had to keep flagging him down and there were long intervals where he was in the back unavailable.  Hire and extra server and this would be a five-star rating.  \n\nTwo main dishes (with enough leftovers for one lunch the next day), and appetizer, pitas and oil, and two free hot teas (with refills): about $45.", "date": "2015-01-14 12:32:15"}, {"_key": "10018305", "_id": "reviews/10018305", "_rev": "_fNzD0g---R", "review_id": "CQv8Fv8zouTcexfiR9sh-w", "user_id": "AVS5IU5l93atKbpYry7e6A", "business_id": "FyDQ8QKKjmBKagZ2GhNb8Q", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Stumptown is hands down my favorite coffee shop in the CBD, and possibly my favorite in all of New Orleans.

Tucked inside Hyde Park, it's a quaint restaurant that offers an excellent assortment of French food, pastries, and nearly all day brunch.\n\nMy favorite item on the menu is the moules et fFrites. \"Mussels with Leeks, white wine & cream; finished with Pernod, garlic, butter & lemon. Served with Pommes Frites\" is delicious and is a table favorite. \n\nThe other items I have tried on the menu seem great but were ultimately OK to me. As a lover of eggs benedict, I tried both of Piquant's eggs bennies, and I hate to say that I dislike them so much. They're much too sweet for me, and I blame it on the lemon-thyme scone. The duck and waffles were bland, and fried duck for breakfast did not sit well with me.\n\nI recommend sticking to appetizers to try a little bit of everything or ordering an iced Nutella latte and pastries while seated on the patio. Piquant's outdoor seating has to be my favorite outdoor seating anywhere in Tampa. On a day of good weather, the wait to have one of the tables on the patio overlooking Hyde Park has a longer wait than sitting inside.\n\nAlthough I don't love everything on Piquant's menu, it's still one of my favorite places in Tampa.

The flavors, however, were no where near as dark, rich or bold as a short rib should taste.  There were certainly some good parts, the sides were above average but the overall meal was way sub par.  \nMy date ordered the pork and it too came with out of sight sides but the pork was dry and flavorless.

I am afraid \"average home cook\" is benchmark I hope to attain. \n\nI went in with my list of spices and herbs for my contribution to the Reno Cookbook Club (Haricots Verts A La Provencal from the classic Mastering the Art of French Cooking). I had walked by the shop a number of times on way to somewhere else and have always wanted to stop in. \n\nMy husband (who is an above average home cook) and I entered the lovely little shop and were hit by the tantalizing aroma of spices and herbs and hints of far away exotic locales.

I picked the jars of spices that I needed and Lindy helped walk me through the process while Brent weighed and measured my purchases. No, I could not buy just one bay leaf and just a teaspoon of Thyme, but I could get 0.5 ounce which was doable, Great bargain. Instead of buying a jar of God-knows-how-old-this-is spice at the grocery for $4 - $5, I can buy very fresh, high quality product for a fraction of the cost. \n\nThey also had little cloth pouches for the \"herb bouquet\" that can be washed and reused a gazillion times. Oh steady my heart. Am I actually going to get to the point that I see a USE for \"herb bouquet\"?

The service was very good. We were seated right away. Fun atmosphere. Cajun fries were not spicy at all but what can you do? I think they might make them less spicy for tourists but the Cajun fries I've gotten at Five Guys had more flavor. All in all a very good food experience.

Gym staff provides guidance and supervision for some fo the kids to do some cool tricks\n2. Kids ages 2 - 7 will LOVE this place\n3. Safety is key\n4. They have a parking lot for guests \n5.

Each bay allows for 6 golfers so we had to split our group. No big deal for us. All in all, I think we waited about 45 mins to get 1 bay and about an hour for the 2nd. Please note, they have no obligation to get you bays side by side when you have large parties, we just happened to luck out and have two open beside each other. I loved the drinks. Tried the \"Topgolf Margarita\" and it was delicious! Only food I tried were the tater tots and they weren't bad.

I enjoy seeing what all the fuss is about with certain restaurants. \n\nUpon entering the beautiful building (seriously beautiful, $6 million went into the renovation), I was hit with a restaurant loaded with hustle and bustle and glitz galore. I instantly felt like this was a destination restaurant not to be missed. As myself and fellow Tampa Bay Bloggers were whisked away to the upstairs area, I couldn't help but take in all the aromas of steak and char-grilled goodness. The cuisine at Ulele is American inspired Indian, but really focuses on fresh local cuisine indigineous to the Florida.\n\nOur first sample of Ulele came in the form of samples of craft beer. Tim Shackton, head brewmaster of Ulele's microbrewery, is known for creating delightful crisp lagers and on this evening I had the chance to sample his Honeymoon beer, a black lager, and a bourbon barrel aged red. Our waiter was gracious enough to recommend the bourbon barrel aged red and I really loved the caramel and vanilla from the barrel that came through, yet it was still full of biting hops.\n\nThe water they use for brewing their beer (a high-tech filtration system) is actually the water they use to serve patrons at the dinner table. The water comes in glass water bottles original from the Columbia Restaurant, dating back to 1905.\n\nThe first dish to arrive at our table came in the form of freshly shucked raw oysters on the half shell served with freshly grated horseradish and quartered lemon pieces. These were super fresh and I could've eaten a dozen easy. Here is a pro tip, I later received a bottle of datil pepper sauce to try out and I wish I had that bottle while enjoying some of these oysters. That was followed up with a platter of char-broiled oysters. There were simple and delicious. I enjoyed that there was not a gloppy mess of cheese atop the oysters and they had that great char flavor from the broiler.\n\nNext up, I enjoyed the alligator hushpuppies (alligator, country ham, duck bacon, fresh corn, jalape\u00f1o, honey datil pepper sauce and fresh-ground horseradish aioli). While not entirely a new idea, these were well-executed bites of crunchy goodness.\n Ulele blog event-9As the food train kept marching along, I enjoyed a crunchy bite of squash gratin. The veggies were cooked quite well, not mush, yet not raw. I adored the crunchy breadcrumb and manchego mixture atop the vegetables.\n\nNow on to the carnivorous portion of our segment. What I enjoyed next, and I do mean enjoy, is a hefty 10 ounce portion of perfectly seared wet-aged filet mignon. The filet was accompanied by fresh asparagus and a mound of white cheddar popcorn mashed potatoes.\n\nTaking a brief break from beef, I had the pleasure of noshing on some fresh pan-seared pompano topped with fried carrot ribbons all set atop a mound of wild rice and a drizzle of sundried tomato shallot cream. This could be my favorite dish from the evening. I absolutely loved the fried carrot ribbons.\n\nThat was quick break and now back to the beef. This mammoth of a steak is the kilo porterhouse, coming in at a whopping 2.2 lbs. This too had great char on the meat and a great steak quality that I absolutely loved. The extra fat in these cuts always lends to great flavor.\n\nSwoon. That's what I did when dessert hit the table. Candied Duck Bacon Maple Fried Ice Cream (cinnamon corn flake candied duck bacon crust, Knob Creek cr\u00e8me anglaise, caramel, sweet potato waffle crisp). This was definitely the bees knees and if I wanted to eat whatever the hell I wanted everyday, this would end each and every night for me.\n\nDo yourself a favor and get down to Ulele, fast.

He said the portion in the cup was actually much larger than the bread bowl. At first he thought the soup had soaked into the bread, but when he got into it it looked like they just hadn't scooped out enough bread to make a decent bowl size. So, skip the bread bowl. \n\nFor my entree I had the steak salad. It was pretty good, the steak was peppery and cooked the way I wanted it. \n\nThe real bummer on our second visit was the service.

The trees and plants are gorgeous, the walkways are clean, the bathrooms are as clean as you can expect when thousands of people are using them, the animals and coasters are well cared for, the staff is generally friendly, there are lots of shows, etc. - happy happy happy\n\n(3) The animals: these little (and big) guys are probably why this is my favorite park - combining two of my favorite things (roller coasters and animals) was GENIUS.  The habitats are really nice - you don't feel sorry for any of the animals at this park - and there are lots of learning opportunities for the little (and big) ones in your group.\n\n(4) The food: man I don't know what it is about the Desert Grill, but that turkey sandwich with potato salad drives me crazy!

While Yelp makes this obvious (if you're paying attention), Google does not, and we quickly became frustrated trying to figure out where this place was located. There is no clear signage near the road for this restaurant. \n\nAs for the restaurant itself, we'd probably come back if someone was craving it, but I wasn't blown away by the establishment. With the high prices come fantastic presentation (in both food and decor), though, so if you're looking for something that feels a bit like a treat, BRGR is a decent place to check-out.\n\nPROS:\n-Being located in a hotel really helps their views and ambiance. If you're seated outdoors, you'll enjoy the nice beach-side breeze and an open view of their interior courtyard. If you're seated indoors, you'll enjoy a quiet, well-chilled atmosphere with modern decor and comfortable seats. \n-Fantastic variety of seating. There are outdoors and indoor couches and chairs - perfect for drinks-only or light finger foods. There are indoor and outdoor tables that will be great for eating full meals. There is an indoor bar seating area as well. It just depends on what you want. \n-Our server was really nice. We were outside - which definitely meant that we were harder to keep an eye on - but he did a good job refilling drinks. When he accidentally spilled a bit of our drink on the ground before serving it, he apologized profusely and got us another one. He did a very good job. \n-Parking for the restaurant right under the building. You won't have to fight to find a spot. It's free for restaurant-goers too. \n-Lovely food presentation. A bit of extra time and thought has been put forward to present your ordered food in a lovely, good-looking manner. \n-Their ranch is absolutely fantastic. While I wasn't in love with their fries, I really loved their ranch, so the french fries worked as wonderful \"ranch delivery foods\".\n\nCONS:\n-Finding this place is a nightmare. I had no idea it was located within a hotel, and it took us a lot of guessing to figure out how to find it. It's on the second floor of the Treasure Island Beach Resort. While this gives it a lovely beach-side location to occupy, it also makes it a pain to find. There was no clear signage to make it easy for tourists to find.\n-My burger was particularly dry. My tablemate loved his, and he said it was moist and cooked-as-ordered. Mine was definitely overcooked and light on the toppings. \n-When seated outdoors, the soda options come in a relatively small glass (12 ounces?). When partnered with ice, that's pretty little soda, so if you don't have a good wait person who regularly checks in on you, I could see this being a frustrating purchase.", "date": "2018-07-17 19:19:45"}, {"_key": "10019567", "_id": "reviews/10019567", "_rev": "_fNzD0kq--D", "review_id": "aAX4WYs0Tbunw-FGlsIfkg", "user_id": "q_dZIvQMsaidgHJN_tqfBw", "business_id": "qnlupHx2Oyle1fQtxDeeRQ", "stars": 3, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I can here yesterday (Saturday) early evening, and had an okay experience.

We've had him before and he is absolutely excellent. He knows  everything about the menu, his timing is impeccable, and he is very friendly. 6 thumbs up (there were 3 of us dining!) for Vince. Now, onto the food!  The 3 of us shared the lobster ravioli (the appetizer special) which had a delicious sauce that I believe was made from green peas. OMG, I would have ordered it as an entree if I could have, it was SOOO good. We also had the lobster and shrimp spring rolls, which were served with a garlic chili sauce and were to die for.  Moving on to dinner my dad had a turkey Rachael sandwich and the tomato soup (which was the soup of the day) and he loved it. Vince said they roast the turkey in house, so no lunch meat, and my dad said it was delish. I stole a few fries and they are perfectly crispy. My mom and I couldn't decide what we wanted, so we each got a separate entree from the regular menu and split them.  This was a great choice because every bite on both plates was incredible! She had the tilapia, which has a lemon butter sauce, sauteed spinach, and a layered sweet potato gratin which was really unique and delicious!   The fish was perfectly cooked and the sauce complimented it well. Mmmm.  My dinner, the mixed grill, was nothing short of spectacular. It had 4 perfectly cooked sea scallops, 3 shrimp, 3 juicy lamb lollipops, mashed potatoes, and hericot verts in a light coconut sauce. It was positively to die for!  Every bite was just amazing. This dish is pricey ($31), but it was absolutely worth it. I am glad my mom shared with me because it was a lot of food and I couldn't (well, I  could have, but shouldn't have) eaten it all on my own.

I couldn't help but think of Alla Spina - coincidentally and conveniently located near us as well! More importantly, it's one of my favorite places to grab a drink or brunch. \n\nDimly lit at night, it's a great spot to pop a seat at the bar or grab a secluded table with some friends or a date. \n\nNegroni [$11]\nBluecoat gin, campari, sweet vermouth\n\nReally smooth with a wonderfully prototypical bitter and citrus finish. The Negronis here are done right and on tap!\n\nSgroppino [$11]\nProsecco, Tito's vodka, lemon sorbet\n\nThe sgroppino featured light effervescence, with a saccharine lemon foam brought on by the prosecco and lemon sorbet. Sweet enough to enjoy just one.\n\nBuffalo Chicken Deviled Eggs [$1.50 pp]\n\nWe got a few of the deviled eggs which had nice buffalo chicken essence with a bit of spicy kick.\n\nCrispy Pig Tails [$8]\nFennel agrodolce\n\nI loved the gluttonous fatty bits, encasing the tender fall-apart pork from the tail bone. The sweet and sour agrodolce played well with the anise flavors of the fennel to bring forth some balance to the richness of the pork.\n\nFried Pickles [$8]\nJulie's ranch dressing\n\nI normally enjoy fried pickles best when they're shaved as thin chips. But these were well-battered - not overly thick, surprisingly crisp, and held onto the briny spears. The ranch dressing wasn't overwhelming and had a nice cooling essence that complemented the saltiness of the pickles.\n\nCauliflower Grits [$10]\nOld bay, cheddar\n\nEven for the vegetarians, there's a home for you at Alla Spina. The cauliflower was well-charred and tender. The grits were buttery, cheesy, and rich, with the Old Bay providing sharp hits of seasoning.\n\nBlack Bean Nachos [$14]\nBeer cheese, pico de gallo\n\nThese black bean nachos are the perfect snack to complement a brew. The housemade tortilla chips were overloaded with cotija and thick black beans to create a homey and filling bite. The pickled jalapenos and scallions helped to brighten up each bite.\n\n\"The Angry Grandpa\" Double Decker Burger [$14]\nGuanciale, provolone, samurai ranch, fried pickle, LTO\n\nFor those in the know, the burger is clearly a reference to Chef Vetri's social media alter ego. Regardless, there's nothing but love here. Nicely crisped double patty's were straight from the flattop. Interspersed with thinly sliced onions, fresh tomatoes, lettuce, and crisp guanciale, the spattering of samurai ranch tied each bite together. Somehow the sesame seeded bun housed it all in. The fried pickle spear on top? Heaven. My choice of sour cream n' onion chips were spot on - easily addictive and should supplement any drink you might have on hand.\n\nDrunk a Roos [$6]\nCookies, whisky icing \n\nAn ode to a favorite childhood treat, these were cute in essence, but as you might expect, nothing to write home about. The whisky essence was a bit lost amidst the sweet icing, but I suppose that's not really the point, is it?\n\nKey Lime Pie Twist [$6]\nGraham cracker crumble\n\nOn the other hand, the key lime pie twist was a clear winner. This was essentially key lime pie ice cream, topped with plenty of Graham cracker crumbles. The tart essence of the key lime inundated each spoonful and was the perfect palate cleanser.\n\nAs expected with any Vetri production, our server Alecia was extremely knowledgeable, offering tidbits about the drinks list and plenty of recommendations about the menu.

I think their walls were painted blue as well though I recall it being more robin's egg blue than turquoise...was debating if it was left over from them or if they repainted? I am not sure if blue is really the best color or not for them, but I also rarely know anything about interior decorating so I am probably the last person to ask! ;P The Boutique was a women's clothing shop and also sold some children's clothing and other misc gifts. I actually really liked shopping there and I am sad they had to move (her husband got a job in FL, so they moved.) \n(That bit was mostly for people who were wondering what happened to It Boutique...!)\n\nBUT that aside, when I saw this place had opened up in their old spot, I decided it would be worth it to take a look. I love ice cream, soda, candy, and  SOMETIMES even gooey butter cakes despite their insane sweetness...the flavored ones are generally more tolerable than just plain. \n\nThey installed a soda/icecream /bar thing, where customers can sit and enjoy their desserts. The layout seems strange but probably only because I was so used to coming in here and seeing other things previously. I probably just need to get adjusted to it, although it SEEMS like they could rearrange things to make better use of the space. I think they need more tables and less nic-nacs but that's just me. \n\nI looked over their menu and decided I wanted to get a white choco raspberry soda thingy with ice cream. (Ice Cream Soda I think it's called.) But I noticed they only came in 20 oz sizes. Thankfully the woman behind the counter (the owner maybe??) was verrry kind and allowed me to get half the size for half the price. Awesome! Not many people do that. I think they should make \"kiddie\" sizes of their normal stuff too, so that way health-conscious 'grown-ups' can still come here and enjoy something without paying $6 or $7 for a drink they'e going to drink less than half of and then throw away. :(\n\nWhen I tried it, it had a good flavor but let's just say it was a non-homogeneous mixture and I found that the ice cream was stuck to the bottom of the cup in a big clump and the fizzy syrup part was kind of more towards the top. I don't understand why they didn't use a blender but maybe I just don't get what an \"ice cream soda\" is supposed to be. Maybe they served it correctly. It just tasted weird to me because I would get only sips of fizzy sugary syrup and then occasional icecream, so I had to grab the spoon she gave me and physically mix the concoction myself to get it to be even throughout. Maybe it was my fault for asking for a smaller size. I don't know.\n\nI think I would like to go back here and try their other things like gooey butter cake. I am also curious as to where they get their ice cream from. It was pretty good. I wonder if it's local? Their gooey butter cakes are baked in house. They also have candy for sale. It's a cute endeavor and I would like to see them succeed but I think they need to tweak things a bit and maybe get a more extensive menu. Nothing about my trip made me \"crave\" more from them, but in fairness it was only my first trip!! Service was overall friendly and I am glad to see their family all working together like that.\n\nThis review is stuck between 3 and 4 stars I wish I could give 3 and a half, but Yelp doesn't do that yet. I suspect my next trip will solidify whether it's 3 or 4 and repeat trips will help me determine if it's a 5. \n\nPS: I see that there are 11 filtered reviews.... just as a suggestion to the owners of this place, it's not a good a idea to write yourself a bunch of 4 and 5 star reviews on Yelp. And I'm not trying to say they did....but it just looks kind of suspicious because they all cropped up right around the same time.

I also had to call to tell them we were running behind, and they were able to accommodate us.\n\nIt's a cute little place that's easily missed (we drove right by it) and takes up two separate but adjacent locations.  There's the main dining room, and next door is an area for large private dinners.  The restroom is also in this annex.  While this could be a dressy place, we were comfortable in casual clothes... I mean nice jeans and shirts, not slumming it or anything.  We were seated in the patio area, which was protected by a canopy and rain/wind screen and was heated, so the chilly night wasn't a problem.\n\nService, as mentioned, is very good, though some may find it somewhat intrusive.  We had 2 busboys tripping over themselves to make sure we were watered, and the wait staff worked as a team, with our waiter taking being our primary caretaker and others checking in to make sure we had ordered or had our questions answered.\n\nThe food is good, but should have been better... while the flavors were there, I needed to add salt to everything.  I was a little disappointed that a place like this doesn't offer sea salt on the table.\n\n- Roasted Wild Mushrooms: I love mushrooms, and these were done very well.  But also, this dish needed the most salt... they tasted perfect after I sprinkled some on.  \n\n- Seared foie gras: Very tasty, just a tad bit more livery than I like, but that's fine (not so much for my tablemate).  \n\n- Braised short rib: Tender, succulent, flavorful, moist... the way a braised short rib should be!  But the winner here is the white truffle polenta..... it tasted wonderful, and I couldn't stop eating it.\n\n- Seared Salmon: It must have been a special that night.  On the menu it was indicated as being cooked to medium rare and that's how it came out.  My dining companion didn't like it that way but wanted to power through it.  When our server came and asked how we were, he could tell that she wasn't happy, and to his credit he further inquired and made her feel comfortable about bringing it back and cooking it well done (she's not very confrontational about such things).  It came back out, replated, and she was satisfied.  She still wasn't thrilled by it, but she figured it was probably because of the 2x cooking.  The salmon came with wilted spinach and beluga lentils... the lentils were definitely not my cup of tea, and polluted the other items on the plate.

This is really the worst bowl of pho, I've ever had. The beef tasted like it had been previously frozen, even a bit of freezer burn aftertaste. By the time I neared the bottom of the bowl, the broth began to taste like dirty dishwater. And while I truly don't know what dirty dishwater tastes like, that's the first thing that came to my mind.

We think it is awesome fun to see if the changes he made stayed implemented or if the restaurant has gotten better or swerved downhill.\n\nWe were New Orleans back in October of 2014 and decided to take advantage of being close to Oceana, which was featured on Season 4 of Kitchen Nightmares.  Understandably, I was a bit put off, because this one was one of the worst episodes I recall watching with a disgusting kitchen, a rat problem (like many of the restaurants in the Quarter, being so close to the Gulf, it's a real issue) and of course, one of the first to make the notorious Brit throw his guts up.  It should have been a warning to us to stay the hell away.  However, when our key card to our hotel room at the Inn on St. Peters featured this restaurant on it, we said, what the hell...let's do it.\n\nSo glad we did.  The changes made to restaurants decor stayed exactly as they had been at the end of the show.  It was absolutely beautiful and clean.  Even the ladies room was immaculate.  \n\nWe ordered drinks.  My husband got a \"Greyhound\" and I had a Lemon Drop martini.  They were absolutely delicious, decently priced and served in large glasses.  For our appetizer, we ordered the Oyster's Rockerfeller and without a doubt, they were the BEST OR's I have ever eaten in my life.  So good in fact, that I ordered them again as my main course!  They are competitively priced based on the area and season at $10.50 for a half dozen and $17.50 for a dozen.  I don't know what the sauce was that was on it, but I could have had it in a bowl as a soup, it was that good.  My husband had the Praline Duck which he described as \"Delicious\" (as food was hanging from his mouth, mind you).  This was a slow simmered praline and rum sauce over the duck with a side of fresh steamed vegetables and roasted garlic potatoes.  \n\nAlso had a side of crawfish tails ($5.00) to pick on while waiting on the food.  The food wait time was scarcely 15 minutes.  Dessert for hubs was the bananas foster cake which smelled incredible.  I had a creme brulee that brought tears to my eyes, it was so fabulous. ($5.00 each)\n\nThe place was packed, but everyone looked happy and the place smelled fantastic.  There was a real sense of NOLA fun here, the wait staff was very attentive and super friendly.  The patrons were all talking with each other at various tables.  It was just a really fun atmosphere.  Yes, they were giving out cards for a YELP review and to mention your servers name, but it was for a sweepstakes for the STAFF...not a free drink for the customers \"bribing\" them for good reviews, so whoever wrote that is full of it.  So, thank you, Earl, for making us have a great experience.\n\nSide note:  I am DEATHLY allergic to nuts. All kinds of nuts.  Walnuts, Pralines, Peanuts, Almonds, Cashews, etc.  The staff members all gathered around me, including the chef and managers to make sure they all talked about NO cross contamination, make my food away from other foods and a clean cutting board and using fresh utensils for cutting and carving.  One even mentioned that they have an EPI pen in their first aid kit in case I didn't have one.  I am always super impressed with a restaurant that knows how serious food allergies can be.  They took it very seriously and made me feel super comfortable.\n\nSo congrats, Chef Ramsey!  Oceana continues to be one of your best success stories in the French Quarter.\n\nPS?

The open space, while definitely bigger, feels smaller, because there are no more nooks and posts to congregate around.  \n\n3.

I felt like this business was mainly based in the dish on his sauce and personally I'm not really big on that. The sauce is okay but not anything unique or different than what is currently being offered at other similar establishments. More disappointing and worth noting was the crab cakes that I received this Monday. I was very disappointed to see that they were using imitation crab in their crab cakes. Because they offer Seafood I thought that they will be able to offer eight good crab cake however it was mostly breaded with pieces of stuffing or comparable to dressing or stuffing. Then pieces of imitation crab was throughout. The reason I knew was imitation crab was because there was a roll of imitation crab left where I could see them atation crab meat.

You could tell a grand opening was going on and everyone was excited about trying all of the new food and drinks. I started off with some chargrilled oysters which were the absolute best I've had so far (O.K., this was only the second time I had them in my life, but they were so tasty!) They were only $1 each for a half dozen which was a great deal for the grand opening.\n\nNext it was time for an appetizer, and the Mid-City Buffalo wings did not disappoint. These were big, juicy chicken wings glazed with spicy buffalo sauce and creamy ranch on the side. An 8 piece was the perfect size, since many places I know only give about 5 wings for an appetizer.\n\nBut by far my favorite part of this delicious food experience at The Banks was the Banks Street Burger. 8oz of pure C.A.B. ground chuck, short rib and brisket mixed together to create the best damn burger I've had in a while. It was fully dressed with lettuce, tomato and pickle, served on a brioche bun which pulled everything together so nicely. The french fries were seasoned to perfection. \"Real french fries!\" as my mother called them once she took a bite; us New Orleanians don't like fries unless they're bigger than shoestrings and seasoned more than Ronald McDonald ever could. These were indeed, \"real fries\".\n\nAside from the food, the Summer Originals cocktails are what will have me coming back to this spot as well. I tried two of them, The Crowley: mezcal, lime juice, orange juice, passion fruit syrup, angostura bitters, coconut cream (pinkish in hue, sweet in flavor!) and the Elder Bull: Absolut vanilla, St. Germain, Regan's orange bitters, lemon juice, simple syrup, Red Bull\u2063 (light yellow, lightly sweet; the Absolut vanilla really shows out in this drink) I loved the cocktails!! Not only were they delish but they looked so cute and since they were complimentary with the grand opening, you could pick from a list of them to try.\n\nOverall, I love this spot and I can't wait to come back, lounge on the rooftop and sip more of these cocktails and order more oysters.

Over the years, I've gotten to know Benjamin Moore's hues and names of paint colors, but then I started to familiarize myself with Sherwin Williams, and then, Dunn Edwards happened to me. Will it be worth getting to know another paint company and their pigments?\n\nDunn Edwards is unique because they specialize in homes primarily in the southwest. Think CA, AZ, Nevada'ish. The reason? They've found that just like wood, paint acclimatizes to r\u00e9gions due to weather and temperature. They wanted to excel in a certain region and provide the very best paint instead of offering a paint for every region. No, we don't get massive snowstorms and humidity in Santa Barbara, but we do get a lot of sunshine and sea air. Now, I'm interested.\n\nI browsed the finishes of the paints and was surprised at the elegant colors and pigments they had to offer. Maybe you won't find a trendy Pinterest roll on Dunn Edwards interior design colors (there are some out there though),  but you will find the highest quality paint. These people are obsessed with their batch formulation that if they receive a raw material that doesn't fit the bill, they refuse to use it. It's like going to a Michelin Star restaurant where the chef only uses and sources the best ingredients. They are heavy on research for the health of people and the environment. \n\nI also love how un-crowded the store is. There's ample parking and there's not a huge line of people! I received a generous sample in a Velvet finish (oh my gosh, yum), and I was so excited about painting that it didn't feel like a chore, but rather a joy due to the ease of application and rich pigment. Every girl knows there's a difference between MAC makeup vs. Covergirl, right? This is a similar experience, the pigment is top notch.\n\nMy house has the ugliest finished color imaginable. The color looks like inside a baby diaper. I don't feel like painting the entire house right now but painting an accent color has helped turn something from baby poo to a happy baby poo. That little bit of happy came from Dunn Edwards in \"Arctic Paradise.\" I'll be adding four more colors using a split complimentary theme to create a harmonious and happy home until I'm ready for a bigger remodel.

Fried Pickles is one of my new addictions and when I see them on a menu, I order them. These were the first that did not impress me. We both thought that they were heavy on the breading, which killed the dill pickle taste. They came with a TK dipping sauce that I found to be flavorless.

They could have been a little crisper, but they still were the perfect side to my Pastrami. \n\nThe BF enjoyed the Southern Fried Salad. It had big chunks of chicken tenders tossed with Iceberg lettuce in a Ranch dressing. Ordering a salad at a place that primarily serves pub grub is crazy.

And you know what? It was not that bad!\n\n I ordered the Miso ramen because a friend that I came with had the Tonkatsu one and did not enjoy it. The bowl that came out was humungous and with a nicely looked soft boiled egg. When you order their ramen, they ask you how you liked your noodles cooked (al dente, soft, etc.). I thought that was a nice touch since I've never been asked that before. I ordered al dente noodles and while they were cooked more than al dente, it was not over cooked either. Overall noodle texture was pretty good. I don't normally order Miso ramen because it tends to be a bit too strong in flavor and salt for me but Ramen Boy's version was surprisingly bland. I wouldn't say even in a bad way because it was similar to the flavor I'd expect of shoyu ramen which I generally enjoy more. All it really needed was a bit of the chili sprinkles (which wasn't spicy but added more depth and saltiness). The bowl was also served with large pieces of chicken and corn inside. I definitely did not care for the chicken and if I return, I'll order the miso one again but with the pork that's normally in the Tonkatsu.\n\nI also tried the pork gyoza, which were just typical of Asian restaurants so no complaints there. \n\nDecor is very cute and it really does give you the same feel as other ramen places. I especially love the butt groove in the stools LOL. The servers were also very nice and friendly. Our waitress accidentally thought I ordered a combo instead of just a bowl (because everyone else at my table did) and when she came out with the gyoza, she immediately apologized and took it off our bill. The kitchen ended up giving me the gyoza for free anyway. \n\nOverall, I thought it was a decent attempt at being the first ramen place and I'm guessing they've improved since their grand opening.

It's more along the lines of Indian-essenced OIL.  Mmm mmm good???\nYes I bemoan that Indian food is in very rare form in New Orleans, so I understand how Salt N Pepper can thrive.  Nonetheless,  it was just sooo incredibly oily and greasy, nearly 24 hours later, my body is still threatening to revolt and just kill me off.  \nI should insert this disclaimer - I hale from Sugar Land and Houston, Texas - both places dense with South Indian people and restaurants.  A good few of my Indian friends had stupendously awesome authentic Indian-food-cooking parents.  So as you can imagine I've had some really excellent Indian food and I don't like settling, at least in this regard. \nOkay to Salt N Pepper's credit - it is very vegan friendly - they cook with oil, A LOT OF OIL (am I getting my point across?).  The counter guy who takes your order is super friendly and accommodating.  \nWe ended up with the Channa Masala, Aloo Gobi, and Saag Paneer (yes it has cheese, it was for my companion, but it was called something else - the Northern version name?).  Also two vegetable samosas, naan (allegedly vegan if you ask them not to slather the butter on it) and some basmati rice. \nAll the entrees came with some pathetic little salad and raita - to cool your palate with, I assume.  Nice touch, but I would've just preferred a larger entree (the entrees are enough for two, but not enough for leftovers, boo!).  The channa - very spicy, but not very flavorful and mushy!  Same with the Aloo gobi - and it was mostly oil . . . and might as well been some perversion of lower carb mashed potatoes - sooo overcooked.  The saag seemed okay, but no rave reviews were reported.  Now the samosas were okay, VERY spicy, but again, not too flavorful?  The rice was perfectly fluffy, naan was dense, fluffy, but a little dry.\nSo anyway this was very mediocre, maybe below mediocre - in that I can make better Indian food than this (and I suck at it).  (EDIT:  I actually just made aloo gobi and it was about 249823048 times better and I don't expect to spend all tonight in the bathroom, hurray!  Sorry TMI.)  I actually prefer Nirvana to this joint and I very much dislike Nirvana.  \nWow so I sound like a total snob in this review, but really, it's just awful!

The store front is a rowhouse with a neon \"Open\" sign in the window and an old unlit sign beneath it.  The front door is open and all you see is a long hallway with dim yellow lighting.  Sketchy characters on the sidewalk make you involuntarily prepare your fight/flight responses.  Be ready for anything...\n\nBut, first walk across Olden Avenue to the liquor store to pick up authentic Polish beer to make the experience complete.  In the back of the store is the Polish section.  More sketchy guys standing around - these 'packin' employees watch your every move.  But, the Xywiec Beer is back there in bottles or cans. I pulled out a six pack of glass and brought it to the counter. $10. minimum for credit cards, so I had to pull out my wallet (I really didn't want to do it).  Done. Walked back across the street and up the front steps of 925.  On the first door to the left was the restaurant sign bidding we enter.  What was behind the door? \n\nI went in first.  I was greeted by an apartment converted into a small eatery.  Yellow walls, stained wood trim. Wall sconces, but little other adornment.  No one else in the main dining area.  We stood a moment and waited to see if someone would come out to seat us.  A few long seconds later a woman appeared from the rear with a warm smile and firm voice welcoming us to her shop.  She was the owner, hostess, and chef.  Very big persona.  Lovely, and I immediately relaxed.  At 6:30 we expected other patrons, but we were the first and only folks there all night.  She sat us at a central table for 4, allowing us to spread out.  NFL Playoffs had depleted her clientele, but we were quite happy to have all her attention.  \n\nAfter getting the lay of the land from the gracious Madame, we ordered off the rather small menu, which is in both English and Polish.  The Polish Plate to share as our appetizer.  It consisted of Meat Pierogies, Potato Pancakes, Kielbasa in Yellow Mustard, and Apple Sauce.  The Pierogies were the least enjoyable part of the dish. While the dough was lightly fried and was a good consistency, the meat was too dense and organ-tasting for me. The Potato Pancakes were large and thin, not very oily, and a good mix of potato and flour (to hold them together).  They were crispy on the edges and tasty with a dollop of Apple Sauce to mix a little sweetness with the mild saltiness of the latke. The Kielbasa was excellent.  Scored before grilling to help the heat penetrate and to avoid splitting, the outer skin was just firm enough to hold the link together, but when bitten, it gave way nicely to allow the very tender innards to meet the tongue, disclosing its softness and interesting spice.  It was the surprise star of the plate.  The mustard kicked up the flavor, but did not overwhelm the essence of the sausage.  \n\nWe had the Stuffed Cabbage and Breaded Chicken Cutlet as our entries.  The Cabbage dish came with Mashed Potato and Cucumber Salad.  The Cabbage was tender and the mix of beef and something else was good, but perhaps a little bland.  It needed something to sweeten it, or at least that was how my Polish-Jewish grandmother prepared them. The potatoes were not hot enough, and seemed to have been plated before visiting the oven. Mild disappointment.  The Cucumber Salad was a cream base and decent.  \n\nMy Chicken dish was excellent.  The breast was large, with a pleasantly hand dipped breading coating it.  I opted for Mushrooms rather than Tomato Sauce, and was very pleased with the freshness and amount piled on the chicken.  Very tasty and definitely something I would order again.  The mashed were again cool and I left most of them alone.  The Red Beet Salad finished the plate.  Served appropriately cold, it was a nice fit, bringing mild sweetness to the mix of flavors in the breading, chicken, and shrooms.  I was happy.\n\nTo complete the repast, we ordered the Blintzes stuffed with Farmer's Cheese, and dusted with Powdered Sugar.  These babies were wonderful.  Perfect crepe wrap, and a whipped sweet cheesy filling.  Light, and a perfect end to the meal with freshly brewed coffee.  \n\nThis is a one of a kind richly local ethnic urban place that is easy to love.  The entire experience from the sidewalk scene, to the liquor store, to the special charm of the owner/chef, make Rozmaryn worth a visit or two.  When a meal becomes the food for a short story you have found something remarkable. \n\nThis was definitely that, and more.", "date": "2014-01-12 17:42:42"}, {"_key": "10021687", "_id": "reviews/10021687", "_rev": "_fNzD0tG--L", "review_id": "bOZrQp11XJ_t7sxCfnj6Mw", "user_id": "h4WWqOZ82sjZb47p0Rlqsg", "business_id": "K8O71Tb6xcza0g1MU608ag", "stars": 4, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Went there last night.

I wish the cucumber was chopped up- I found unpeeled large slices to be an odd choice for something meant to be mixed up and eaten with chopsticks (as opposed to a classic knife and fork salad).

This is a dish I would love to have again.\n\nThe Sauteed Black Fungus and Squash ($10.95) came with plenty of wood ear and Chinese squash stir-fried to perfection. The core of the squash was still firm, and crunchy wood ear added further textures. The dish was flavorful and the overall taste had form.\n\nService was the only downside on this visit. The server had a hands-off approach and no one seemed particularly friendly and warm. Otherwise, the complimentary tea and sauteed peanuts were very nice gestures. It was an outstanding meal.

But they don't offer any food happy hour specials, so there are a lot better choices in the city in that regard.\n\nWhen we got there it was empty, but it was also very early. The bartender was very helpful and nice and even turned down the air when we complained that we were cold.\n\nWe then moved to a table and were met with our server.  I didn't catch his name, and I don't think he gave it.\n\nWe then proceeded to order several different small plates and also a pizza.\n\nI always get the Warm Gorgonzola at Mondo because I'm a cheese freak, and it's delicious.  We were sure to ask the waiter for extra toast with it since we were sharing.  On my last visit, I noted that the portion size was much smaller than other times I had visited, and I felt the $8.50 was pricey for the amount given.  But I thought maybe it was a fluke because I had had it several times before and it was never that small.  But like I said, I love it, so I ordered it again.  \n\nWhat appeared at our table was nothing short of RIDICULOUS!  It was about 1/3 of the amount that it had been on my previous visit!  I am not exaggerating in the slightest when I tell you there was about 3-4 tablespoons of cheese in the small skillet it comes in and 1/3 of the cheese was so thinned out that you couldn't even get it off of the bottom of the skillet!  This came with TWO pieces of the toast.  Since there was obviously no sharing this item, we asked the waiter again for the extra toast.  And waited and waited.  Then we asked a bus boy.  Still didn't happen.  Then we asked our waiter again, and he brought us two more pieces of toast.  \n\nI proceeded to complain to the waiter about the size of the portion.  His reply?  \"I think they weigh it.\"  No apology.  No bringing over a manager.  Next time he came to our table, I bring it up again by saying...\"I really want to voice again how unhappy I am with the portion size of this dish.\"  His response?  \"It's not my fault.  I'm just a the waiter.\"  What?\n\nThe portion sizes of the other items also seemed small for what they are charging.\n\nThe only thing that I was VERY happy about and had no complaints about was the fig and prosciutto pizza!  It was AMAZING! We wished we had just ordered a couple of those instead of the other items.\n\nI hate to have to give Mondo only 2 stars because I used to love it so much.  In actuality, if Yelp allowed 1/2 stars, I'd give it 2 and a 1/2.

It took about 30 minutes for them to help five people before us. The attendant really didn't not know what he was doing unfortunately, and overcharged us about $100 on our bill! We had to dispute this and he said when we return the car to try and get our money back. Seriously?? Anyway, the car selections were okay for a Standard SUV, they only had 2 choices for us! And we came an hour early and waited until our time of pickup to select our car. Our car was the only positive aspect of this rental, it was very new, clean, and efficient for our trip. When we returned the car, the rental agent (he was different than the attendant when we picked the car up), was very apologetic about our overages and dismissed them from our bill. Also, we tried calling the counter on the phone to see if we could return our car early and something is very wrong with their phone connection. It's very distant and hard to hear, the person at the counter hung up three times because we could not hear him. Anyways, it's a car rental company, and all of this is to be expected.

Head over if you want great atmosphere inside and out, some solid dishes, as well as activities while you wait for a table.. then look no farther. They have good food that lives up to the enticing menu choices. Great to enjoy sitting outside on a patio that overlooks well maintained grounds and a view of the water. The crab cakes my aunt got were east coast worthy, lots of chunky thick but light delicious crab seasoned just right and not loaded with breaded fillers, definitely worth doing that one again on a return visit - definitely say that is one to order. The corn on the Cobb street corn was super yummy, listed as a side didn't matter because it made the perfect appetizer for me. I didn't find it as delicious as the one I enjoy back home in Ferndale MI at a great spot Imperial, but it hit the spot. I would get it again. My Pompano fish was done top notch and sauce was very good with the shallot and sun dried tomato cream. I can bet that the sauce wasn't on the fish to avoid making the crust coating of the fish mushy but it then was mostly under and over the vegetables so getting the sauce into the bites of fish was a little more work than I expected. Mashed potatoes were good but nothing to jump up and down about. Hubby got the pork shank and it was great, love the chutney with it as excellent compliment of flavor but not as tender as hoped. Uncle got crab Mac and cheese for his dish since he wasn't super hungry after a snack downtown on the way here. Unfortunately he didn't care for the dish being on the dry side, he was expecting a more sauce and cheese component since it does say four cheese sauce to it. There didn't appear to be a cheese like sauce to it and like a dried pasta that had been tossed in a sauce the day before and dried up. The waitress would be there the entire time or disappear. She was good and friendly but when we told her that his dish was dry she said she would get some extra sauce right away, as well as a refill on soda. The thing is that I was facing the waitstaff direction where they had their side station outside and she was there chit chatting at times with other workers or re-stocking some silverware rolled in linen. That being the fact that I didn't see that she was overly busy with four more tables or a party of ten it was a crazy long wait for more sauce. Matter of fact she breezed by with drinks to another table after we had already waited a good while and I said as she looked over to say \"how is everything\" I said \"Good but that sauce for him?\" and she was like oh yes yes.. she buzzed by and my husband eventually got the soda refill from a different server. Hate to mention my husband who has a hawk eye did discover a pin head size teeny nip of tin foil in his mashed potatoes. Wanted to also tell our waitress but after she was hard to get on the sauce it made it something not worthwhile to complain some more. She didn't say much about making it right about the sauce or the incredibly long wait except explaining the sauce is made to order - so it took time. I have to confess I know how that goes personally & intimately being in the back of the house for many years, that sauce still shouldn't be as long a wait as it was. We indulged in the flourless chocolate cake but it was super dry, I am used to it having a more fudge like consistency or a texture that is delicate. This one was a dense chunk of dry block and the vanilla ice cream is a must to help that out. I would go back to try again but I was hoping for so much more than what we got. I would hope the sauce incident was a fluke and that some of the other dishes might deliver good results, as well as a waitress that might genuinely care a little bit more to go the extra mile to take something off the bill when we could all easily say we ate half our dish by the time his sauce was sent. In addition to waiting on drink refills, it shouldn't have to be a wait like that. Loved playing corn hole while we waited, bummed the one waitress I saw didn't find me to ask about a drink but maybe that isn't the way it works?.. loved that outside lounge deal. OH and when some light clouds were seen as we sat outside in 80+ Florida sunshine the table umbrella at the side of us was a nice shade to partake of the outdoor eating but the one server guy says \"if the rain comes we have to take your umbrella\" as he points to their side station of extra serving and tablewares they have to protect he says.. good thing the friendly guy at the table next to us heard me say.. \"so we just have to get wet?\" and offered we can join them if rain came to get protection under the umbrella. Now I could laugh that the server guy was joking but it was said more like we needed to understand and hey look at all our side work here to protect.. it wasn't in some joking fashion. Again nothing so dreaded that I can't look past but really some disappointments. I won't hurry back but I could try it again.", "date": "2019-04-20 13:35:17"}]
