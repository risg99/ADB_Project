The restaurant is located just outside the French Market on Frenchman St, in a lower-key, musically-influenced area of town.  I was looking forward to trying out their fried oyster po' boy, but unfortunately, the restaurant was out of oysters.  They use only Louisiana oysters and because of the oil spill in the Gulf, they cannot serve any dishes with oysters.  Boo.\n\nI subbed in a fish (catfish, I assume) po' boy instead and it was delectable.  It had catfish, shredded lettuce, slices of tomato, mayo, and pickles, inside a loaf of French bread.  With a side of fries, it was yummy and filling.\n\nSmall note on the fries: the menus have printed the fries are only $1.50 extra when ordered with a po' boy.  However, the restaurant charged us $2.00 and the server told us there was a sign out front that noted the change.  The menus still say $1.50 though.  The restaurant needs to correct this.  How are you just going to leave incorrect pricing in your menu (50 cents isn't a lot, but it's the principle)?\n\nWe were told by our waitress to try their fried chicken next time.  The waiters and waitresses are dressed in white dress shirts and black slacks with black top hats and suspenders.  The floor is tiled in black and white tiles.  The restaurant is connected to a small praline/candy shop where you can buy fresh daily-made pralines.  The pralines are about $2 apiece.

My particular order consisted of a medium rare patty served with aged cheddar, Benton's bacon (very good), and ketchup served on an artisan bun.  Basically, it was a gussied up bacon cheeseburger, but it was a rather tasty one.  My major complaint is that I wish the actual meat itself exhibited more flavor.  Having said that, the burger was cooked properly and the flavors worked well together.  I ordered some wilted spinach on the side (mediocre) and truffle fries.  Let's talk about those truffle fries for a bit.  I know more people are apparently into the sweet potato fries here, but I think they are missing the boat.  Burger Up's truffle tries have pleasant aroma, taste great, and are the perfect texture for soaking up oil.  If you are on a diet, it is true you should skip these delightful fries.  But if that were the case, why are you at a burger joint in the first place?  Seriously, if you get nothing else out of my review, please do yourself a favor and order the truffle fries.  \n\nBurger Up also boast an interesting beer menu with semi-obscure breweries from the Deep South included in the list.

Where there were once specific streets or neighborhoods that were known to be great for vintage shopping in any given city, that's no longer the case in cities like New Orleans or New York. I look at the 50+ dresses that are in my closet, mainly from the 20s through the early 60s. It's discouraging to note that even though I don't really even wear them anymore, they are slowly but surely disintegrating (especially my 1920s and 30s numbers). What was once a fine silk frock is now reduced to spiderweb thread-bare on the seams, shoulders and anywhere there's the slightest bit of friction. Evil moths have attacked cashmere sweaters (they sure do have good taste, as they leave alone the cheap cotton numbers) leaving them beyond repair.\n\nBut I don't mean to depress you. There's Blue Dream, restoring my faith in vintage. I looked through well-kept racks of dresses, men's shirts, jeans and accessories and was quite impressed.

New Orleans now has a fabulous Tiki bar, with just the right dark Polynesian atmosphere that's straight outta Trader Vics circa 1965. My mom would always regale me with stories about her times at Hawaii Kai in Manhattan in the 60s. As a child, I'd cherish our annual trips to Mai Kai in Fort Lauderdale (which still exists, apparently!) Fun fact: About 5 years ago, I was a featured bartender in Inked Magazine where I talk about making Tiki drinks (you can see the photo in my profile), as I worked in a Tiki bar in NYC (Waikiki Wally's RIP).\n\nSo, yeah. I'm a lover all things Tiki, though I have to admit, I hate loathe and despise sweet drinks for obvious reasons, but hell, it's a Yelp review so I'll just come out and say it: usually sweet drinks mask cheap liquor. Usually sweet drinks are meant for people who aren't drinkers and can't stand the taste of alcohol. And last but certainly not least, sweet drinks mean for inevitable hangover. I pride myself on being a veteran drinker and at most, get one hangover a year. In fact, my year anniversary of my last hangover is coming up. July 4. \n\nThe fabulous thing is, Tiki Tolteca offers up *craft* Tiki drinks. Yes, you're reading that correctly. Look at my menu photos that detail the ingredients! They even offer up little stories with each drink. Their cocktails don't only feature rum, but such lovely spirits as my beloved Mezcal, and my much less beloved ca\u00e7aca. I settled on a Hemingway Daiquiri, which is frozen and perfect because it's not a fruit daiquiri, so not filled with artificial nonsense, just lime, rum, & maraschino liqueur. And potent, seeing as I was feeling a nice buzz after two.\n\nThey also have a menu feature small plates with a tropical flavor. DO NOT PASS UP THAT CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE DESSERT. The Tiki gods command it, too. Seriously. It really is the stuff of the gods. Chocolate, coconut, banana sauce... 'scuse me while I talk in tongues. I look forward to going back and trying the sweet corn tamales (vegetarian!). No crab rangoons, though, thankfully (created at Don the Beachcomber and now for some reason is expected on any given Chinese restaurant menu for some perplexing reason).\n\nOh!! Be sure and order a High Life, if you're so inclined, so you can get the full bottle service experience. This is no joke. They serve it in Champagne glasses and ice your bottle. Luckily my drinking partners indulged so I didn't have to.\n\nMore fun trivia. You may see in my profile that my current (and forever) crush is Howard Hughes.

I've spend many an idyllic afternoon/evening here. I've also booked several of my colleagues at the Mazarin when they've come to New Orleans and heard good things from them (as recently as January 2015).\n\nSo when looking to book a hotel for a work conference 10 people I was leading, Hotel Mazarin was at the top of my list. And when you realize that in other local hotels you're probably going to get that New Orleans jenk known as \"charm\"  for a similar price, I will absolutely recommend Hotel Mazarin for being immaculate (with one tiny exception in my bathroom, but I'm insane), amenities (almost Westin-quality beds, flatscreen TVs), and the restrained modern baroque decor (gold fixtures, marble floors). If you're a breakfast-lover, you cannot beat that deluxe complimentary breakfast (eggs & bacon, pastry, toast, cereal, juices). Seriously, I've stayed in New Orleans hotels with TVs straight out of the 90s, ancient (as in, not antique) beds, dated decor and questionable levels of cleanliness. I won't name names (search my reviews if you must). But Hotel Mazarin boasts higher standards. \n\nThat said, my colleagues and I had some issues during our stay last month that should be noted. \n\n-multiple reports of the front desk/reception staff being aloof and often downright surly (unacceptable and so not typical of the superb hospitality that is the custom of New Orleans. I'm honestly scratching my head over this one). One of my people was reprimanded for putting a room card/key in her wallet when she came down to report that her keys weren't working (she never put it in her wallet but even if she had?!) When she explained that she had done no such thing, the response from the desk was an eye roll. Another colleague called the desk to report that his room was noisy. With a week of late nights and early mornings ahead of him, he thought he could request a quieter room. He was informed that he was in a quiet room. That's it. No apologies or explanations. I can write more, but in the interest of space, I leave it at these two instances. \n\nHowever, all of the other hotel staff were great, from management to catering (special props to the lovely Mary who took care of our conference room. She is a gem!) Everyone in the breakfast room and in catering were ALL so lovely and friendly (everyone says good morning and the catering manager walked around talking to everyone, making sure they were having a great stay). \n\n-the showers are extremely tricky to work and some of us didn't have anything hotter than lukewarm water. This is horrible to deal with first thing in the morning on one of the coldest weeks in New Orleans. I live here and I know the city's water pressure leaves a lot to be desired, especially in old French Quarter buildings, but this isn't OK in a hotel. Apparently there was some trick to get it to work and I can't even tell you what that is, because it's really *that* tricky. There should be instructions posted, unless this was a fluke with half of my colleagues' rooms. \n\n-catering: although the food is good, it's extremely overpriced for what you get. You are not allowed to bring in outside food, so if you're using their conference room you're going to have to use these services. I know this is common practice in hotel conference rooms, so although I won't fault them for this, next year I'll try and find an alternative.\n\nRelated to this: when setting up my catering order, I specified that three of my group had dietary restrictions/extreme food allergies. For the very expensive muffaletta sandwiches, I thought they'd at least offer a GF bread option for one or two of them for my G/F colleague, but no. Second, I was told the king cake would be nut free and it was not. Suddenly I saw one of my colleagues leaving the room in the middle of a session and I later learned that he had to go up to his room and take an emergency Benadryl. If he hadn't, he likely would have needed to go to the hospital, for his nut allergy is that extreme. If I put on my request that at least one dessert should be nut free and the only other dessert item is pralines, the cooks should pay attention and not put nuts on the king cake. Pretty simple. Attention to detail is crucial. Again, when you're paying extremely high prices for catering, high expectations should be met.\n\nI would still recommend Hotel Mazarin thanks to its amazing location for visitors to our city, as well as the nice perks, including two comped drinks at the fabulous 21st Amendment Bar.

We were here for UC Dining Days and the dishes were great.  I had the chicken satay app with the red curry chicken, and found both to be very good.  The satay was juicy and flavorful with a great peanut dipping sauce, and the curry was very solid although it wasn't very spicy.  I also had a few bites of the triple flavor tilapia in the sweet and sour sauce, and really like the crispy, pan-seared fillet combined with the garlicky sauce.  Will definitely have to get this next time.  Most restaurants like to fry the fillet when they make a sweet and sour dish but pan searing actually brings out the flavor more and gives that delicious crispy exterior without killing your arteries.  We finished off with the mango sticky rice and coconut rice pudding.  While the mango sticky rice was very good, I liked the coconut rice pudding more because I love all things coconut and this was a delicious coconut-based concoction.  If you are in the area this week, and need to grab a bite, definitely stop in for the $15 dining days special.  It's a great deal and the food is very good.  They also have homemade beef jerky at $6/order, which I couldn't resist getting to-go; while it wasn't as fantastic as my aunt's homemade jerky, the meat was very well-marinated and flavorful and great paired with the accompanying chili paste.

The bisque was delicious: creamy and savory with a hint of fennel and perhaps truffle (I think?).  Anyhow, whatever the exact flavors were, they meshed well and made for a very good soup.

It was a nice change from the typical cinnamon butter and just so creamy with a perfect balance of pecan and the butter's inherent flavor.  It almost made me want to get another croissant just so I could finish it.  But then I would have been brought more butter and gluttony would have taken over.

So you can walk one direction towards the Museum  and go through Ben Franklin Parkway and through the Rodin Museum and near towards Eastern State Penitentiary or towards Reading Terminal which will lead you close to the Liberty Bell and other touristy sites.\n\nUpon arrival, we had the valet take our car. They offer a in and out service which was very convenient for us. It allowed us to take the car out at night and see some the sites and hit up Pat's Steaks. The checking in process here is a breeze. The concierge was really friendly and helpful. There were a few things I disliked about the hotel. One would have to be their elevators. They have 3 elevators but they were all so slow! My second was their bathroom. The toilet seat was loose and the sink counter and cabinet below was dirty. I had to wipe everything down with disinfectant wipes. Everything else was pretty spot on. The beds were a bit small but it was bearable. The rooftop pool was nothing luxurious but for what it is, it worked. It wasn't crowded, they had fresh towels on hand and plenty of seating. Beverages weren't allowed at the pool site. The views were pretty nice.\n\nVerdict - I would definitely come back to Windsor Suites if I were to visit Philly again in the future. I would just suggest to the management and housekeeping to make sure the toilet seats are on tight so that they don't wobble or break loose every time you sit down. And I hope in the future, the dust and dirt that was all over the sink cabinet would be gone. The value and price you pay is definitely worth it since you're getting a suite. Kitchen is kinda small, water and coffee are complimentary but I wouldn't recommend using their coffee machine. It is filthy! We ran water through it, and the hot water it produced was utterly disgusting! The closets were plentiful spacious. Our view was okay, 10th floor view of other high rise buildings.

Of course for brunch the coffee/hot food was the busiest and had a long line (though nothing compared to Biscuit Love). It took us around 10 minutes to get through the line and order our food, which I consider pretty amazing for peak brunch time on Sunday without a reservation. I ordered the avocado toast with one fried egg and my BF had the fried chicken biscuit with gravy. We each had coffee and lucky for me they had just started serving frose (rose with watermelon puree and vermouth). It was delicious, refreshing, and not sweet at all which is how I like my rose. The coffee was strong and delicious and came out pretty quickly after ordering it. The drinks were really on point. Our entrees came out on paper plates and we had to use plastic silverware. This was really confusing. The ambiance is sleek and upscale, so this was quite a bit of a turn off and left something to be desired. It's also difficult to eat a messy fried chicken biscuit with gravy using a flimsy knife and fork. Also my avocado toast looked slopped on the plate. I thought that was again weird for a nice establishment. Especially when the total cost with tip was $32.00 (I did get alcohol but still). \nHowever, what the food lacked in visual appeal more than made up for in taste. Both dishes were very good. I would leave the egg off the toast next time, but it was still fresh and tasty.

Google showed me that it wasn't the contestant I'd been thinking of, but I was still curious enough to want to try the place. The wait was close to 45 minutes as estimated, and we eventually got a small table by the window. For lack of supply our table wasn't equipped with the same set of hot sauces as the neighboring tables. Margarita flavors of the day were strawberry or mango, and a pitcher of the latter pleasantly sloshed us by the end of dinner.\n\nI was sad to see that their menu online hadn't been updated with the recent changes. While I understand that it's a pain to keep stock for a vegetarian ingredient that isn't present in any other dishes, I'd been really looking forward to the cactus and sweet potato burrito. Which reminds me, I haven't seen a neighborhood so vegetarian-friendly in a long time. John was gung-ho about what appetizers we were going to get, so I let him take charge of those while I picked out our entrees. Given the amount of food we were about to indulge in, we opted to pass on the endless chips and salsa. As strongly as his roommate recommended the barbecue, I was pretty realistic about our consumption of food and chalked the pork belly off for a later visit.\n\nI've never seen fried pickle chips cut so thick (a hefty quarter-inch), and the texture was right on the border between cuke and pickle. The spicy chili mayo it came with was an okay pairing, nothing special. Of everything on our table it was the least spectacular, and as a result it was the only thing we left unfinished.\n\nThe single order of veggie wings with ranch sauce arrived at the same time as the other app. Celery and carrot sticks were acceptably fresh, though the celery was the lower quality of the two. The seitan was sliced thin and fried to crisps before tossed in buffalo wing sauce. An interesting plate that I was content to eat, but definitely takes an open-minded palate to appreciate. Not sure that I'd get this again, but I'd be tempted to make this at home if I went herbivore.\n\nSince the shrimp and chorizo burritos each came as a pair, we traded our spares to share the entree experience. The radish slices were nice to have, but I was unimpressed by the jicama cabbage slaw. I think my main criticism is that the tortillas tasted straight out of the package. I would've enjoyed each bite more had an attempt been made to lightly grill the wrappers. The chorizo was my favorite of the two; instead of pineapple, it's now served with roasted red potatoes that give it a fantastic rustic flavor. The wedge lime lightened the heaviness of the burrito, and I could totally picture this as an amazing breakfast burrito if scrambled egg were included. The shrimp burrito tasted of very fresh ingredients, but citrus wasn't present enough to make the seafood really pop. Sadly, this made the room-temperature tortilla overwhelm the light flavor of the shrimp.\n\nService was friendly enough to come by to top off our glasses for us despite the packed crowd and the pitcher being right there for our own dispensation. Two bathrooms behind the ATM/cigarette machines, surprisingly clean and tagged with random graffiti that actually fits right in with the feel of the place.

New Orleans is packed with tourists, drunks, and misfits.  Every damn bar, every restaurant, good or bad, was packed.  No reservations.  All first come, first serve.  There was a line around 3 Muses like it was the hottest club in Manhattan.  We walked up to the hostess, where she proceeded to tell us that they weren't even taking anymore names.  We were both sorely disappointed.  All week we were looking forward to coming here.  It was the best food we had on our first trip to the city.\n\nAnyway...  \nWe walked away like 2 kids that just lost their pup.  We wandered around the open market across the street when The Man says, \"Hey.. Let's go back and see if we can get lucky.\"  I looked at him like, \"Are you out of your goddamned mind?!\"  Ugh...  but, I agreed.  I waited across the street while I watched him have a few words with the hostess.  He signals me to come over, and \"BAM!!\".  The hostess tell us to wait at the bar and have a drink and she'll call us when there was a table available.\n\nI fuckin love this man...\nWe walked over to the bar to order a couple of cocktails, and what happens???  2 bar stools open up right in front of us and we're in...  UNBELIEVABLE.\n\nThe food...\nStill the best damn food in NOLA.  The menu I noticed has changed so I won't go into details of what we ate because it'll probably change again but expect to be blown away by an explosion of flavors.  (make sure to get the lamb burgers) The chef certainly has a sweeter palate so, for some of you, you might not be so keen on a few of their plates, but I thought it was fucking fantastic.

This confusion extends to the kitchen, wherein the recent chef switcheroo of Michael Stevenson for Leo Forneas has led to the restaurant's refocus from the pure Southern bourbon and blues motif that previously and not very successfully defined them since opening a few years ago.\n\nOn a normal day, this would be enough in itself, but I chose to visit during Mother's Day, pretty much the worst day for dining out, especially when you're part of a party of eight. So the service, while not bad, per se, gets a pass. What doesn't get a pass is the prix fixe menu from which we were forced to order. The menu consisted of literally every item of their normal brunch menu, plus a couple of desserts, for a significantly higher price than normal. So say you wanted to order the salad and buttermilk chicken sandwich - $15 on a normal Sunday. $35 on Mother's Day. But you got a choice of beignets or panna cotta for dessert, so I'm sure that warranted the extra markup. Needless to say, I made it a priority to choose the absolute most expensive things on their normal brunch menu.\n\nAnother problem with just throwing your entire menu onto a prix fixe is portion sizes. My tuna tartare was simply mixed with the occasional sliced cornichon and served alongside a few potato chips, but it was fresh and a good size to prime to palate for the rest of the meal. Some of my fellow diners got the pigs in a blanket, which were nearly a main course in themselves. After plowing through a few of them, multiple people remarked at how full they were getting, and the main course hadn't even arrived yet. \n\nThe Maryland Crab cake eggs benedict isn't what you'd expect to find in a Southern-slanted restaurant, but I'm glad it's here, because the crab cakes were almost all crab, and went really well with the eggs (poached well for me, though others weren't so lucky), mustard hollandaise, and English muffin. Serving them alongside french fries seemed like they just didn't want to take the time to prepare an additional starch, and I didn't want to take the time to eat the underwhelming slices of potato. \n\nFried dough is an easy crowd pleaser, and the beignets hit the spot, even if they were still a little doughy. The gluten-free diner amongst us described her panna cotta as \"interesting,\" and not in a good way, though she seemed unfamiliar with the dish. \n\nTo be honest, the combination of food and company provided an overall positive experience at Twisted Tail, though there were enough missteps to not make it a priority to return.

Perfect brunch meal right?  Eh.  Was just okay.  The burger wasn't anything spectacular, definitely not anything to rave about.  It was juicy, but lacked flavor.  Usually the bun makes the burger (for me at least), and I thought the sesame roll was okay.  Tasted like an everyday burger bun to me.

I've always always wanted to try duck fat fries.  These left me wanting more.  Really...is this what they really taste like?  I hope not.  These fries were more soggy than crispy, and left a weird after taste in my mouth.  The cheddar sauce was a welcomed additional, but not necessary.  The sauce would have been better if it was hotter.  \n\nWhen our waitress finally came back with our food, we were able to order the Irish Car Bomb shake ($9).

However, you have to be able to read Chinese and order from their \"secret\" menu.  Are they assholes for not translate the menu and keep their delicious authentic goods from the general population?  Not really.  I think \"lost in translation\" is the reason why a restaurant like Wok on the Wild Side has so many negative reviews and why many restaurant don't even bother with translation.   \n\nI have never seen a restaurant generated so many opposite opinions.  I was intrigued by my fellow reviewers and I had to see it for myself.  Is this place really bad or simply misunderstood.  \n\nThe restaurant was clean and simply decorated.  The owner was from Dong Bei (North East China) and a first time restauranteur.  It seems like the combos were not well priced compare to the entrees and personally I would not recommend stir fry dishes that had being sitting out for more than 15 minutes.  I got the entree size xiang la pai gu and it came with a bowl of steamed rice.  I counted 11 meaty ribs pieces  with jalapeno, onions, and dry red chilies.  The sauce was very spicy and flavorful, but I agree with others that it was salty even considering that Sichuan cuisine tends to be heavily seasoned.  Most restaurants use cheaper long grain rice, but here they used starchier short grain rice that Chinese, Korean, and Japanese prefer because sticky short grain rice pick up sauce better than hard fluffy long grain rice.   \n\nI spotted a pan of kou shui ji next to a line of ubiquitous looking stir fries.  I can't help it but get a small box to go.  Kou shui ji literally translates to salivating chicken, so good, you'll salivate thinking about it.  Its boiled whole chicken cut into more manageable chunks, with bones and skins, soaked in a sauce made of spices and red chili oil.  This was not on the menu and it was very good and authentic.

There's also a lot that isn't quite up to par.\n\nPros:\n- Happy Hour: 50-cent oysters? Pretty sure I died and went to heaven. And they were huge, succulent, deliciously briny Gulf Coast oysters! Some were easily twice the size of normal oysters\n- Delicious cocktails: Seeing as they were half off because of HH, I indulged and got both the Champagne au Peche (Champagne and fresh peach puree) and the St. Charles Streetcar (St. Germain, pear vodka, Champagne). Both were tasty and refreshing\n\nCons:\n- The Reveillon menu left a lot to be desired. For the first course, my boyfriend got the shrimp remoulade and I got the crispy sweetbread with beluga lentils and blood orange brown butter vinaigrette. The remoulade was flavorless and forgettable. The sweetbread was actually well-cooked (very crisp) but got to be too rich after a while.\n- The turtle soup and seafood gumbo that made up our second course were both terrible. There was maybe a kernel of turtle meat in the entire bowl of soup and the gumbo lacked seasoning. Our third course consisted of crispy flounder stuffed with crab, shrimp and mirliton dressing, and a rib roast with oyster dressing, turnip and apple puree, and cherry compote. - \n- The roast was decent if a bit chewy, but the flounder was so rich that my boyfriend couldn't finish it. \n- Our final course was dessert--bread pudding with vanilla ice-cream and hot buttered pecan sauce for him, apple tart with caramel and praline ice-cream for me. The praline ice-cream was great, but the bread pudding was too sweet in my opinion and the apple tart was virtually inedible on account of being too dry.\n- Service was also disappointing for a restaurant with this reputation.

Sushi is a totally new concept for Tampa. It's conveyor-belt sushi also known as kaiten-sushi or kaiten-zushi or sushi-go-round in Japan. You sit at a booth and grab the sushi you want and pay at the end.\n\nMy first experience with this kind of sushi was in San Francisco when I first tried sushi as a 5-year old at Isobune Sushi in Japantown and I have longed for a conveyor-belt style sushi place to come to Tampa since I moved here in 1999. Yo! Sushi is finally making that a reality.\n\nThe style of Yo! Sushi is modern and different from Isobune. The focus is on fast, fresh, and convenient and the setup of the place follows this focus. When you walk-up to the restaurant it's open and easy to get a seat at. Call-buttons are placed at each table to make it easy to get service and close your check.\n\nSushi is constantly being rolled and made by the sushi chefs at the restaurant and the open-kitchen let's you watch the chefs in action. I have faith a high-traffic area like the International Plaza will help ensure the freshness of the fish at Yo! Sushi. \n\nPlates range from $3-$6 and contain a variety of cooked and raw sushi, cooked Japanese food, and dessert. There's a little bit of something for everyone depending on your tastes. \n\nOne of my favorite things I have tried so far is the Chicken Katsu Curry which comes a small plate with rice below and about 5 cuts of katsu for $5. I often want to order katsu at restaurants, but find it hard to justify spending $15 on dinner for one - especially when I also want sushi with my food and end up just ditching the katsu. This meets me halfway.\n\nAs far as the sushi is concerned - it tastes fresh and is certainly above what you would find at a buffet or something like Koizi/Saki Endless Sushi. It's not quite the highest quality of sushi which is understandable considering the price and focus, but still satisfactory to me for the taste. Most of the sushi leans towards salmon, tuna, and imitation crab/crab special or California Roll-creations. \n\nI also liked the Popcorn Shrimp (tastes more like Bang Bang Shrimp), Takoyaki (hard to find a decent one in Tampa for sure!), and the Kimchi Salmon Steamed Bun (bun was just right and salmon pretty good quality!). There are plenty of things to try though so repeat visits will need to be made!\n\nFor me, Yo! Sushi is great for a quick and tasty meal when I'm in a rush and don't necessarily want to spend as much time/money at a regular Japanese sushi restaurant. I can see how someone who wants a really high-end Japanese experience may not approve, but then one should also consider price and time into factors of that justification.\n\nThe service is friendly/approachable and the managers clearly really love working for Yo! Sushi which is something plenty of restaurants in Tampa Bay seem to lack and may come from them being an international company.\n\nDefinitely check it out even if it's just to try something new for fun with some friends or family.

They did however only give me half a waffle which was a little less than I would have liked (and waffle batter is dirt cheap so I think it would be nice if they give you a whole waffle even with the half chicken order). I thought the chicken was only average, the waffle was probably better than average. My husband had a fried chicken sandwich and said it was decent but a bit bland. \n\nI'd say 3.5 stars for food, but am rounding up because the service was really friendly and prompt. We were seriously in and out in about 30 minutes, which was appreciated because we had our infant daughter with us and she started fussing near the end of the meal (fortunately the restaurant is pretty loud and no one seemed to notice or care).

True, it's hard to screw that up, but I wasn't feeling adventurous enough to try one of their \"stuffed\" pastas.  I decided to play it safe.\n\nThis is one of those places that you know what you're getting when you go.  It's a chain.  The food is mass produced.

After you order they give you a number and you sit and wait. On this day the wait was about 15 minutes, because of the crowd, but that wasn't a problem. When my number was called I got my food and I was on my way.\n\nThe chicken itself is tasty and really generous. There was an even mix of wings and legs and I enjoyed it. The fries weren't anything spectacular and the salad was just lettuce, so next time I might skip the combo and get the 14 piece for $8 deal. While Golden Wings isn't on the level of Popeyes, you can't beat the price and the food is enjoyable.

You go up, and you can pick what kind of tortilla you want: spicy, wheat, white, or spinach, and wait a few minutes while your burrito is rolled.  The spinach tortilla intrigued me, but since it was my first time, I went with the basic white flour tortilla.  I got it stuffed with pork carnitas, rice, black beans, lettuce, tomato, jalape\u00f1os, cheese, guac and green sauce.  Does that sound like a lot?  Yeah, it was a ton!  They put it together for me, rolled it, handed it over and served it with a drink for about 10 bucks.\n\nThe burrito was really dense, well made and good.  I couldn't finish it all and I was happy to have plenty of leftovers.  My friend and I also split some chips and queso, which was fantastic and plenty enough for both of us (we didn't even finish it all).\n\nYou don't have to get a burrito here, of course.

There's an expansive bar, plenty of seating and also a patio for those wanting to people watch during lunch. \n\nWe came to Carmine's from Scottrade watching the Blues loose to the Flyers - great action at an exceptional venue. Carmine's was recommended to us by the cab driver and a fine recommendation it was.\n\nOur server was prompt and handed us a couple of menus - the alcohol menu was fairly extensive with four pages covering the various wines, house drinks and beers - I selected a quite good Deschutes Brewery Obsidian Stout and my dining companion went for a glass of red.\n\nThe food menu featured some interesting appetizers, Salads, Chicken, Steaks/Chops and Seafood. What intrigued me was the local favorite fried ravioli and we decided to split the appetizer (note that I had been warned that this local treat was \"disgusting\" - not my words). After trying it, I'm sorry but I simply can't recommend it here (and I'm betting that it's very well done at Carmine's). For me, the issue with the fried ravioli is that it contains beef - I think that if it were chicken or something a bit less fatty it would be fine. As it is, when you cut into the ravioli you're greeted by a greasy meatball surrounded by a lightly breaded ravioli pasta. The marinara did little to cut the grease and after eating one I couldn't stomach a second. Oh well, I was warned!\n\nFor dinner I selected the 10 oz Filet Mignon, inquiring about getting it black-and-blue (cold, rare guts with a bit of char on the outside). For a side I chose the broccoli sans the cheese sauce. The steak, while it could have had a bit more char it was indeed perfectly cooked temperature-wise. The broccoli wasn't anything special (maybe the cheese would have improved the dish? I almost asked for it on the side). I was passed a plate of mushroom risotto which was much better - I was just trying to save some of the calories and have something green.\n\nOverall, I thought the steak was just about perfect, the sides mediocre and the appetizer yucky. However, based on the excellent beer and the steak, I still think this restaurant is worth visiting and giving a try, especially if you happen to be downtown. Also, the service was excellent - I don't remember the server's name but she was quick, answered our questions and was very patient with a couple of visitors.\n\n(also published to my food blog)", "date": "2015-12-25 13:43:37"}, {"_key": "51671", "_id": "reviews/51671", "_rev": "_fNyp8T2--g", "review_id": "i6HU1xSCCXAR7cRVwlpi2Q", "user_id": "nwuO-ifpsecjxeFPYAFBwg", "business_id": "0wQCEcpZ57TmTm6EmEDsIw", "stars": 4, "useful": 2, "funny": 1, "cool": 2, "text": "Our group visiting from Atlanta hit Hendricks Tuesday evening while in St Louis.

We started with the BBQ Nachos and went straight to dinner. Along with three \"The Whole Shebang\" platters (basically one of everything from their smoky BBQ menu) we ordered additional sides to try them all - there were 6 at our table and plenty to take home with everyone full to-the-gills.\n\nBeing from the South I think I know BBQ and at Hendricks I wasn't disappointed - what better place to get St Louis style BBQ than in St Louis? While I thought everything good and smoky flavored, I am accustomed to more rind (seems to be more of a Southern thing, I'm also accustomed to a bit of creosote - that last not a particularly good thing but a result of over-long smoking).

Well Charles LaScala shouldn't worry because this is a very good mid-level Italian restaurant.\n\nI've been to dinner, lunch, and happy hour here all multiple times so I know my way around this place. Before I discuss the many great things about this establishment I'll mention two issues that are less than good.\n\nFirst this place has an active bar with multiple TVs.  This is great for Happy Hour but not so great if you are seated near it with the intention of having a peaceful meal.  So Rule #1 is to ask to be seated away from the bar.  I've never found this to be a problem as the staff is very accommodating.\n\nSecond, in my opinion, the adult libations are generally a dollar or two too high for a mid-level Italian place.  It's very easy to order drinks here that go over $10.  So consider yourself forewarned.\n\nSo let's talk about all the positive attributes-\n\nThe location is fabulous.  It's within walking distance of Olde City, the Walnut Street Theater, the Historic District, etc., etc.  \n\nThe have a few outside tables and Chestnut Street is great for people watching.\n\nThese folks have one of the best free parking arrangements in all of Philadelphia.  That's right, I said free and the parking lot is in the same building.  If you are driving in it doesn't get any better than this. Note that free parking is available after 3 PM.  \n\nThey use OpenTable so making your reservation is super convenient.  By the way, these folks do a great job during Restaurant Weeks. Make yourself a note to book early for those coveted RW seatings.\n\nRegarding the food; expect classic Italian in large portions.  It doesn't matter if you are a carnivore, like your protein from the sea, or are of the vegetarian persuasion.  Everybody will be happy here.  Expect appetizers to be about $10 and entr\u00e9es to range from the high teens to mid-twenties. \n\nThe Broccoli Rabe appetizer ($10) is to die for.  It comes with sweet Italian sausage and grilled polenta.  The lovely wife has tried the Chicken Alla Roma ($21) and pronounced it excellent.  It comes with mushrooms and asparagus in a lemon-caper sauce.\n\nIf you are in this part of town, give them a try for lunch.

Many might argue that the past fifty or so years have not been kind to the city of St. Louis, but just in the past decade (coincidentally the same amount of time Vince Valenza's BCD has been open) there's been a notable change in this city, and Blues City Deli has come to represent this transformation using everyone's favorite medium: sensational sandwiches. \n\nStar 1: How were the service and atmosphere?\n\nWhile I hear there are often (and rightfully so) lines out the door at Blues City Deli, I strolled in with a buddy on a Saturday afternoon and was blown away right from the get go.

The atmosphere was vibrant, the crowd was into it, the band was into it, and the whole experience lit up the whole block.

Star Granted. \n\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\n\nI'd be lying if I told you I remembered the exact price of my pretzelwich, but honestly who cares. The sandwiches at BCD are all priced comparably, and they're priced fairly given what are generous portions. My sandwich was a beast, and I left satisfied without a hole in my wallet. Star Granted. \n\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\n\nI could probably just list the ingredients of my sandwich (shaved pork, bacon, cheese, optional pickles, and a not at all optional sauce on a pretzel roll) and have you in a fit of hunger, but I'll add some commentary in saying that the sandwich was brilliant in just about every way. \n\nTo top that off, all of the other sandwiches around me looked equally tasty as did the cookies and other treats.

Simply too often I've rolled into modern ice cream or gelato spots only to find that I either have basic chocolate and vanilla to choose from or some kale and blueberry goat cheese nonsense. Mike's leaves the gentrification at the door, offering up a huge selection of classics, contemporary flavors, and combinations of the two that are sure to satisfy anyone. \n\nMy caramel cone in particular was very, very good, with the right ratio of caramel to cone and ice cream.

New Orleans has true fusion cuisine meaning it is not made up by restaurant owners to make money. New Orleans has a fusion of cultures so the cuisine is a reflection on the culture. http://www.bestofneworleans.com/gambit/benefit-for-new-york-at-three-muses/Content?oid=2099590\nIt has  romantic ambiance   as seen in  this Youtube video in terms of the ambiance .  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tMiSczO3q\nHowever the tables are a bit uncomfortable. \nI was looking  forward to Three Muses so much more than  anywhere else we had on our list in  Nola!  We went on  a Wednesday night. There was a line  45 minutes long. They do not take cell numbers or have a real system they just tell you to come back. \nWe kept going back. It was too cold to wait so long. We were in Nola  during a cold  spell and I got sick from the cold.\n When  we  finally got in  there were signs  all over saying you must buy one drink per person  per set! The seats  were  uncomfortable and the door was open  with the cold air coming in. If you look at pictures of their FB page it looks spacious but when we were there seats  were all cramped together.\nThe young lady taking names was rude, she was not even paying  attention to her list of names. She kept letting people in front of us in  spite of the fact that  we came back early several times. Several hours went by with the same pattern.\nWe finally made it in.  But things didn't get too much  better. \nIt is a bit chaotic in there.  I have to refer you to this review. This reviewer says it better than  I do. http://www.yelp.com/biz/three-muses-new-orleans#hrid:VsLBIA-cW-uA_PiPfgX0hg\nThe  restaurant was out of everything I wanted to eat.\nI had to leave it was too uncomfortable and we didn't get  to try  the  food  I know it is good other wise there would not be lines when other places are  empty but I did not have a good experience there! Plus they were out of everything I wanted and it was still early at  least for us New Yorkers it was early.\n We could not get a cab back to the hotel and had to walk in  the cold at  night! It was too stressful for me!\n I am  very disappointed in my experience there because I know it is good based on the  menu, the lines and ambiance.\n The lines were not filled with  tourists but locals.\n What I didn't know was there was  apparently  a big name there that night which is why  they  charged per set.  I did not know that. You can keep up with  them on  FB,  https://www.facebook.com/ThreeMuses\nHowever they had no special announcements on FB the night  we went so we were not prepared for the long  wait or cold open doors.  It  was a big waste of time for us and I wish they had a more efficient  way  of taking names and keeping up with how many people come so tables do not have to be squeezed together. I have to give it 3 stars for my experience since we wasted an entire night of our  very short vacation  which I got sick waiting  in  the cold. Nola had a cold spell when  we were there.\n Again I am very disappointed.  But how long we waited and the fact that  it was so cramped and the fact  that  they were out of everything  made it a disappointing experience for us. I need to add that  it was mid week not a weekend and not on  a tourist street.\nI am giving it 3 stars to be fair since I didn't get to try the  food.  I usually do not review places I have not eaten at like many Elites seem to do such  as trying to be first to review saying when it opens I hope to try it. That  is not me.\n That is those who are  Elite so they can keep their review count up. But since it ruined an entire night of our vacation I needed to review it  hoping they might change  their methods hoping it won't happen to others.\n The music had not started yet either. . If it is that crazy of a wait to get in  perhaps there should be a cover charge  and not charge  per set.  In that  case what happens is people wait around for the music and the tables are never cleared.  Especially when music has not started yet.

It was in the 90's that day. Oof. My mistake for not knowing that a majority of the seats were in the direct sun (I thought we were safe b/c we were in the terrace [sec 420, row 2] above home plate. HA, wrong-o!)*. Despite that, the city skyline views from that area above home plate are quite nice. \n\nThe stadium is a little bit of a walk from the train station and it is in the stadium \"corridor\" of Philly. Convenient, I suppose because ALL teams are in one area. If you drive to the Phillies game, there's a few huge parking lots, so, no worries. I would take public transit because it seems less of a hassle. \n\nIt's capacity is about 44,000 and the park is pretty spacious and has an open air feel to it. (It's pretty easy to locate your seat as well)\n\nConcessions are numerous (please, try the Crab Fries (delicious)! I had to google it before I bought some because I had no clue as to what they were...you know, I'm from Brooklyn, so, how would I know?) and a couple of the smaller food stands take cash only. Oh, you can bring in unopened (non-alcoholic) beverages. So, buy some water etc outside the stadium. The size of bag you can bring is 16x16x8, so, if you don't want to pay $$ for ballpark food, bring your own!\n\nEveryone we came into contact with was *super* nice...even the fans. (Sorry Phillies fans, but, I was warned to not wear my Mets cap. What a bunch of b.s.. I totally could have worn it and there were a ton of Mets fans present and there were zero problems). Besides, it's not like Phillies fans are Red Sox or Yankees fans ::grin::\n\nI really enjoyed the visit and would totally come back to CBP! \n\n\nPS- can't we get rid of the corporate naming of baseball stadiums and call them by a fan- voted favorite team player instead? Let's call CBP,  Mike Schmidt Stadium, eh?\n\n*So, If you're attending a sunny day game, bring a towel or something to sit on because those plastic seats have been baking in the sun and you'll burn you butt.", "date": "2016-07-19 13:54:40"}, {"_key": "109670", "_id": "reviews/109670", "_rev": "_fNyp7Qa--X", "review_id": "wNh2PSth8t4xRzRTUtcfXw", "user_id": "hpw7UrWf51aaWKbaGGJ2hA", "business_id": "-Or44IdY51Ukd618kikmtA", "stars": 3, "useful": 7, "funny": 1, "cool": 4, "text": "I'm glad folks from Philly and the surrounding area are calling this place out for being overpriced and over-hyped so that I don't have to look too much like a regional hater, but Federal Donuts continued the trend of our last visit of places that failed to meet our expectations. Luckily none of the food was bad (the service however was terrible), but really nothing stood out as good enough to justify the markup their charging for the experience. We had tried to go to the Pennsport location first, but they closed just as we arrived (3PM closing time seems odd, no?), so we wound up here, and maybe that location is better or something.\n\nDue to their proximity, we wind up with a lot of Philly natives down in DC, and as a result there's this constant bickering about cities, so when 2 different fried chicken and donut places opened up in DC a few years ago there were of course cries of \"idea theft\" from Federal Donut lovers. Well, I can say with a good bit of certainty, that not being from either town (although I do now reside in DC), both operations in DC (Astro and GBD) are a far superior product than what we had from this Federal Donuts. The creative donuts are more creative, and made better, and the chicken is fried better. Whether or not they \"stole\" the idea of combining 2 of the country's most beloved items is absurd, I'm sure many of us did that in our dorm rooms, but ultimately all that matters is the end product, and Federal Donuts falls short in that regard for me.\n\nAs for the donuts, we tried the blackberry walnut, marshmallow squared, and chocolate glazed, along with one of their \"fresh\" made basic donuts, since Suzy isn't really into the fancy flavors. The cake consistency of each of the fancy donuts was well done, but they all just tasted kind of plain. I believe they just use the same cake batter for almost everything and then simply dip it in whatever the flavor is, rather than baking the flavor into the mix. This results in somewhat of a Dunkin Donuts feel to the product, at a much higher premium. The guy doing the fresh donuts was having a good bit of trouble actually making a circle, so Suzy had to keep going back repeatedly to check for her donut (we were literally the only non-employees in the building at the time). Coupled with the fact that he seemed to have a good bit of difficulty answering any questions she had about the menu items, this left us even less impressed with the staff than the actual food.\n\nThe fried chicken was somewhat better than the donuts in terms of execution. We chose one dry option and one glazed, and I'm fairly certain I wound up consuming the lion's share of it all (no surprise to anyone who knows my background). The za'atar seasoning was nice and heavy on the chicken, adding lots of flavor, but the chicken itself was a bit too dry. The chili garlic was somewhat excessive, I would prefer to not need an entire roll of paper towels to make through an order of 6 wings. It was hard to get a feel for the chicken itself when you're having to scrape off giant chunks of sauce. It just felt sloppily composed, or just lazily executed. It was nice they include a basic donut with each order, to give you something to balance the flavors, but would have been even nicer if it mentioned that on the menu so that we could have adjusted our donut order accordingly.\n\nI don't recall exactly what our total for a few donuts and a dozen wings (and maybe a soda and a water) was, but it was somewhere between $30-40, which is fairly ridiculous considering the simple approach to everything. If they were huge yeast donuts (like at Doughnut Plant, VooDoo, or GBD) then maybe I could understand, but these donuts lack that level of effort. To top it off their register has one of those annoying \"tip screens\" that you have to go through before signing for your credit card purchase.

FG's one patty $3.69 w/cheese $4.29, Jake's one patty is $2.99 w/cheese $3.29. FG's two patties is $5.19, w/cheese $5.79, Jake's double burger is $4.20 w/cheese $4.89,\n\nJake's uses frozen fries, boo, where Five Guy's makes them fresh in house and Five Guy's win hands down on the fries. Jake's does offer cheese fries or chili fries, where Five Guy's does not. Again a big difference in price for those on a budget. Although, I would not order Jake's fries again.

Take me to Citizens Bank Park!  Buy me some cheesesteaks and BBQ!  Crab fries, soft pretzels;  Ump, what did you do!?!\n\n I am a huge fan of baseball. It is one of my loves and my favorite sport, by far. Even though I am a huge Braves fan ( oh, shut up ), I enjoy watching any team play. However, when the Braves come to Philly, I meet them at Citizen's Bank Park. \n\nHaving lived from one corner of the USA to the next and being an extensive traveler, I have been to many stadiums around the USA, including Philly's previous Veteran's Stadium. Citizen's Bank Park is, without a doubt, the most sophisticated baseball stadium I have visited. There are three floor levels, from the main floor to the third floor you can easily reach it via an open outdoor escalator.  There are also elevators for folks who choose to use them.\n\nI've entered through different gates and I never fail to see amusements for the kids. The park staff is very friendly to all who enter their gates, but for the kiddies, they have slides, pitching balls, face painting and so much more! http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/phi/ballpark/not_your_typical_ballpark.jsp#kids My granddaughter was picked to be on first base last year and got to stand along with the Phillies first baseman, Ryan Howard, she also has an autographed ball by him!  She was on TV and thank heavens my son, who is a huge Phillies fan, taped the game! \n\nThis stadium has more concession stands and eateries than I have ever seen at any stadium, be it football or baseball. You want food, they've got it!  Citizen's Bank Park food offerings, redefines Ballpark cuisine!   I have tried most of these places and be it a cheesesteak, crab fries, kielbasi, hot dogs, piled high sandwiches or BBQ, you will leave here filled with satisfaction. Bull's BBQ is the largest grill in all of major league baseball's stadiums. It has an outdoor picnic area and grills and BBQ's anything from turkey, pork, beef and sausages to chicken. http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/phi/ballpark/concessions.jsp \n\nIn honor of the recently deceased Harry Kalas, they had paid homage to him with Harry The K's, which has served beverages and foods from finger food to an upscale menu. McFadden's which is a sit down eatery and Sports bar is conveniently accessed from both inside and outside of the enclosed park. \n\nI am there to watch the ballgame, food is brought to you, as well as beverages, constantly! If and when I do venture away from my seat to grab a bite, I still do not miss the game, thanks to the numerous screens and shouts from the stands. \n\nSeating is comfortable with a lot of leg room, wide screen TVs adorn this open stadium and beautiful displays of a lit up replica of the Liberty Bell, which rings every time the Phillies hit a home run. Guests also enjoy a fantastic view of the Center City skyline. Oh, by the way, that is real grass on the field.\n\nTickets can be purchased in advance and online.  This year  they have a new package that includes your ticket for the game and a $10.00 food voucher than can be used at any stand or eatery.  They sell for $32.00 -$34.00.\n\nOne thing that I will never forget and that is how badly I wanted Chipper Jones to autograph a baseball, for my Grandson.  He refused, right in front of my grandson. Later, as we sat behind the dugout, we watched a line form and who came out, Chipper Jones to sign at least 20 balls. Since then I have bought his baseball and bat, but it killed me to do so. As we were walking towards the parking lot, after the game left out, we passed the area where the Phillies players were leaving, Jim Thome got out of his Hum V and signed quite a few balls.  I gave mine to my son, since he is a big fan, but I will never forget those two episodes.   \n\nThe way I look at it, if you do not find love for this stadium, it is because you are jealous or envious. \n\nEvery time I walk into Citizen's Bank Park, I am loving it and knowing that my next few hours will be full of good times and good eats.

Loaded with spicy shredded pork, rice, beans, peppers, onions, bits of corn, peas and carrots here and there, yes Americanized, but awesome. You do find them with these fillings in the SW, but in Mexico it is a basic spicy meat, rice and beans. Truly remarkable and this alone will bring me back. \n\nThe tamale was wrapped in an real corn husk instead of one of those plastic imitations you find today. The masa filling or corn dough was very dry and bland, there was one good sized chunk of white meat pork in the center and nothing else. The dough was pure white, which makes me wonder if they even attempted to add chili powder or cumin to the mixture and it desperately needed salt and pepper. In an attempt not to waste food, I spooned a good quarter of a cup of salsa on it that was loaded with peppers. Still not loving it, I spooned some refried beans on, I came this close to topping it with guacamole and decided that my stomach had enough. \n\nThe refried beans are good, but once again needed salt and pepper. I always Americanize them anyway by adding raw onion and cheddar cheese. The fresh guac was loaded with chunks of avocado, a nice balance of citrus and tomatoes with a bit of heat, I detected no red onion, but it did taste as if they put onion powder in it. It was still very good and they claim it is award winning. \n\nTorn between the mango salsa or the fruit salsa, I chose the fruit, since it had large chucks of peach and mango in it, as well as blueberries, strawberries, pineapple and sweet red peppers. Well this tall young man who was scooping out my fresh fruit salsa kept knocking the chunks of mango off the spoon. I finally told him to knock it off, not really, but I did ask what he was doing and asked for mango! I mean come on, give it up if you want me to return. It was very good and fresh, a bit vinegary \n\nThey also have a black bean salsa, beans and rice and beautiful looking layered cheese, imported cheese and chorizo, which I do need to try. They carry flour tortillas, as well as corn and a variety of corn chips, canned sauces and peppers. The feta and lime salsa is on my list to try the next time. \n\nThe Chicken Enchilada is small but excellent! Just the right amount of heat and filled with shredded chicken and spices. Of course after my initial bite, which was good enough, I topped it with cheese, heated it a bit more to melt it and added some hot salsa and some fresh guacamole, yum! \n\nThey really do have a great menu of four different taco's, quesadillas, eight burritos including a breakfast one with egg and chorizo, nachos galore, empanadas, chimichangas, Chile rellenos, shrimp cerbice, Mexican slaw and Mexican Jarrito to drink as well as state side soda pops. Hot platters are served with sides. \n\nAll of these Mexican specialties are to each come with sour cream, guacamole and Pico de gallo, when I got home and opened my bag the tall, handsome young man who was hoarding the mango did not give me any, not one little dollop and I'm telling! It was a good thing that I had sour cream and salsa at home and bought the guacamole. Open Thursday through Saturday only. \n\nAdmittedly I over ordered and ate this for days while hubby had two Cornish game hens, corn on the cob and wild rice. I was not jealous and of course I had to make a batch of margarita's to wash it all down.

Michael ordered the eggs benedict which can also be ordered eggs Florentine. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the ham was nice and thick with a beautifully made hollandaise sauce. He had asked for them to add onions and peppers to his home fries and they were happy to oblige. He was thrilled with his order and raved over the home fries in particular. As a side he ordered bacon and their bacon is not wonderful, it was thin and very soft.\n\nI loved their hand cut fries and you get enough to feed an army! Three pieces of fish topped my huge plate of fries, the breading was way too thick and not cooked on the inside, even though the fish was cooked perfectly throughout.

I started eating Ted Peter's Famous Smoked Fish Spread back in the early 70's. My aunt and uncle moved here from Chicago, and when we came to visit there was always a quart of fish spread (and a big bag of saltines and Crystal hot sauce) waiting for us. Flash forward to the early 80's when I moved here (I was in my early 20s). In response to an ad in the paper, I actually tried to get a job at Ted Peter's in the smoke house, but was told I was too young and probably would not be able to get to work on time. I forget the exact time, but they started smoking EARLY. I thought it the perfect job, where I could work in the morning and hit the beach in the afternoon. I was crushed, but they were probably right. \n\nI don't live in Florida anymore, but I do still visit the area (at least once or twice a year). Ted Peter's is one of those absolutely positively \"have to\" stops that gets made when returning to this area. Sometimes more than once... And sometimes there's still a container of fish spread waiting for me in the fridge at home (though the \"to go\" crackers and hot sauce are not passed out as generously). \n\nWhen dining in, and in addition to the fish spread with crackers, the three things I recommend are: The smoked fish spread sandwich, any of the smoked fish entrees (ask your server for details, as some are more \"fishy\" than the others), or the burger (for you less adventurous types). Oh, and the German Potato Salad is quite good too. \n\nDraft Beer (Miller High Lite - The Champagne of Beers) is served, but only with meals. And at $2.50 a mug, you won't want to drink much here anyways... Oddly, root beer (which is very good) is also $2.50 a mug (but I think you get free refills). Oh, cans and bottles of other beers is also available. \n\nI've never had problem with service, and even if you do, you (should be) on vacation.

Given that this was close to where we were staying (the Marriott), it was easy to pop out and roll over to 21st Amendment, which was only a few minutes away. There wasn't a line outside, but it was packed by the time we made it inside (sometime between 10-11 PM)...standing-room only, with the seats at the high-top tables and the bar taken. The decor and ambiance is a bit more retro, but like all New Orleans spots in this fashion, it feels homey, and it was enhanced by the fact that the band in the bar playing live music was absolutely entrancing the audience, with some folks even doing some dancing right at the front.\n\nThat said, I did come here initially because it was rated highly for drinks, and on that front, the cocktails do not disappoint. The bartenders make the drinks expertly, whether you stay on-menu or stray off by giving some general preferences. The beer selection is more generic, with specific bottles being the big-label brands, and no names given for listings like 'seasonal' or 'IPA'. Nonetheless, the drinks are made quickly but consistently - something I appreciated given how busy it was that night. Pricing was reasonable, relatively speaking - $13 a cocktail is a bit expensive, but the quality was very good, making it a bargain compared to some places in New York that I have been to.\n\n21st Amendment really has a nice cozy feel to it, and with great drinks and great music, it's hard to go wrong. It doesn't have the kind of 'fun' you'd find half a block over on Bourbon Street, but at my age, it's the kind of fun that I'd rather have.

Being in the middle of the afternoon, there wasn't a long line, and getting seating inside wasn't too hard either. The vibe is pretty relaxed, with a spacious feel, some industrial finishes, and spacious booths, bar seating, and some outdoor spots as well if you want to sit down. Most of the attention was focused on the donuts, but as the name suggests, they also serve sandwiches and coffee here - so a little bit of everything for everyone. We ended up sticking with donuts, trying out the chocolate glaze, spicy maple praline, and cookies and cream.\n\nHow'd it shake out? To be honest, I was a bit underwhelmed given the hype that I had seen on here (and other places on the Internet). The donuts are very much on the thicker and denser side, and outside of the maple praline, I didn't think the frosting really stood out relative to other donuts I have had. I do have a soft spot in my heart (and belly) for maple donuts, which explains why I liked that the best flavor-wise - but it also didn't have any hint of spiciness at all, which makes me wonder why the description even bothered. The chocolate glazed donut was very average to me, and the cookies and cream was also pretty generic...there was only a small sprinkling of cookies on top.\n\nOverall, the donuts are different from what you'd pick up at a Krispy Kreme or Dunkin' Donuts, but it didn't measure up to the uniqueness (and tastiness) of other donut-centric shops that I have been to. I would like to come back and try the sandwiches, which looked tasty, but from a donut standpoint, I came away full but a bit disappointed relative to expectations.", "date": "2017-12-16 23:02:22"}, {"_key": "92638", "_id": "reviews/92638", "_rev": "_fNyp9fW---", "review_id": "dyy86Ey_gT-lRMaeyM6mwQ", "user_id": "CJmtS1Uk1KSsY2MWol_E7g", "business_id": "g04aAvgol7IW8buqSbT4xA", "stars": 3, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "I ate here with brunch on the last morning in town before heading back home. This is a pretty popular spot for brunch, and given the small space, you'll likely have to wait a little bit of time before getting seated. There was about a 15-20 minute wait before our group of 5 got seated, which, considering the tiny space, was not all that bad. It has a bit less charm than other spots in the French Quarter, and it does feel a little bit divey. Our waiter was alright, but he didn't understand my question about orange juice, and somehow my hashbrowns were forgotten entirely when my Big Easy Breakfast was brought out (everyone else ordered the same dish, and it included them).\n\nSpeaking of our food, the Big Easy Breakfast is pretty much what you'd expect a standard breakfast to be - pancakes, eggs, breakfast meats, home fries, and toast. It's relatively cheap, but the food is quite average. The pancakes were a bit overcooked, with the outside being a bit overcrisped and dark. The eggs were over-easy - hard to do wrong - and the home fries were a tad buttery but pretty solid. Toast - quite bland. The sausage was decently flavored, but the bacon was a tad undercooked.\n\nIt's possible that the more regional brunch dishes are better-prepped and more representative of the local cuisine, but the food was pretty average overall.

That said, once the music gets going, and the musicians are deep into their sets, improvising and getting their groove on - you forget about all that other stuff and live with the music. All of the guys playing had impressive skills, and the band played a few different types of jazz and swing during their set.\n\nThere may be other great places to listen to music in NOLA, but Preservation Hall is a must-do if it's your first time here.

The famous one is Smoken Dudes around town, and I was not really impressed by the taste or the prices, so I'm glad that we saw the sign for Ben's BBQ - which by the way is VERY easy to miss, since it is located inside the hotel and the sign is not upfront in on Street Road at all, so make sure you just pull into the Best Western Hotel after the Dunkin Donuts.\n\nAlright, well the location situation aside, because it is kind of awkward to walk into a hotel and not be staying there, but walk into the back just to eat. The restaurant area looks like a hotel lobby that wasn't given the full permission to be a BBQ pit. I was thrown off by that situation a lot, especially because it didn't even smell like BBQ! But, loyal to my review reading, I still decided to give it a shot. There was a wonderful bartender, an older woman, who was taking our order and gave us great recommendations. \n\nI decided to go with the coffee rubbed brisket - because omg that sounded amazing and the hubby went with the smoked sausage which was keilbasa for the day. Let's just say if I could eat this coffee smoked brisket everyday for the rest of my life, it might still not be enough! It was melt in your mouth good, with a smokey, but sweet flavor, just perfection. The hubby's kielbasa was great flavor too, neither one of us wanted to share our plates! As for the sides, the Mac n cheese was creamy and out of this world! And the baked beans were like I've never had, also amazing.

The natural flavors of the ingredients are on the forefront and not over-powered or masked by heavy sauces. My friend got one of the vegan wraps \"Primo Vegetarian\". It has sauteed Veggies, mixed Greens, cous cous, Daiya vegan cheese, and \"Zoink\" sauce. I tried \"The Scallywag\" which has seared scallops, snow Peas, mushrooms, cous cous, parmesan cheese, and lemon champagne sauce. All of the ingredients were cooked well, super fresh, and the light champagne sauce brought everything together.\n\nWhile everything was fresh, it took waaaaaaay too long to get the food... much longer than a wrap should take. On the plus side - the food is good and healthy as opposed to a lot of food trucks where you feel like you need to add an extra couple hours on the treadmill the next day. HOWEVER, is it worth the wait? I personally don't think so because it's not a new concept, it's not mind-blowingly delicious and it's not difficult to prepare.

Several others in our group ordered the Jabroni which was loaded with two patties, pancetta, capicola, mozzarella and a few other items I can't recall. It was definitely a heavy choice!  The hit of the night was definitely the DUDE shake. \n\nSince we were there at night we didn't get to catch the views of the golf course. The restaurant itself is certainly upscale. Since I don't golf, I don't imagine myself returning here for a meal anytime soon. It appeared as though the bathrooms also served as locker rooms for women, which were not very clean. Perhaps this was an oversight, given that they opened up on an off-night. \n\nOver all, Cayton's was a fun choice for our group.

Sure I know my wines, but now, I'm thinking it's time to really understand beer. With the beer boom going on in the old pueblo, I don't tire of seeing more breweries hop on the scene, and Ten Fifty-Five Brewing is doing many things well! This small operation started out in a home kitchen and has wowed locals since it's debut in Tucson. They have four beers in constant rotation and plan to have six by November. And so far, so good! Actually, great! What I find especially great is the variety. They really make beer for many palates to enjoy. I typically steer away from IPAs, so lucky for me, the Lazy Duck (American Wheat) and Leap Pale Ale are light and crisp. The Leap Pale Ale is their flagship brew and in my humble opinion, a perfect beer for those that don't want a super hoppy beer. It's just the right amount! I tasted two other beers in my flight, which are not necessarily going to always be available in their rotation. The XOXO Coffee Stout (made with coffee beans from EXO Roasters) and the Pukka Bitter (British style Ale). I enjoyed both. They also make a double IPA, the Two Sons Citra, which was sold out. As mentioned earlier, this operation is quite small and carefully run by two owners, John Vyborny and Chris Squires. Both are super passionate about their craft and they're pouring some mad love into their nano-brews. Tasting hours are limited, so make sure to visit them Thursday and Friday 4pm-7pm and Saturday 2pm-7pm. They've recently expanded their space and now have more seating, a huge chalkboard menu and a tasting bar. Stop by and have flight! Meet the owners and have a chat. While small, it's cozy and welcoming and all beer drinkers-beginning or expert will be in a hoppy (pun intended) place upon first sip. Prices start at $2 for 6oz pours, growlers are $8. If you can't make it into the brewery for a visit, you can find their beer at several local restaurants including Playground, The Good Oak, La Cocina, Tap & Bottle, Zona 78 Hacienda del Sol, Pasco and Wilko.

We came at around 11:30am, which was perfect, because we beat the big lunch rush.  We were seated within 15 minutes, so we just enjoyed our view of the ocean while we waited.

And the whole pitcher was only $18!\n\nWe started off with an appetizer and shared a dozen of the Morrow Bay Oysters and Kusshi Oysters.

The half Maine Lobster was super fresh and tender.  The tail was a little chewy, but better than a lot of lobsters I've had lately.  My favorite part was the super meaty claw!  It came out of the shell beautifully with ease, and melted like butter in my mouth.  I didn't even need the side of melted butter!  This dish was simple and sweet.  The Lobster Bisque was good, but nothing I'd be craving.  I hoped that there would be at least a few pieces of lobster in it, but I think they just used lobster for the flavor.  Oh!

The Lobster Roll looked amazing, and it wasn't super drenched in mayo either.  I noticed that my friend didn't eat the roll-- it looked pretty basic/grocery store bought.

One was a flat out fake and one by a Montecito resident I personally know who is quite possibly mentally ill/delusional.Sadly, he got 25 notes on this review as he's a writer and funny. \n\nI forgot about it for awhile, living on the border of Montecito and SB and staying mostly on Coast Village Road. \n\nI had a great brunch here last year, trying the butternut squash pizza with the crinkly sage (flash fried I think), goat cheese, mushrooms and truffle oil . Sublime! \n\nThe new bartender , Hannah, is terrific and knows her wines. She told me the Riesling was too sweet for her and that if I liked less sweet Riesling, I'd not be happy. I tried a Sauvignon when I picked up my to go pizza and liked it so much I ended up staying for another. \n\nAbout 2 years ago, when Piatti closed, my boyfriend and I had a wonderful dinner and I remember the succotash side fondly along with a soup and appetizer but don't remember what it was specially, but definitely one of us had fish. \n\nPiatti was, well, Piatti. The best thing about it was the decor and the 7/glass Piatti cab, along with that bread basket with the chili /balsamic dipping sauce. A good budget meal with the 7/glass wine and a soup or appetizer. \n\nBut Piatti was underwhelming and probably lasted as long as it did for sentimental reasons. \n\nThe Wine Bistro is far superior both in terms of food and overall experience.

I have written dozens of Victorian Chick blogs about this complex where I spent ten most horrifying, depressed years of my life. My graduate school debacle can't be blamed on Hope Gardens, aka Death Gardens, any  more than 9/11 (which I spent in this apartment), but certainly living her during both did not give me a fighting chance. \n\nI view the following as a public service announcement to fellow Yelpers even \"thinking* about renting here. \n\nNow, I moved out in 2006. So who knows who's running the shop now. But a nice old man owned it years ago. Then his mean Manhattan real estate mogul daughter took it over. \n\nThe new paint looks like a baby's diaper with light-colored loose stool. I suppose technically it's \"sand,\" but here's a newsflash: SB ISN'T ARIZONA. In Scottsdale, you see this kind of color scheme but that's a *desert* for the love of God. \n\nNow, this ONE star is for a one-bedroom on Hope Ave itself. If you live on the indie courtyard, it will be far quieter and cooler. \n\nBut living *on* Hope Avenue is masochistic unless you're deaf. Of course when I moved in, it was a de-facto convalescent home, so presumably half the tenants were deaf or getting there. I was one of the few people under 50 and one of only two or three graduate students. \n\nIt was big for the money. But you get what you pay for. I don't like Upper State. At all. It's just a funky, weird, depressing part of town. La Cumbre is even worse and more depressing, but that's like saying it's better to lose a leg in a car wreck than a bike crash. They both suck. \n\nYou have NO concept how loud the trucks are up Hope Ave. Six days a week it seems. The only quiet day is Sunday. Come Monday, it feels like you returned to prison after a 24-hour reprieve. As if the big rigs barreling up Hope Ave to Foothill weren't enough, you have THREE major banks on the corner of Hope and State (Wells Fargo, B of A, and Montecito Bank and Trust). (The sign says \"scenic\" route but I have no clue what that means as Foothill is hardly \"scenic\" and believe me, this is some official truck route). Of course no one prepares you for the noise because they want to rent the unit.\n\nBut wait, there's more! I was sweating and showering constantly from May 1st to Oct 15th because the units on Hope Ave have sliding glass doors in the living room and large windows in the bedroom with *afternoon sun*. This is a big issue with SB apartments, given the lack of a/c: does it have afternoon sun or afternoon shade. And I'm describing a downstairs unit.\n\nIf you live upstairs, you might as well move to Texas, except that in Texas everyone-not just the 1% as in Santa Barbara--has air conditioning because it's simply an inhumane and uncivilized place to live four or so months a year. Same with Arizona. You have to have a/c. And they won't let you put in a window unit, at least they wouldn't when I lived there. \n\nWell, Hope Gardens is just like Texas or Arizona four or five months a year with the heat beating down on the glass--minus the a/c. Back in the late 1990s, portable a/c units didn't work. I bought three and the only thing I accomplished was staining the hideous light brown carpet they didn't replace because a childhood friend was at Oxford and I was simply taking over the lease. \n\nNow, the pool is okay. It's all really old people but that's cool. This is SB, for the newly wed and nearly dead. But I took to wearing earplugs 24/7 for five years. This made it impossible for me to go even to Lazy Acres or CVS without plugs in my ears. If you go this route, please learn from my experience. You will get ear infections unless you wash them regularly (earplugs aren't meant for 24/7/365) or buy a few dozen pairs and rotate. \n\nAlso know that the gardeners work on Thursdays (or one weekday) and with all that grass, you're listening to a cacophony of lawnmowers and hedge trimmers. If you're on the front like I was, you also have tree trimming to look forward to once a year. This is like Fargo without the buffets. \n\nI suppose a 9 to 5 worker will not notice this. And the traffic noise dies down by 7 or 8. \n\nI recommend drinking heavily the first two weeks of January because it's better than jumping off a building in despair that Christmas break is over, the only 10 days a year you can hear yourself think. \n\nI once read a review for a community college in Texas: \"Go here only if you have no other options in life.\" That's all I can say.

Oh, the crab is also topped with onion rings. Mind you, my experience with eating crab doesn't go beyond dungeness crab which usually breaks into lumps of sweet, crab meat.

A couple of hours in the sunshine on a boat?  What could be wrong with that?

Yet the servers are outfitted in white jackets and the inlaid floors are amazing to look at so it's upscale without being fancy- nice without being pretentious!\n\nI have to take a minute to talk about Camilla, our server.  From the moment she came over to our table we were hooked on her infectious laugh, her knowledge of the menu and the fact that she went out of her way to make sure everything was PERFECT during our visit.  Even when she found out that the specialty oysters that she had sold to us were all sold out- she got the manager to come over right away to make things right (there were plenty of others to choose from so no issue but it was just that she cared enough to make it right!)  Given this was our last night in town- we had eaten already at several of the best restaurants in town and while the food at each of them had been good- the service had not, so it was so refreshing to be taken care of by this service professional!\n\nWe had spent some time looking over the menu and decided for our appetizers that we would try one of their raw seafood towers (the Plateau de Fruits de Mar- seriously this was the cheapest seafood tower I have ever seen for the quality of the product).  For $58 you got a dozen oysters, dozen clams, dozen mussels, shrimp and about a pound of king crab along with some ceviche.  This easily fed our group of 5.

My favorite was the Blackened Shrimp that came with a Cucumber Ranch. I tried it, it was cool and refreshing, but I ate my shrimp without it. The spicy flavor, was reminiscent of the cajun seasoning I experienced in NOLA. My DP, favored the Crab Cake. It was topped with slices of grapefruit and avocado. Make sure you get a mixture of all three in every bite. It makes for an interesting combination on your palate. \n\nOur Cornmeal Waffle was a tad cold, so we sent it back. The second one was warm and served with a large scoop of soft whipped butter. I enjoyed the texture of the cornmeal and the taste, but would have preferred some other type of topping in addition to the butter. Perhaps, a little cup of syrup. After all, it is a waffle. \n\nWe went in different directions on our entrees so we could each sample each others. Being a fan of catfish, I choose the Crab Stuffed Missouri Catfish. It was served on a bed of poblano grits and topped with a garlic dressing. You can not go wrong with crab and catfish in the same dish. \nIt's amazing how the older I get, the more I am developing an appreciation for grits.

My Southern and Texas friends swear it is the best ice cream on the earth. When someone says, \"Best on the earth,\" that is like throwing down the ice scoop to a challenge. \n\nThe Blue Bell is located in the front of the store. It's on the backside of the huge glass display case for the truffles, caramel apples and specialty chocolates. When I went, I was expecting maybe six or so flavors being offered on a rotating schedule. To my surprise, there were over two dozen flavors to choose from. For a brief moment I felt like a kid in a candy shop. Oh wait, I was in a candy shop, that had an ice cream parlor too. \n\nThe young lady working the counter was very patient with me, as I was having a hard time selecting my first Blue Bell flavor. I finally went with, Birthday Cake. It was a rich creamy vanilla with pieces of chocolate cake and swirls of chocolate icing and bright colored sprinkles. I'm sure you have heard, sprinkles are for winners. After enjoying my Blue Bell, I now understand not only the love the South has for this ice cream, but why the South has an obesity problem. This ice cream is too good to resist. \n\nNow, I'll talk about the RSC. This store was amazing, I had no idea they had so much to offer. They had pre-boxed, by the piece, Jelly Belly jelly beans, Weight Watchers candy and some the most decadent caramel apples. This is a great place for picking up a gift for that special Aunt, Grandma or person that stumps you every time on what to get them. \n\nPersonally I prefer local chocolates, Kakao and Bissinger's, but for gifts and Blue Bell, I will keep this candy store on my shopping list.", "date": "2015-03-18 18:18:23"}, {"_key": "34669", "_id": "reviews/34669", "_rev": "_fNyp72e--l", "review_id": "udyIKGDdArCh00gi353TbQ", "user_id": "bYENop4BuQepBjM1-BI3fA", "business_id": "vXpMmtc6-m3YiUe6ze44pw", "stars": 4, "useful": 8, "funny": 3, "cool": 5, "text": "Wow, this is the best Marshalls I have ever shopped.

Being able to have all three is like winning the Triple Crown. \n\nI work weekends, so Monday was my only chance to experience the festival. Determined to beat the crowds we arrived early and got Prince parking in the garage. Actually it was so damn good, I'd call it parking for a King. It wasn't luck, we just got there REAL early. In fact, we had to wait for them to set up and get ready to open. \n\nFor those of you who have never attended this Greek Festival, visualize Six Flags or Disney World without the rides. To make it easier for all the attendees, maps are provided with menus from each booth. Arriving early paid off, we were able to read the menus and get in line early. Not being too smart, we got beers and sat at a hightop table and people watched. Before we knew it, some of the lines were already 20+ deep. We immediately got in line at the Athenian Garden Deli, because we knew we wanted chicken wings and a Shish-Kebob. \n\nFor a church festival I am always amazed at how high of quality of food that is being served. These wings were huge, tender and seasoned oh, so well. Our Shish-Kebob was marinated tenderloin, seasoned with lemon and herbs, grilled on skewers over hot coals. The tenderness of the tenderloin, again surprised me for a church parking lot festival.\n\nTo satisfy our sweet tooth's we enjoyed a Loukoumades which is a Grecian beignet covered with honey and nuts. Having one of these, you will go nuts. It is sticky and sweet from the honey and the nuts give it a slight salty tang. \n\nIn addition to the Loukoumades, we had a Baklava Sundae. Don't judge us, there were two so having two desserts is like having one each. The sundae they claim was, tasty low calorie vanilla ice cream topped with crumbled baklava pieces. The Tweens ordering ahead of us, added Hershey's Chocolate Syrup on top. So when I ordered, she asked if I wanted it as well. I told her, \"No, that would be blasphemous.\" The little old man working the soft serve machine laughed and said that he totally agreed with me. I hope that ice cream was low calorie, because it needed to balance out the calorie intake of the best Baklava I have ever had at a Greek restaurant or festival. \nWe both were on sugar highs after chowing down two desserts.

After we received our beer and cider orders, we placed our gargantuan order for two: the Tuscan style Tavern fries, which was HUGE, the chips and guacamole and the fish and chips. Obviously, the healthy factor was not an issue.\n\nEverything was tasty, just in huge portions. The Tavern fries were easy to munch on, although there was way too much. We probably could have ordered this alone. But I guess if an order of fries cost $6.50, I wouldn't expect just a small tin.\n\nThe guacamole was interesting. The goat cheese gave it a different flavor - but I liked it. There were so many chips but at the same time, there was a lot of guac. \n\nThe fish and chips wasn't bad, not mind blowing either. It was so greasy I could only take several bites before calling it quits. I love when my fried fish is super tender and juicy, but this was a bit much.

If you're a foodie and/or a hipster, forgo the meat and three and BBQ and meander over to East Nashville for a dining experience. Here's why I loved Butcher & Bee:\n\n1) The food- It's a small plate concept with the majority of dishes being vegetable based (though they do have some meat options). My friend and I ordered four small plates and a dessert to share and we left content. A few stand outs: The whipped feta is their signature. It is good, but if you don't like feta to begin with, order something else. Avocado crispy rice- It's more salad with a whole avocado mixed in and crunch North Carolina rice. Butternut squash soup- Bold flavors with a pomegranate seed garnish. Meat balls- comes in a triad and has cheese and bread crumbs mixed in. The chocolate pot de creme with chili was good, but not sweet (In case you're obsessed with sugar like me).\n\n2) The atmosphere- It's slick and the simple art around the restaurant is perfectly placed. We sat at the small table in front of their logo painted on the wall and several Instagrammers stopped by to snap a photo. Warning: The light is low so it doesn't make for the best photos.\n\n3) The location- It's just off of Main Street in East Nashville within walking distance to other Nashville finds like Edley's BBQ and Family Wash. \n\n4) The service- It's the South so it was friendly, but not in a fake or annoying way.\n\nIf you want a good Nashville dining experience that's on the cutting edge of Nashville's food scene pivot, go to Butcher and Bee. Just don't Google it because you'll find it's NOT a local joint (It's from Charleston, South Carolina).", "date": "2017-10-05 04:56:23"}, {"_key": "31687", "_id": "reviews/31687", "_rev": "_fNyp7vO--D", "review_id": "HXI9dNBAfwDnXPuYp1rSUg", "user_id": "RlXfOTtpgTfcisRmukrGbw", "business_id": "6tkLSbQ_EPc6PM9vGrHK8A", "stars": 3, "useful": 0, "funny": 2, "cool": 0, "text": "This target is HUGE, tidy and clean.

It's still down a dark alley off of South Street and in a house (the owners' house) Things have slightly changed- Marrakesh is still dim, and served as a 5-course eat-with-your-hands dinner family style, (as if in Morocco)  surrounded by tons of Middle Eastern decor- runs, lamps, the works. The servers are the owners- a couple who loves to keep it traditional. \n\nI called ahead for seating at 8pm but it seems as though we could have just walked in- we ate upstairs.  You have to ring the bell to get in. We came on Sunday but it was relatively busy- downstairs was full but upstairs not so much. Maybe it was because we were upstairs...but I felt service lacked a bit (we had to ask for water a few times, etc but I couldn't hold it against the one server- the wife). On Fri and Sat, there are belly dancers. \n\nIf you're new to this kind of thing, they do a good job explaining the process. First, they ran your hands through soapy water from their majestic-looking teapot. Next, they explain the menu and ask you to choose between 1 or 2 course for dishes 3 and 4. You don't have a lot of flexibility.. so I am not sure how vegetarians would fare. \n\nWe ate:\n\n1) Course 1- three salads: picked carrots, cucumbers and an eggplant puree- like a babaganoush. This was very tender, salty and good- the others were not as fancy but very tasty. A large tangine looking thing comes around for you to grab pita. The pita is ok- it's not warm, it's not fluffy but you can't win them all (and it's important not to fill up too much on this)\n\n2) Course 2- Very interesting kind of Moroccan...quiche? It's basically a flaky pastry topped with confectioner's sugar that houses egg, chicken, nuts...and some other things. It was overwhelmingly eggy, but tasty. Not my favorite dish but had to give it points for creativity and uniqueness.  The flaky dough was delish- very similar to that of the Green Spinach Pie.\n\n3) Course 3- was our choice between two chicken (chicken with lemon olive oil or spicy cumin)- of course we did spicy cumin! It was fall right off the bone- so tender as I'm sure it was slow cooked for hours. It's also half a chicken so you get the breast, thigh and wing. The sauce was not too spicy, I thought, but the cumin flavor is smoky and present. The sauce is pretty slathered across the meat- and yes you can refill up on pita if you're not into eating meat solo. \n\n4) Course 4- is a choice between beef or lamb and since I don't do red meat, I passed on this. My bf ordered the lamb though and said it was very tender and yummy- and sweet. It was topped with almonds and something else that made it sweet. \n\n5) Course 5- Dessert!  You get fresh fruit and baklava (one piece each). Usually I think baklava is too sweet for me but this one was pretty good- and not too oily. I mean, yes, it was very oily but it wasn't like...drenched in oil. It was pretty flat, cripsy and full of that nutty goodness that you make baklava. Bf said it wasn't nutty enough for him. Again, the flaky dough wins. \n\nThe fresh fruit was also a plus- except our apple was bruised so we didn't eat that. We took our orange for breakfast the next day. There were two strawberries (not really regional, ha) and giant seedless grapes that were almost frozen because it the fruit platter came with a chunk of ice. This was almost like a cornucopia..they really do make you feel like emperor and empress haha!\n\nThe meal is well paced (slow) so you have time to breathe.  They sell only a few house wines by the glass; otherwise you get it by the bottle (there are a few varieties at $30 ish, as well as liquor and the like). My bf got two glasses of red wine- the burgandy. It was actually fruity and full of body, which was a plus. I ordered the traditional rose drink which I actually wouldn't recommend- it was really, really sweet. It was like rose syrup (sweet enough), with sugar and water..it was too sweet and at $5, I was upset I couldn't finish it. \n\nThis place accepts cash only and is $25 per person.

I asked if I could get some pizza sauce on the side to dip it in and was ready to pay because hay, its the airport where they gouge you on pretty much everything. To my surprise, they didnt charge me. I guess nice workers do exist at airports. Unfortunately, this was the only positive highlight. \n\nOverall, I dont think I will eat at this place again any time soon. I can more than afford to lose a few pounds or 20. Put something with actual garlic on the menu and maybe we can talk about dining here.\n\nYelp 2016 Review #12 \"Vampires dont worry about this place.

Gag me with the figurative spoon, please!\n\nThat said, I LOVE EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT THIS RESTAURANT!!!\n\nJosh Lawler (ex-Chef de Cuisine at the famous farm-restaurant Blue Hill at Stone Barns in NY) and his lovely wife Colleen have created another one of what Philly does so much better than any other city in the world: an intimate, casual-yet-classy, food-centric BYOB that will undoubtedly be joining the likes of Blackfish, Bibou, Fond and Matyson on everyone's top 10 lists.  In fact, Chip Roman himself highly recommended this restaurant to us (and having been Josh's roommate at Drexel Culinary, Chip also doesn't pass up a chance to give props in the press to his new competition), so it was only a matter of time before our wine group made a pilgrimage here.  Undoubtedly the first of many...\n\nFF is an intimate, ~30 seat BYOB on Pine Street, with fairly easy parking at a couple of lots within a few minute walk.  Inside, it's quite charmingly appointed and hits the sweet spot between casual and formal, making it the perfect places for an intimate romantic dinner, or a casual get together with friends over a good bottle of wine.  All the tables are square, white cloth 2-tops, but they can be arranged to accommodate various size groups, including our spacious table for 8.  In contrast to many tiny BYOBs, FF is actually quite roomy--they could probably have squeezed a table or two more, and there is plenty of room to carry on a private conversation or fit your wine and glasses on the table (excellent Guy DeGrenne stems from France).  I think I had 6 glasses in front of me, without problem.\n\nFF has an interesting, short, constantly changing menu (depending on what they have in; and not having either a fridge or freezer, this is an absolute necessity!) divided up into 3 courses of increasing size, each having 4-6 choices, plus a special or two.\n\nWe decided to make things difficult for the staff and came up with our own tasting menu, having bigger dishes plated into smaller individual portions to share, and changing up the order of things to better match the wines we had brought (I've uploaded photos for all the dishes):\n\nBread: Warm rolls, supposedly Parker House-style (although they look more like a muffin) with a crispy exterior and delicate interior, were spread with perfect, lightly salted homemade butter.  After Bibou, the best butter in Philly.\n\nFirst course: Grilled Spanish mackerel, with shaved fennel, warm citrus vinagrette, pine nuts and grainy mustard.  WOW!  Let me repeat this: WOW!!!  The Beet steak gets all the love, but this was the DOTN (dish of the night).  Quite simple to read it, and seemed like a mish-mash of ingredients, but the sum of the parts was knock-your-socks-off.  Each bite was a different experience, citrus one moment, earthy nuts the next.  A lovely match with the SB.\n\n~Preceded by a 1996 Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Champagne Brut La Grande Dame and served with 2009 Merry Edwards Russian River Valley Sauvignon Blanc\n\nSecond course: Handmade pappardelle with Wyebrook Farm pork shoulder ragu, fennel seed and Parmigiano-Reggiano.  An nice dish, with a good porky flavor to the ragu.  I would order it again, but this was probably the least notable of our courses.  However, the 3 Corners was an unbelievably great bottle of Pinot, massive leather & smoke on the nose, midway between New World and Burgundy, with a long, long finish (WOTN).\n\n~Served with 2005 J. Rochioli Pinot Noir Three Corners Vineyard & 2005 J. Rochioli Pinot Noir Little Hill\n\nThird course: Josh's signature dish of bloody beet steak, with yogurt, shallots, pan drippings, aged balsamic and amaranth.  Yes, this is worthy of being a signature dish, with a rich, meaty texture and flavor that prompted us to move it back in the lineup and pair it with a couple of Chateauneuf-du-Papes and a cab (I think the latter was the best match).  But, sorry, I still think that mackerel was The Man!\n\n~Served with 2004 Clos de Papes Chateauneuf-du-Pape & 2003 Domaine du Pegau Chateauneuf-du-Pape (didn't catch the bottling) & 2002 Dominus Napanook Red.  The Pegau was a very fine wine with lots of saddle leather and barnyardy hay on the nose.\n\nFourth course: Rare New York venison with farmer's cheese spaetzel.  This was apparently a entree special for which there were only two plates left, so we split a slice each.  Perfectly tender, perfectly rare, on crispy/chewy spaetzel.\n\n~Served with more of the 3 reds above.\n\nOK, running out of space, so click the link below for Part 2 of my review:", "date": "2012-03-05 00:35:39"}, {"_key": "78391", "_id": "reviews/78391", "_rev": "_fNyp9GS--V", "review_id": "Uv66K9Uz_QBd_Eh-Gq3FtA", "user_id": "xc1opNkFCnAjsPXs7jqtfg", "business_id": "1DkolDhbc0kydORZCIp7Fw", "stars": 4, "useful": 3, "funny": 1, "cool": 2, "text": "South Street's Night Market, 8/15/13 (see photos):\n\nI've been traveling, so this was the first Night Market I've made since Chinatown last year.

The traffic heading down Pine St was a disaster (whether due to South Street being closed, the Eagles game, or maybe it always is at rush hour).  I tried to park in that big indoor lot on Lombard between 2nd & 3rd, but it was full (did find one of the last spaces across the street, TG).\n\nGetting to Night Market early is definitely a good plan, since after an hour the lines start to get really long for the best trucks.

It was difficult to decide and when I did make a choice I thought wistfully of roads not taken.  Though many things tempted me, I went w/ the grilled cheese sandwich and tomato bisque.  Alan ordered the tri tip slider, a house made cheddar biscuit, scrambled egg, arugula, jalape\u00f1o jam, served w/ country hash.  He ordered coffee and I ordered Lady Earl Grey tea.\n\nThe tea was served in a French press-type device.  We had whole milk on the side for both coffee and tea.  My tea cup was tall, graceful white porcelain.  The contents of the press just filled it.  The tea was very tasty.  When our dishes arrived they looked beautiful.  My sandwich contained tea smoked tomato, pulled mozzarella, brie,\nparmesan rubbed bread, mint cashew pesto.  It was luscious and generous enough to share bites w/ Alan and still be too much for me to finish.  The tomato bisque was dark and subtly smokey, w/ occasional chunks of tomato.  It was my childhood comfort food grown up and elegant.  Alan gave me a taste of his biscuit and it was delicious.  He loved the dish, although he found the finely diced potatoes disappointingly bland, lacking onions, peppers or anything else to give them interest.

If we cracked the books on human lunch behavior I'd guess that we'd see a spike in pizza eating on Fridays (lower stress) and Mondays (higher stress).

They've maintained their commitment to local beer (probably because people are finally drinking it).

ALL WERE EXCELLENT.  The waitress waited to see if I liked he matcha because she warned that it's not very sweet and said she could make it sweeter if I preferred but I'm a matcha monster and this was exactly what I was looking for :-)  \n\nNext up, they brought out a couple of small appetizers for us to share in celebration of their opening - spring roll, tempura shrimp, and a dry garlic rib:  all were excellent with my 7 year old requesting more of each!\n\nWe decided to share the dinner for 2 which came with spring rolls, chicken fried rice, 2 bowls of soup (won ton and hot & sour were both decent) and 2 entree choices:  we selected Honey Pepper Shrimp (DIVINE) and sliced Szechuan beef. \n\nBoth of the mains were good and flavourful with a good amount of sauce.  Everyone in our group noted that the use of onions was pretty heavy and more peppers, corn, carrots, etc. would be nice.  I'd say the dishes were at about 1/3 white onions - usually this is a deal breaker for me but the sauces and meat quality were superb. \n\nNext up was our never ending sampling of Dim Sum:\n\nPork Buns - $4.99 good but smaller than most; my daughter didn't care for them here  and neither did Gramma (not sure why).\n\nSticky Rice (Excellent but it only comes with 2 small leaves for $4.99 - this could be vastly improved by adding a 3rd one for that price or putting more rice in each banana leaf.  Literally, the banana leaves had less than 1/2 of the amount of rice you would have at Jumbo). \n\nBeef skewers - not as pictured and not up to snuff in my opinion for $4.99 for 2.\n\nGreen Onion Cake - $4.99 a standard that my kids will insist on every visit though I prefer mine to be a little crunchier.\n\nPan fried meat dumplings - $4.99 standard but they don't bring red wine vinegar or whatever that sauce is most Dim Sum places serve with it.\n\nCurried Squid - $4.99 Excellent and tender but I would LOVE the sauce to be a bit thicker and more plentiful to pour all over my rice :-)\n\nWe'd order 80% of the food again and to be able to have Dim Sum in St. Albert any day of the week at any time, we will most DEFINITELY be returning here.  \n\nEven if Mom and Dad want regular Chinese food, the kids in our house will jump for joy at Sticky Rice, Green Onion Cakes, and Bubble Tea!\n\nService was friendly but slow tonight with our dishes coming as much as 60 minutes apart - YIKES!

This Italian bakery is located inside of Reading Terminal Market, which is an incredible place for any kind of foodie at all.\n\nI got 4 cannoli that I would save for dinner that night. It is usually a good idea to eat a cannolo shortly after purchasing, to enjoy the crispy shell before it gets soft from the filling. The cannoli at Termini Bros. are filled on-demand (which is the ideal way). You can choose from a vanilla custard or the more traditional ricotta. My favorite pastry filling is probably sweetened ricotta, having spent most of my life eating cream puffs filled with ricotta from Mozzicato on Franklin Avenue in Hartford, CT. I asked about chocolate chips being present, as I am not a fan of this addition to the velvety smooth filling, and was informed that in fact, their ricotta mixture does have chocolate chips. Having read the reviews before coming to Termini Bros., I winced slightly and bought the cannoli anyway. At an average of 4 stars, I repeated silently to myself that 90 Yelpers cannot steer me wrong. For good measure, I also picked up tiramisu, presented in single-serving, round torte form.\n\nThat night, I helped prepare dinner for a really interesting group of people and shared my cannoli with them. I was smiling from ear-to-ear, pleased that I had not stuffed myself silly with the pork chop and orzo from dinner and glad that Yelpers did not let me down. The cannolo was delicious and the chocolate chips are actually more like shavings, not the chips that you find in your grocery store's baking aisle. This was absolutely acceptable, as I did not have to chomp on the chocolate.\n\nI had the tiramisu the next day and even though it spent a day in the fridge, it was also very good. Good coffee flavor and the delicate mascarpone paired well with the cake layers.\n\nNot only does this bakery have a decent selection of Italian pastries, cookies, and cakes, it is located in a wonderfully bustling market that makes for a fun experience.

Of course I wanted all 38 flavors that they offer but I had to be reasonable! What helped was that they offered free samples and I finally decided on cheesecake and salted caramel. I got it in a cup and although their gelato is a bit pricey, it was well worth it because the flavors were on point and the serving was pretty generous. They stuck a wafer roll in the gelato which gave it a nice touch. \n\nThey also have waffle cones and sugar cones including their Spizzico cones which are their miniature sugar cones.

Very disappointed they removed it from the menu, but from what our waiter said, it's in high demand so maybe they will bring it back! I used to take a quart of it home every visit!

Highly recommend reservations! Oh, and they will close down for private functions in case anyone is looking to throw a party of any kind. Be prepared for a more \"lively\" environment if they do have parties however. A smidge loud. Nothing we personally minded. 20% gratiuity is automatically added to tables of six or more. \n\nOur bottle was opened immediately after being seated and we were presented with knotted rolls and garlic oil right away.

There's not enough live music places in the city in my opinion. Let alone free to enter ones! This place is a great find! \n\nIt's super groovy, dark and sexy feeling up in the juke joint. Lots of candles and even a fireplace. Perfect for a night out with my love! \n\nThe cocktails were awesome and ran about $26 for two before gratuity. We chose the Lynchburg Basil Lemonade (Jack Daniels, Fresh Basil, Homemade Southern Lemonade) and the Black Cherry Gimlet (Black Cherry Vodka, Vanilla, Lime, maraschino Cherry). I honestly cannot choose a favorite! Both were carefully crafted, alcohol filled and absolutely delicious! Whiskey and Bourbon are obviously their specialty and I really loved the barrels scattered about doubling as side tables!

We can't wait to return perhaps for brunch with the kids or \"social hour\" as they call it. There's daily specials during that 5-7pm period with $4 wines, $3 brews and $4-$6 smaller plates.

So easy. \n\nMy other favorite thing about this place is the fact that it's far more than a one-stop-shop for all your postage and shipping needs. It feels very much like a community center of sorts: they sell various items from local artists (I found THE perfect wedding card for my cousin here), and they also have one of those \"take a book, leave a book\" bookcases.

I'm just being honest. \n\nThat said, Lucy's is not a bad place to have lunch if you work downtown, and I've done that on more than one occasion.

Let's talk about amazing... Because it can be found at The Fountain on Locust. I was recently in St. Louis for a work trip.

My coworker needed to eat soft things because of some dental work, so I searched \"soups\" -- little did I know that search would change my taste buds forever! Yes, as others, I am referring to the dill pickle soup! Seeing those words (as a huge dill pickle fan) had me ready to go to this restaurant fairly close to our hotel (Courtyard Marriott). \n\nWe arrived around 8 pm as a party of two and were seated within 5 minutes. (FYI-We parked on the street nearby; I'm not sure if there is a lot or not.)  We sat down with the massive menus and overwhelmed by the amazing-sounding choices. We both opted for an ice cream martini to start. It was a tough choice, but I had a Pomegranate Power (I hope that's the right name.), and she had the dreamsicle-esque one (Sorry I don't remember the names.). Both were divine! There are more drink options than you can handle between those ice cream martinis and specialty cocktails. \n\nThen it was time for food. I will say the food menu isn't nearly as large as the drink and dessert menus, but there are still many appetizing choices. Like the dill pickle soup! If you like dill pickles, you will truly be in love. I'm no chef, but this had me wanting to try to make it at home! (If I lived in the area, I'd just go to The Fountain daily, but alas!) I got a cup of it with a sandwich described as an \"adult grilled cheese.\" I probably should have had a full bowl of the soup because it was so great, but the sandwich was very enjoyable as well; it was large and a unique blend of flavors.\n\nThen it was time for dessert. What to choose? There was a display of chocolates sitting right beside me at the bar, but I opted for more ice cream! I love a sweet and salty mix, but I went for a pretzel cone with black cherry ice cream! Holy smokes. It was truly a pretzel as a cone. How cool! I love pretzels, and the ice cream was delicious as well. \n\nMy coworker also enjoyed all of her choices, and we both appreciated the service. We were wearing University of Louisville gear, and two staffers (neither being our server) came and spoke to us about living there/their trips there. Essentially, they went out of their way to be friendly. Our server was also on top of everything and kept us (and our bellies) happy! \n\nAs someone who always wants to try new things, especially when I'm traveling, I don't often say this...

It was the night of the Super Bowl so we found a restaurant with only two other guests in the dining area and just a handful at the bar. In other words, we had a restaurant to ourselves. Having a restaurant to yourself doesn't guarantee great service, but we got it anyway. Good start so far. Zea Rotisserie and Grill is great option for those looking to take a break from Po' Boys, Jambalaya's, and fried food.  What you'll find is a restaurant chain that serves seafood, sandwiches, Asian based BBQ, grilled food, and of course, rotisserie.  I can almost compare Zea to a Cheesecake Factory, but with a better food presentation and a dining experience that mimics fine dining.   \n\n-Garlic Hummus pita: This was our appetizer for the evening. I haven't had garlic based hummus before and pleased that I did. You still get the texture and taste of what you expect with hummus, but with an added buttery garlic taste to it. There's more hummus than there is pita and they are willing to hook up extra pita if needed.

The ribs are glazed with BBQ sauce and the meat is \"fall off the bone\" and \"melt in your mouth\".  As for their chicken, you get a seasoned and prepared rotisserie chicken.  Taste of their chicken rivals some of the top notch fine dining restaurants out there. Trust me.

Just right!!(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=xUPlvqixgLDiSDYGyBo_jg&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ)\n\nOther items on their menu include a BLT, which pimps a huge piece of bacon.  And let's not forget about their donuts.  I didn't try any but they looked delicious,  especially their Peanut Butter Cup.\n\nAmbiance and Service:\nPlace is small, but not tiny.  There's still plenty of room and with their tall ceilings, you don't feel too cramped.  There's also dining outside or you can choose to eat at their bar.  The line starts at the door and yes, there's a line.  Service was pretty good and the food is ready pretty quick.  \n\nAdditional Photos:\n-Peanut Butter Cup (Donut):  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=00OZAmc0oJDCtw9M06WyBw&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\n-Maple Sriracha (Donut):  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=G9CBvhRLQfqwcqGQSjMuyw&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\n-BLT (ie bacon on steroids):  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=WpaS2eV4OV6nPbvKZtvkuw&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\n-My Mark (FTF):  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=L8nn50iFinhFOLuSuhA40A&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\n\n\n\n\nYELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (032/366)", "date": "2014-02-08 19:57:09"}, {"_key": "74773", "_id": "reviews/74773", "_rev": "_fNyp9_2--c", "review_id": "hA3uSd05opWm6yy5XTeHkQ", "user_id": "y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ", "business_id": "gOtY7zJ1rIu6UIHXEvh5sA", "stars": 4, "useful": 5, "funny": 4, "cool": 4, "text": "Pralines and Peanut Butter!!\n\nReview my photos and you'll see that my wish-list line of sweets include peanut butter, peanut butter, and more peanut butter.

We stopped at Southern Candymakers not once, but twice, during our weekend stay in New Orleans.  This only means that we wanted more and more is exactly what I got. \n\nWhat to expect...\n-Southern Candymakers has entrances on both sides.  I prefer that you walk through the Decatur Street side. From there, you're immediately in line to the register.  Make up your mind quick because the line goes quick. \n \n-The Selection...all sorts of goodness.  Chocolates galore!  As you get to the register, you'll get to the Pralines.  Some of the best pralines are found here.  \n\n-Pre-Boxed Treats\n\n-Souvenirs\n\nMy Selections:  Peanut Butter dominates my choices.  I'm sure the other chocolates were good, but it's all about the nutty taste of PB for me.  Love their PB Pralines, PB covered Oreo's, and the PB Pretzel.  All PB cups were a little too much for me to handle.\n\n-Peanut Butter Praline:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=uTva7BqdYwI3JfN8eY5OsA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\n-Peanut Butter Covered Oreo Cookies:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=jN748Nb2T6S-mletDtm8wA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\n-Peanut Butter Chocolate Pretzel:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ELiAwzEGyDkvWPYxac0JOw&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\n-Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=3Yinlqhp2O-Hw5OO5VeSjw&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\n-White Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Ch3Sm7fF-vBcjzosWb_DDA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\n-Peanut Butter Passion Cup:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=BFNVDZvRgAGHoi1QHkGj2Q&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nOverall, I'm giving Southern Candymakers 4 Stars for service, selection of sweets, the abundance of peanut butter choices, quality, and taste.  The only thing keeping me from giving them 5 Stars is price.  $2.50 for one peanut butter cup?!?!  \n\n\nPS:  Read Terri R's review.  She's right, you are hit with the sweet smell of sugar.  You can even smell it from outside.  Need to wake up..try walking inside Southern Candymakers. If the smell of freshly made chocolates or peanut butter doesn't wake you up, then you must be made of stone.\n\n\n\n\nYELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (033/366)", "date": "2014-02-08 20:30:35"}, {"_key": "65835", "_id": "reviews/65835", "_rev": "_fNyp8x---F", "review_id": "y0oiCnRV49qyFgiI8Sv4TQ", "user_id": "crg97ztpsfvf6VQ0y8Nx1A", "business_id": "EAGJF3Tisg2NRX03oGkmDA", "stars": 5, "useful": 5, "funny": 2, "cool": 6, "text": "Let's be real, who doesn't love cemeteries?!\nJust me?

The convention center area is big and bright and well organized. I appreciated that the elevators were divided into 2 sections, for mid-rise and high-rise floors. My room was comfortable and quiet, and I had a beautiful view to the west.\n\nI only wish the day-to-day operations of the hotel were up to the quality of the convention center itself.\n\nThe swimming pool in this hotel is unusually small. The \"rationale\" for that is that it's a convention hotel. Yet they do go out of their way to advertise the pool. \n\nThe staff here are \"message happy\" in terms of leaving messages on your phone, and if it's a message from the hotel, it won't just go away upon playing it. In that case, you have to call guest services. The first message was in regard to me. The hotel room was not in my name, but I was listed as also in the room. The hotel wanted to know how to handle any incidentals I might purchase. That, to me, seemed ridiculous. Then any day I did not request maid service, there was ANOTHER message, notifying me that I didn't get maid service (perhaps it was because I had the sign on the door?) reminding me that I could request it. I don't require maid service every day, and I went without 3 different days. You guessed it, 3 different messages, one each time, and they don't always turn the light off after that... the important phrase you have to learn to use is \"Can you please mark the message as delivered?\"\n\nIt would have been nice if there were a way to turn off the light on the temperature control. It's quite bright at night, I had to cover it with a towel. \n\nParking is way too expensive. The fee for on-site parking was $43/day. I then learned that the parking fee for cars for the SAME GARAGE, if you were in some of the other hotels in the complex, such as Spring Hill, was less (e.g., $30/day). We wound up parking our car offsite at a lot a half-mile away, for $14/day, with free in/out privileges and a complimentary (plus tips) shuttle. \n\nIf you're going to stay here, particularly for a convention, do a lot of homework in advance, because that may save you a bundle of money.", "date": "2018-07-09 23:06:17"}, {"_key": "88000", "_id": "reviews/88000", "_rev": "_fNyp9XW---", "review_id": "e0M3avMssybYLRFCZfLKFQ", "user_id": "6I042PLRiYub7RvufcqjZQ", "business_id": "GBTPC53ZrG1ZBY3DT8Mbcw", "stars": 5, "useful": 12, "funny": 5, "cool": 6, "text": "Come during 3 PM to 6 PM!!!!

And what you get for messing up your internal clock for eating? 50 cents oysters.  I had $1 oyster happy hours before but never 50 cents. And not just some cheap oysters, but NOLA's famous crazy meaty P&J oysters. Look at my photo of it. Just look. I have never seen one meatier than these at this size. If you like thinner style oysters, these might not be for you.\n\nAnd if you want it cooked instead of raw, they have the same thing for $6 for half a dozen fried ones.  I didn't have any of those because I ordered 2 dozen raw oysters for just myself. As an afterthought, I should have ordered less raw just to at least try out the fried but I liked the raw one too much.\n\nOh yea. They also have half priced drinks during happy hours too but why would you care about that right?\n\nOf course I couldn't just live on raw oysters alone so I started with a small cup of gumbo and because so many mentioned it, I fought internally between their famous burger and what some said was the best Shrimp and Grits around the area. The Shrimp and Grits won out just because it was more of a local food where a burger, no matter how good, is everywhere.\n\nI would pass on the gumbo. 3 stars. Good but there are better around the French Quarters.\n\nThe Shrimp and Grits was amazing. The Shrimp was tender. The grits was buttery smooth. There is a nice slightly charred cheesy shell on top of the sauce which I didn't get at the other place. I would say this is my second favorite Shrimp and Grits so far. Just be aware this one is with a slight french twist as per the kind of higher end restaurant that it was so it's less traditional but not far off. 4.5 stars\n\nThe staff was amazingly attentive and friendly.

Not as thick as Jack-In-The-Box so my lungs were intact, this was a wonderful mixture of really good chocolate ice cream dolloped with a cloud of whipped cream all poured-over by sticky sweet caramel. Honestly, this would've sufficed as a meal, but I was eager to explore the food menu. The only \"negative\" was that you didn't receive a little extra shake in a mixing cannister like some places.

The French fries were crispy, slightly seasoned and skiny; I liked them. The sweet potato fries were more crunchy on the outside but moist and sweet on the inside; I LOVED sweet potato fries and these didn't disappoint (no sauce needed). You only received a few lovely dark golden brown and extra crunchy medium-sized onion rings which had plenty of extra \"nubs\" to chew on. The onion stayed intact when you bit into it and didn't pull out from its batter casing.

Once we were done, we threw our trash away (didn't appear to have any wait service but plenty of trash cans). All was easy-peasy with no hiccups. \n\nParking (Free) - They shared a small elongated strip of private parking with a number of other businesses along a stretch of beach, so parking could be rough.

Maybe the beach bum in me was swept away by the scenery (it kind of was!), but this place truly had the whole package. The menu was simple, healthy, and offered that casual SoCal vibe.

Being that I'm lazy I'm combining my review for Toscana Spa and the Tuscany Suite we stayed in at the Peppermill.\n\nToscana Spa:  5 stars. \nI thought the Rib Fest would be the highlight of our trip but it turned out that the Peppermill has an amazing spa.  When first walking in I was given a tour of the three floor spa followed by a locker, robe, and sandals.  On the bottom floor there are refreshments, toiletries for shaving etc, a sauna, steam room, and private showers. The second floor has a nice relaxation room with ipods next to lazyboy style seats also with refreshments.  The third floor is co-ed where couples can sit and have lunch. There is a pool, jacuzzi, and a lot of lounge chairs to relax.  At 1pm we had an 80 minute couples massage scheduled.  My wife said the massage was really good and professional.  Apparently it was good because 30 minutes into the massage my wife said I was snoring the rest of the massage so I don't recall anything that happened. Single or married he Toscana Spa has everything you could possibly want in a relaxing afternoon.  It doesn't even involve food but I still viewed it as 5 star worthy.

Scenic paintings of Northern and Southern Italy.  Our suite was large, it had a king sized bed, chairs, furniture, and a huge window with a view of the mountains. The bathroom had a 25 inch flat screen, vanity area, hot tub, shower, double sinks, and a private area for the toilet.  The room is very comfortable and is comparable with the rooms I stay at in Las Vegas.  \n\nOverall it was a really nice first anniversary on a budget.  Reno isn't the most exciting place in the world but a nice weekend destination for Californians looking for a relaxing weekend at a nice hotel with an excellent spa.", "date": "2013-09-05 01:35:17"}, {"_key": "109415", "_id": "reviews/109415", "_rev": "_fNyp7QC--q", "review_id": "GeIW6jduNzCalj9XNukmbw", "user_id": "gVO3VZwCu54Otc7bUB33Mg", "business_id": "SdZvOwgALlSBt8A0DvVkuQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 5, "funny": 3, "cool": 3, "text": "March 31, 2014 Monday - drinks 5:15 PM\n2 adults\n\nAtmosphere - 5 stars\nFood - N/A stars\nService - 5 stars \n\nBackground - Out with a friend to have some beer and dinner after work.\n \nAtmosphere - Reminds of a large German beer hall miniaturized and without Polka band.

For over 10 years now, every Monday for Monday Night Football this has been my haunt. So it is hard for me to dissect all of the different points that I have come to know, very well, about this location. But here we go...\n\nThe food is hit and miss and always will be. Mondays they have $10 pizza (which is an excellent price for how much it feeds) but the crust is always, always under cooked due to how thick it is. So order it, but just ask for it to be extra crispy - you'll thank me. The wings are excellent, the mini-yorkies are scrumptious and if you're going green, choose the Greek. \n\nThey have the best TVs and projection screens in the city. However, someone in the last 2 years (since adopting a Scottish theme) thought it would be a \"great\" idea to put large hurricane lanterns surrounding the main bar, and thus, blocks your view. No matter where you sit, one or two lanterns are always in your way. My alum and I actually find it is quite comical that they paid someone to install these monstrosities! But, if you can get one of the really good table that faces the gigantic HD projection screen, you are aces!!\n\nNow this is perhaps the greatest tip I can impart for all the ladies out there: If it is below -20 outside you will be using the facilities in a restroom that is -5. The building was originally built with no heating to the women's loo, and it is like being in an outhouse, at the lake, in the middle of January! However, they have a two additional sets of washrooms in the building. One is brand new and located in the (closed off) old restaurant side. If you can't get into those ones, try the ones that are located on the 2nd floor (which is usually closed off because they are not ever busy enough to open the top level) but both of these are heated. \n\nLastly, I hear complaints quite often from people about the wait staff. This is the thing you must remember to have a good time; there is no waitresses, there are only models in kilts trying their best to remember to check on your table. So if you know your will need another beer in 20 minutes, order it at that moment!

I'd assume awhile considering how thick the crusts are, but still, could they not have told us?\n\nAs far as the attitude of the bartender, I have to agree with Aimee K. The girl looked like she had a blank stare on her face, and she didn't seem too pleasant to talk to. I asked her when our salad was going to come out, and her reply was, \"when we get to it.\" I went back to my seat and continued to wait without questioning. I didn't want anything to happen to our beloved deep dish pizza!\n\nAnyway, aside from that, I like Black Thorn.

What is this, crackyard bowls?\n\nFirst, everyone inside the place looks like a yoga/pilates/some kind of healthy lifestyle type or surfers if they are dudes. Ugg boots, yoga pants, tank tops, ball caps. Slather on a little extra estrogen, because the primary clientele appears to be women. So guys, take note: might be a good place to meet women. \n\nThe options are bowls of acai yogurt base, or granola or oatmeal, or cups of smoothies. Everything's in the price range of about $6-7 for regular sizes, or $9 for large sizes.\n\nI ran into a friend who'd just sat down with this large bowl of stuff. It had the acai yogurt, granola, strawberries and bananas, goji berries, lots of fennel pollen bee pollen type stuff and the whole thing was drizzled with honey. It was the large bowl and it was massive.\n\nI got, I think, the berry bowl, which appears to be very similar to what my first friend had, minus the pollen bits. The friend I came there with got the island bowl, which looked like both of our bowls, but with shredded coconut on top.\n\nI have no doubt that the offerings are rich in anti-oxidants and the food provided is very nutritious. But I do wonder if people are so overwhelmed by the idea of so much Good Stuff that they ignore the fact that most of these items are still 700+ calories.  Are they eating this with the idea that nearly half their daily calorie intake's been covered? This is definitely a better 700+ calories than, say, a burger, but will it sate people's hunger for the same amount of time, or are they eating the bowl and then going out for the burger?  Hmm!\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the food, although it was a bit cool that morning and this definitely would have seemed more refreshing on a warmer day. I did feel cold after eating it. As a consumer of yogurt, fresh fruit, wheat germ and agave nectar, I felt I was already eating breakfasts like these, so perhaps it was not worth paying an additional $6 over eating it at home. But Backyard Bowls was terribly popular and crowded, so it's doing well, and this is a Santa Barbara originated company, which I wholly support. \nFor those who can't put together a bowl of yogurt or oatmeal to save their lives, Backyard's here to help.

Being home only 6 days a month gives me a limited sushi schedule  and makes me not so adventurous when I actually can have sushi.

I know you didn't ask, but I am still gonna tell you.  We chose Minato because I recognized one of their chefs on their facebook page.

We were seated in an efficient and friendly way.  Drinks were ordered with a frustrated sigh.  Coke products.  Bleh.  Don't let the Pepsi cooler fool you, they serve Coke products.  Mussels and pot stickers were ordered to be sampled.  Both were good.  Very similar to many places in town.  We then ordered up a few rolls (Minato roll, Volcano Roll, and one similar to the golden gate and had a name like splendor roll)  We also ordered up a couple hand rolls and the chefs were putting up stuff for us to try out.  The one rough spot here was the nigiri.  The yellow tail was just a touch under what I like, and the other nigiri wasn't really notable.\n  The rolls were good, as was all of the special stuff that we that hadn't ordered.

His experience in the Reno food scene started in the 1980s. Working at various casinos and their respective steak houses, opening restaurants in Southern California for well known name brands, and being trained by world renowned chefs, he has developed the chops to run an efficient and successful restaurant.

But really it's no surprise that this place is so good when you consider one of his past posts was a stint at Western Village Steakhouse. \n\nA few notes.\nBeer and wine will be available by the end of the week and the liquor license is in the works and looks to be a few months out.", "date": "2016-03-07 22:16:33"}, {"_key": "32018", "_id": "reviews/32018", "_rev": "_fNyp7vq--X", "review_id": "Vinh3nZcajgCRLheXFp73g", "user_id": "03RJcIDcNwH4WQmqjIvwIw", "business_id": "j8JOZvfeHEfUWq3gEz6ABQ", "stars": 4, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "We came on a hot sorcerer of a day to avoid the heat.

A feeble attempt to counteract all of the bad food we ate while traveling.\n\nI signed up for a Sunday morning Spin/TRX class. When I pulled into the lot, I feared I might be the only one signed up because the lot was empty. Pro tip: the entrance is around back.\n\nThe studio is nice and bright, except for the spin room, which I've found to be the norm. Of the two parts of my class, I wasn't a big fan of the spin class. The bikes were nice, but I missed the monitors at the studios I attend back home; I like seeing RPM, watts and distance. The instructor was nice and provided cues and motivation, but didn't love the workout. We did a lot of arm moves and spend a lot of time at 3; I like more variety - more seated climbs, slow climbs at 3, interval sprints, etc. At the end of the sprint portion, I was sweaty, but not tired. I much preferred the TRX part and wish the whole fusion class was 90 minutes. The TRX portion felt short, probably because we ate up some of the time switching rooms, changing shoes, etc. I know I'll be feeling my arms tomorrow after our TRX workout.\n\nOverall, I liked the studio. If I lived in the area, this would probably be my regular spot. I'd also probably forgo the combo classes and stick with a straight spin or TRX class.\n\nTIP: They do rent cycling shoes for a small fee. I wish that was in the Classpass description because I would've preferred it.", "date": "2017-10-04 02:05:18"}, {"_key": "103467", "_id": "reviews/103467", "_rev": "_fNyp7Hm--E", "review_id": "NfJS_VgosPAEARGilYu5SQ", "user_id": "qjfMBIZpQT9DDtw_BWCopQ", "business_id": "j9Kaj_6tSeXmVMYCgZithg", "stars": 2, "useful": 15, "funny": 6, "cool": 9, "text": "Epic Fail, yes I said it. I've been very eager to come here for some time. The waits have been about 50 minutes to an hour. Seriously, come on people. Is it that amazing? I think not.\n\nI finally found a reservation on Open Seat, and said okay I'll give it a shot now. We were sat in the very corner seat for two. I wasn't happy with that, but another wait would have been a half hour, so no thank you. I'll stick with the seat I have, and it was probably better than the other seats.\n\nThis location is small. You either sit community style in the middle or 2 or 4 seat tables close to the bathroom and kitchen, or tables by the front by the windows which are better, or outside which would be the best once it's nice outside!  \n\nIf you want to come here so you can feel like sardines in a tin can or pigs in a blanket, this will be your place. Don't come here for a date night. It's not intimate and comfortable whatsoever.\n\nOn to the drinks and food, what made me most happy was my frozen creamsicle served with whip cream. It was yummy, but could it have been filled at least 3/4 of the glass instead of a half for $9 for this glass.\n\nWe ordered the potato gnocchi for an appetizer. This was more cream than anything and the pork belly type pieces were very tough. \n\nWe ordered off the specials menu for our main course. The Brick Steak and the Grouper Chimichurri was what we picked.  \n\nThe Brick Steak was very good and the flavor was sweet and savory. The potatoes were not very crunchy which would have been really good if they were.\n\nMy Grouper chimichurri was terrible. Why did they call it chimichurri? It was not that at all. Honestly this entree was like a Kentucky Fried Chicken Bowl with mashed potatoes on the bottom mixed with corn and beans(succotash) all of it was mixed together so the mashed potatoes were lumpy and not appealing. The Grouper, I tried to find the flavor in each bite, but could not find it, and also why oh why should watermelon be mixed with mashed potatoes. Don't touch this entree with a ten foot pole. It's $24 which is three times the price probably of a KFC bowl. Not happy. I tried to think the flavor would get better and I would grow into this, but it did not. It was not appealing and not what I thought it would be. Extremely disappointing.\n\nThe food here is overpriced and the fact that you are packed in as sardines and having sub par not flavorful food, it's definitely not worth it.  I'll pay the price for flavorful and extraordinary.
