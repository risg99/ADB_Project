But then a miracle happened and a larger booth opened up. We already gotten out food but the waitress was really nice and let us move since it was still in her zone. No biggie. But then the service was not up to par. She only bought us one set of silverware. I figured she just put the one down to go and get 5 more. Nope. So we had to ask for plates and more silverware. She brings us the other half of our order and says she'll come back with the plates and silverware. Brings me my drink. By this time we almost done eating. No napkins. Ended up stealing a batch from the bar. No silverware. No plates. Finally she brings plates and silverware. But she only bought 4 silverware sets/napkins and 5 plates. We have a party of 6. You do the math. Then she disappears for the rest of our meal. We don't see her again. We ended up having to hunt her down to ask for our check. Also note that before all this we were almost given someone else's order. The people delivering it totally looked lost. \n\nThis place is still running around with its head cut off. I noticed that there is an entire area in the back that they closed. Then you have people hoarding tables while their brats run around to play games. If they are not actively order a continuous food/drink I think they are done. Maybe give em a hint by giving them the check. Just saying. \n\nAlso, if you parked in the garage they only have pay Stations on the first and 6th Floor. That's makes a whole lotta sense. People can either go down to the first floor pay for parking and then go back upstairs to whatever floor they parked on. That's not enough elevators for all that foot traffic.

The steak medallions were slightly over cooked and the bacon was tasty.  I love the added spinach with my pasta topped with fried spinach.  I miss the blackened chicken pasta! For dessert, we had the Bookie. \n\nMy husband said his ribs were tough to eat and the buffalo wings were too salty.  It's as if the buffalo wings just came out of the oven.  They use bottled ranch instead of making their own.  The fries were soggy as well.  \n\nThe Bookie tower for dessert was ok.  They did break the tower down so we can share.  One brownie/cookie topped with a bluebell vanilla scoop of ice cream. You can tell that they had just microwaved a frozen Bookie.

Those were great and came in very handy the first night when I was craving a late-night snack and the following morning when I did not get the chance to get breakfast and simply had a cookie, along with coffee that I could make in the room.\n2. While Wi-fi wasn't provided for free to everyone, the bar was set fairly low. All you had to do was to provide your Hilton Rewards number and you could have access to wi-fi for free. While this means that people who haven't signed up have to do so to get the free wifi, it is still infinitely better than having to pay $11.99 or however much it is that Sheraton or Marriott wants to charge me when I spend one night at their hotels.\n\nHere are some things that were not so great about the place:\n1. The poor quality of the sound-proofing: I was on the 23rd floor of the hotel and yet the road noise from below was enough to bother me on two of the nights that I stayed at the hotel. That is one of my biggest peeves about hotels - if they invest in sound proofing their rooms, they can help their guests get a better night's sleep but some choose not to invest in that consciously. I have stayed at hotels on the Las Vegas strip where in spite of all the ruckus going on below, the rooms themselves were practically noise-free.\n2. The quality of the food: Overall, very unimpressive. We had two lunches at the conference catered by the hotel and they were not inspiring. One of the lunches was better than the other but in general, they were not great. On the last day of the conference, I also ordered room service and again, I was not happy with the taste of the food. I had sausages that were overcooked to the point of being burnt; the scrambled eggs I had were not fluffy or well-seasoned - all in all, not the kind of food that makes you either happy or excited.\nI stayed here for the sole reason that the conference was happening here.

My father was so delighted. We shared a large basket of fries. He had the eggplant parm with GF pasta and enjoyed every bit of it. Service is always great.

Later she said it was jalape\u00f1o. I'm can't have anything spicy due to an ulcer. I told the waitress why don't you tell people it has jalape\u00f1o in it? She did say anything.             So we order and I had the smoked chicken and pineapple. At that time I asked for more water and my daughter asked for ranch. A few minutes later our food arrived everyone but mine. The waitress said it would be only a few minutes. So everyone started eating. 10 minutes later I man came over and apologize for my dinner said they had some problems in the kitchen and it would be a few minutes. So about 5-7 minutes my chicken arrived. Now my family was mostly done eating. I looked at my plate and it's small chicken peace's with chunks of pineapple. Not much chicken. The bbq sauce was lightly poured on to it. So I tried it and no smoke flavor and it was very dry. I was expecting a little more the that.  The waitress forgot our water and ranch dip we had to ask several times. No apology or compensation for the spicy guacamole or dinner issue.

But my complaint I have with this particular location is their process for seating. There's no clear, distinct sign that says where to put your name on the list. We waited for a while before being told by the hostess seating people that you had to visit the counter to be added to the waiting list. There's a young girl with a tablet in front of her just standing there not paying attention to anyone who walks in the door. If it's your first time visiting this establishment you'd be totally confused. They should definitely have a better system. She eventually took our name down and said it would be 30-35 minutes for 2 people. That's interesting because the bar counter had plenty of empty spaces. We waited for about 10 minutes and we still ended up being seated at the counter which was previously empty when we put our name on the list. Not sure what time frame the hostess was on but she was clearly confused but don't know why it took us even that long to be seated when there was seating available immediately.

As I look at the picture above and refresh my memory of the plate the look of the nachos is very eye appealing as the tomatoes have a fresh and vibrant red color and the placement of the fresh jalapenos really jumps out too.\n\nNachos are a tough dish to review because there's two main trains of thought on the cheese. One train says to use runny nacho cheese and pour it over all the chips and stuff. The second train says to use shredded cheese and melt it at the end. I tend to lean more towards the first train when it comes to nachos...nacho cheese that's gooey and sticky and that unique after taste that nacho cheese has over cheddar, mozzarella, or colby jack cheese. So putting my \"preference\" aside on how I like my nachos, the overall flavor profile of this plate is quite astonishing. The pulled pork topping is definitely a bonus, but the nachos by themselves without the pulled pork are still worth a taste. If you get a little bit of everything on a chip then it will EXPLODE your taste buds. The veggies are crisp, the chip is crunchy, you do taste the cheese, the black beans add a really good texture and a bit of a salty salivating left hook of flavor. Depending on if you have the jalapenos in the middle, bottom or top will determine when the heat and bite of the jalepeno come in but it's a great accent flavor to the bite. The pulled pork was more sweet than tangy for pulled pork which was a good compliment to the bite and heat of the jalapeno. The sides of guacamole, pico de galo, and sour cream are available if you'd like but it will make for a very messy chip if you try to get all three of those on top of what already usually comes on a chip.\n\nThe only \"negative\" I could come up with is a challenge that every order of nachos has...getting cheese on every chip. The chips on the bottom middle of the plate are always bare by the time I get to them. The struggle is real for the nachos out there...all the chips just aren't getting treated fairly. The ones on top get everything...but those on the bottom get nearly nothing besides the scraps the chips on top leave for them.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nOverall...the Upland Nachos at Upland Brewing Company Carmel Tap House are great for an individual or sharing with friends. Pair it with a nice craft beer of your choice and you've got great food, great drinks, great friends, and a great time!", "date": "2017-12-05 19:26:29"}, {"_key": "115584", "_id": "reviews/115584", "_rev": "_fNyp7YG--_", "review_id": "OLP-wz-LVxWofN2NCQ8aCQ", "user_id": "Re3MArW_lrEBVCV-aDLizA", "business_id": "EbBQI254WN0AoH-y21-gCA", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Fun place with a great vibe.

My mom loved her \"Bee Charmer\" cocktail with lavender-infused gin, honey, and a few other ingredients. She liked it so much she asked the bartender for the recipe but the key ingredient, the gin, takes two days to soak in lavender before it's drained and ready to be used. \n\nThey have a decent beer selection but nothing particularly impressive. They have a few local brews from the area but this place is definitely known for its inventive cocktails.\n\nWe'll be back to try their famous burger but our appetizers of fried pickles (thick but crisp and fresh) and an adult version of pigs in blanket were tasty and worth ordering again although I liked the pickles more.

I had told him I was on a budget, & wanted to stay under a certain price, preferably.

After a period of time the manager (from the cooking area) had to yell out to an employee that there were people up front that needed their orders taken. I then heard the manager say \"I'm not yelling at you\" to the person. After placing the order, the counter person handed my wife a number to be placed at the table for food delivery. The card with the number on it was covered in some sort of sauce or ketchup. (At least clean it first) We then went to the serve yourself soda and ketchup machine. The ketchup was empty and the soda machine nozzle must have been dirty as it sprayed inside and outside of the cup. Was there a napkin nearby to clean up? No, those containers were empty too.

This entry covers two reviews: one is for a dinner and the other is for a breakfast.\n\nOn the 7th of December we did not get enough of the local food on our first dinner round so we decided to indulge in some more. After looking at the menu we could not really see many choices that are considered local or, at least, at a decent price (most of the stuff is on the pricey side). As I considered my options I eventually identified a few and I decided I was going to eat some fish so I ordered a black drum for $24 (not specifically listed on the menu because it's the catch of the day and it was disguised as \"Louisiana Gulf fish\"). As a drink I ordered an iced tea, nothing that deserves paragraphs or standing ovations so I will not digress on that. The seafood arrived a reasonable time later. It consisted of stacked slices of fish on top of some dark beans pointing towards the center of a plate with a buttery sauce drizzle. The dish itself was good and enjoyable. It had a bold but sophisticated flavor that you find in fine restaurants. From what I tasted it seemed to me the cook knew what he/she is doing.\n\nOn the morning of the 8th of December we woke up early and we decided to have breakfast at the restaurant. The weather was horrible (cold and rain) so we decided to start the day in a relaxed way. We arrived early in the morning (0700-0730), a great time to have breakfast because I like quiet places and the place was quiet. We ordered Belgian waffles (spelled Belgiam in the menu in the room). Since I don't like butter in/on most stuff, particularly on waffles, I asked not to put butter on the waffles. After 20 minutes our food was not yet available. Considering the fact the restaurant was deserted and we showed up rather early, I came to the conclusion they must have went to Belgium to get the waffles. After a while I looked over and I read the mannerism of our waitress. The entire thing translated into \"he does not want butter and there is butter on these waffles\" which in turn translated into \"you gotta do them again lady cook\" so in the end I believe we waited about 30 minutes before eating. When the waffles arrived (presumably from Belgium) they landed on our table and they had a nice appearance. The syrup that came with them was sweet and tasty. It wasn't the regular cheap waffle syrup you find at IHOP or Denny's. It had a higher quality, it was pure cane syrup and I could taste the difference. The waffles were good but they eventually got chewy after a while. Still, they were good, a little pricey ($12) but nonetheless a good way to start a day.\n\nThe service at night was good so I cannot complain about that. Our waiter was patient although somewhat unprepared in terms of mannerism and the way you would talk to customers, almost as if shy or on the first day at work. The service in the morning was mediocre. The lady serving us was a little stiff, disappeared for a long time.\nThe thing I liked the least about the restaurant was that the utensils were sitting directly on the table. For a place with a nice, relaxed and sophisticated ambient like the one in this restaurant forks and knives on the table a big minus in my book. Aside from the fact it's not elegant, it's not even clean. I wonder how this place can pass regular health inspections. Luckily, the manager on site at night understood the point when I asked for clean utensils and helped promptly. The person who served us in the morning paused when I asked for clean utensils (almost as if my request was totally unreasonable).\n\nI have one suggestion to the management which has two facets: train your personnel to be more friendly and relaxed and never take utensils back to the kitchen before bringing clean ones to the table (I am not sure to this day we got clean forks and knives at breakfast).\n\nI would give 4 stars to the place but the service can be improved and the utensils mustn't lay on the bare table so I can only award 3 stars.", "date": "2017-12-19 08:38:57"}, {"_key": "125333", "_id": "reviews/125333", "_rev": "_fNyp7l2--T", "review_id": "ACJ2d1It84sRiMweAQa5FA", "user_id": "J2tpajUShfcIx467_FQtrw", "business_id": "vLwlU-_WAZfC-6VIdIK12w", "stars": 3, "useful": 0, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "text": "The people there are very friendly but I was not a fan of their pizza.

The bar is pretty cool, as it has two peninsulas that jut out, enabling a group to sit and face each other, as opposed to down a line at the bar.  Service for that could be quite annoying, as it requires the bartenders/servers to either slide the food/drinks down, or step around the bar and deliver it.  When you walk in, there's a broken jukebox directly in front of you, which I think is intentional.  The bar itself is a bit dark, but they have cool lightbulb lights hanging above the tables and bar.\n\nService was a bit slow, as it seemed there were only two people servicing the entire bar/restaurant at 11:30am, but it tripled by noon.  We sat at the bar, towards the end, and the bartended gave us menus and water.  Everyone we encountered with was pleasant, and they definitely seemed busy.\n\nThey have a fairly extensive beer list (draft and bottles), as well as breakfast drinks - I got a bloody mary and it was fine...nothing crazy and fairly standard.\n\nHudson Cakes - these were simple pancakes with a scrambled eggs and spinach mixture inside, and it was pretty good - the dish attacks your sweet and savory tastebuds, which is always nice.  There wasn't much to the actual dish, as the pancakes were pretty bland, but again, the simple sweet & savory profile of the dish made it tasty.\n\nVeggie Cuban - other Yelper mention this was good, but I thought it was too salty/tangy...the pickle and the dijon dressing definitely overpower the entire sandwich.  The portobello mushroom isn't a thick patty, it's actually quite the opposite - it's a small sliver that you can barely taste, and it was a bit stringy/chewy.  Personally, I'd stay away.\n\nI'm a sucker for biscuits and this one was completely undercooked and doughy...not a fan at all.\n\nOverall, I don't think I'd come back for brunch, but the service was nice and I'd come back to check out the beer list.

Having recently been to New Orleans, I can tell you the decor is very similar to the trendy & chic little restaurants in the French Quarter. I cannot wait till spring to enjoy the outside dining. \n\nMy dining partner and I started off sharing, a Lump Crab Cake, Blackened Shrimp and a Cornmeal Waffle. My favorite was the Blackened Shrimp that came with a Cucumber Ranch. I tried it, it was cool and refreshing, but I ate my shrimp without it. The spicy flavor, was reminiscent of the cajun seasoning I experienced in NOLA. My DP, favored the Crab Cake. It was topped with slices of grapefruit and avocado. Make sure you get a mixture of all three in every bite. It makes for an interesting combination on your palate. \n\nOur Cornmeal Waffle was a tad cold, so we sent it back. The second one was warm and served with a large scoop of soft whipped butter. I enjoyed the texture of the cornmeal and the taste, but would have preferred some other type of topping in addition to the butter. Perhaps, a little cup of syrup. After all, it is a waffle. \n\nWe went in different directions on our entrees so we could each sample each others. Being a fan of catfish, I choose the Crab Stuffed Missouri Catfish. It was served on a bed of poblano grits and topped with a garlic dressing. You can not go wrong with crab and catfish in the same dish. \nIt's amazing how the older I get, the more I am developing an appreciation for grits. These were some of the best I have had. \n\nThe DP went with the Shrimp and Grits. The shrimp were the same as the Blackened Shrimp we enjoyed as an appetizer. She liked them. They were hard to photograph in a dimly light bar, so trust us when we say they tasted better then they photographed. \n\nBeing a bar diner, I was highly impressed with the comfort and style of the barstools. The back was low, giving good back support and they had armrest for extra comfort. Only thing lacking at the bar was hooks underneath for ladies to secure their purses and outlets to allow social media junkies to keep charged up. \n\nNathan was a great bar host and mixologist. He's a transplant from Tulsa and is adjusting to new city very well. Stop by and welcome him to STL. \n\nWill I return? - I hang out in Lafayette Square - so, YES!\n\nWhen: December 28, 2017\nWhy: It's new, hot and trendy.

I've been here a couple of times before.  Free pie Wednesday is good.  There's just a lot of restaurant choices so I don't eat here often.  We happened to be here on all you can eat chicken tenders night.  I didn't know they had that.  Anyway, my wife, son and I all got the tenders.  My wife ordered the regular, my son got chipotle and I requested the Nashville hot.  My son loved the taste of the chipotle.  My Nashville hot was okay, I just didn't like how it was soaked in sauce.  It made the breading soggy.  I should have asked for it on the side, but I didn't expect it to be like that.  I prefer Nashville hot to be more of a seasoning in the breading and not a wet sauce poured over the tenders.  I ate most of it, but some was just too soggy so I scrapped off the breading and ate the meat.  If you like very hot then O'Charley's Nashville hot really won't satisfy you.  It was spicy and had some heat but not really hot.  If you're familiar with Buffalo Wild Wings the heat level of O'Charley's \"hot\" would be in the range of BWW's Caribbean jerk.  The all you can eat tenders meal is a great deal.  With all of their specials throughout the week, and great coupons they mail, O'Charley's is a really good deal.

Fish and chips looked like larger versions of fish nuggets and the lamb, although cooked well, was really underwhelming.

The food gets 5 stars, but service brings the overall rating down to a 3. A year ago I went in with my mom and we ordered a Greek salad for two. A waitress immediately interrupted my mother and I and asked us if we were sure we wanted the bigger salad because the two of us probably could not finish it. At first I was taken aback by such a comment as it is not the waitresses/waiters job to tell me what I should and should not order. However, it never happened before so I didn't make a big deal out of it. All was well, until I went back again with my mother yesterday. Like always, we ordered a Greek salad for two. I proceeded to continue with my order and as I was stating I wanted a chicken souvlaki, the waiter didn't even let me finish before he said well if you are going to order more food maybe you shouldn't get the bigger salad. It'll be too much for you two to finish. Okay, are you kidding me? Is this a rule in this place? A rule that says you need to tell customers how much food is enough? This isn't alcohol we're talking about, you can't cut me off of food. The salad is not even big when split between two people. It is disrespectful that the waiters and waitresses are even making suggestions like that. It is rude, and mind you I'm paying for a bigger salad rather than a small one. Larger bill=larger tip. Better service=better tip. Simple as that.

Fried pickles are one of my favorite appetizers in the world of appetizers and I have had many a fried pickle in my day. These were delicious! You can tell they were made in house with a deliciously seasoned batter. Go easy on the dipping sauce though...it's spicy!!\n\nI ordered the chicken fried chicken and it was delicious! So good. The mashed potatoes that came with it were a little spicy but still very tasty. The gravy that came on the chicken and potatoes was the best part of the entire meal. The only disappointing part of the meal were the green beans. I could tell they weren't fresh and my husband's meal came with fresh green beans. My only feedback would be to replace the green beans that come with this meal with fresh ones.\n\nMy husband had the smoked meatloaf and he loved it. It came with a mushroom gravy and he was in heaven.\n\nThe Pecan Skillet cake was highly recommended by our server and it did not disappoint. This was hands down the best dessert I have had in years. It was like a pecan pie with a cake with fresh ice cream in a cast iron skillet. It was amazing. It literally changed my life for the better and no other dessert will ever compare. I will continue to have dreams about that dessert until I have it again.\n\nWe will definitely be back next time we are in the area!

Below I will explain why I say that and how it came to be.  What I want everyone who reads this review to understand is a few simple strategies. 1) Know what you want before you go to a RV dealership; 2) Do your due diligence on choosing Make, Model, Options and the Fair Price you will pay; 3) Order the coach so you have time to sell your own if possible; 4) Don't be in a rush; 5) Have all your communication in writing and if something is missing, take responsibility that you did not prepare prior to your commitment.  \nAll the above is what I did.  Why, because I read every blog I can find on the subject, watch every YouTube\u2122 video I could and listen to folks who have been RVing for decades. Every single part of my requests to Tampa RV were fulfilled prior to me even setting foot in the dealership. My sales consultant, Stephen Weaver, communication with me consistently throughout the ordering process (three months).  Everyone from the General Manager to the PDI manager called me prior to delivery.  Even the dealer sent me an email after I took delivery.  \nFolks, every aspect of my sale to delivery exceeded my expectation.  Thanks to the entire staff of Tampa RV for working so closely with me.  My hopes are everyone does their research and preparation prior to even thinking about the purchase of an RV from any dealership.  Bravo to all involved.  See my addition comments below for more information.\nThis not my first purchase of an RV/Coach.  Prior to every transaction, I do a level of due diligence that most people can't or are simply not willing to do. In the past I have been asked to speak on the subject at national conventions, pod casts, YouTube\u2122 reviews including my own and my personal blog on the RV Industry.  My goal is to be a advocate for clients to have a seamless and transparent transition with most RV dealers in the United States. I am called the \"RV Advocate\".\nOn to my review. When I finally choose my brand (AirStream), model (Interstate Grand Tour) and option package (Tommy Bahama) it was time to choose my dealership.  Since I had purchased an AirStream Trailer prior, I had gone through this process before.  It seems my prior dealer did not communicate some critical facts to me on my potential new purchase, so we parted ways as friends. My money, so my choice. I knew every single Airstream dealer is a five-state radius.  I had visited most of them. I was referred to Tampa RV (A member of the RVone Group) by a trusted Airstream friend. Tampa RV's reviews were not stellar to say the least, but I studied them very closely.  It became clear to me the issues, not only with Tampa RV, all RV dealerships I dealt with was \"professional communication\" on both the client and the dealers side.  I created a process in writing to leave \"no stone un-turn\" and the result was OUTSTANDING.", "date": "2017-12-06 00:34:10"}, {"_key": "51878", "_id": "reviews/51878", "_rev": "_fNyp8UK--R", "review_id": "K6sPT1PqI9w__zuLVLj_3w", "user_id": "29K-usmZfVDeIaQ85EG54A", "business_id": "2D4xIM1ahHTQa6iV4m3p9Q", "stars": 3, "useful": 1, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "text": "Froyo, check\nSelf-serve, check\nComplimentary tasting, check\nTons of toppings, check\n\nAs far as froyo goes, Whirled Peace certainly hits many of the prerequisites, but it lacks some of the final pieces to hit a 4-5 star review.

It's got a lot of different areas to hang out; aside from two large seating areas on either side of the counter, there's an awesome courtyard right on the corner of Haddon and Redman Avenues and plenty of sidewalk seating out front for the warmer months. Not enough places in the suburbs have outside areas for hanging out, so these spots for people - and puppy - watching is much appreciated.\n\nTheir coffee's always been pretty good, and I think they keep switching up what beans they get. From what I can remember, I've seen Rival Brothers, Square One. They do pour overs, which I love, and they've got some more exotic things sometimes, like the Gibraltar (a variation on a cortado) and the \"Americola\", a fascinating mix of Mexican coke and a shot of espresso. To eat, there've got a variety of pastries like muffins and homemade pop tarts and quiches.\n\nAlso, it's worth noting that this is one of the only coffee places open on a late Sunday afternoon/early evening worth going. There're a lot of coffee places around here, but they all seem to close between 1 and 3PM. For years now, Jersey Java's open open til 6PM on Sundays, which I really appreciate.

She said \"WHAT\" I again repeated myself same question she immediately turned her back and threw my bag of food on the counter and said I can't believe he wants a discount.  That made me be not so kind in response...my wife spoke to the manager and then called the corporate office they were going to look into it.  Fast forward about a month later went inside same location hadn't went there for a long time because of the little jerk employee she strikes me as the type that would spit in your food... anyway went in there with regular clothes on not sure if she recognized me from the month ago anyway she said \"is there a reason you are looking at me?\"  Again my response was not to kind as I wasn't staring or giving her any reason to say anything to me.. She just in true HOODRAT format I guess called herself challenging me! The manager while seemingly a nice guy has ZERO control over this little young employee to the degree my assessment was I have to reach a higher level to speak on this.

Although the aforementioned person doesn't have the hair or tattoo issues the personality is indeed dysfunctional!! SO obviously they missed one!  Had to call Corporate again on the second incident they said they were sending someone to this location based upon second complaint on the same person! Again manager was a nice guy but lacked the control of the establishment! CHICK FIL A is not the cheap place to eat as such (fast food) u just expect a little better in the service department!

On both occasions we had the wine pairing and it was spot on perfect with the courses. We started both times with a palate teaser from the chef which promised the joys of what was to come. Unlike most multi course chef's offerings (such as Alinea in Chicago) Vetri actually gives you a choice of dishes within a limited range of beautifully prepared courses. We opted to have the chef choose for us both times so that we could taste what he thought was interesting and so that we could share each other's plates. When I say that this rivals the best restaurants that I've ever been to, it is not an exaggeration. The blend of flavors in each course and plate was magnificent.\nIn addition, we had the same wait person both times and he paid meticulous attention to us and was friendly and understated.

The crowd is here everything from families to college friends to tourists.\n\nFood: The place offers Missouri raised grass fed beef. So you know you're getting good stuff. If you're not into beef, their chicken burgers are also really good. I will say though their vegetarian patties aren't as flavorful. I have been to very few burger places that can do a good veggie patty. After all, this is a burger joint. We hope you didn't come here for veggie patty. We asked for ketchup and they had a house made version. I'll say, I'm not a fan of it. It tastes like puree than ketchup. The sauces on burgers could use some inspiration. They have the basics such as siracha, mayo, mustard, bbq... But if you really want to set your burger apart, step up your game on the sauce!\n\nDrinks: They have a pretty nice bar with TVs, if you're looking for a place to eat by yourself. With that said their spiked shakes are pretty awesome. If you haven't, you should try their normal shakes and ice cream too!\n\nService: It was pretty busy when we came here, yet the service was fast.

I had to pick clear and colored gel off my skin later and trim where it had pooled in cuticles with nail scissors. Several nails were filed slightly assymetrically. Also they do something called wrapping their tips with a extra layer so it's sealed under and looks kind bulbous on the nail, like thicker visibly and to the touch at the tips. \n\nThat being said the tech was super sweet and genuinely nice.

The ginger salad followed with slices of avocado and wonderfully balanced ginger dressing that wasn't too sweet.

The fish absolutely melted in your mouth and highlighted the night beautifully. The dragon roll was crafted wonderfully and the rice on every selection seemed to highlight the delicate subtleties of genuinely fresh fish. The wasabi was even a notch above.

I have been to Ava plenty of times but never wrote a review prior to now...it's time to spread the love! \n\nMy first experience at Ava was during Creative Loafing's Restaurant Week Tampa Bay in 2015. Since then I've been to Ava several times, mostly for dinner with family and friends and sometimes for lunch. I've also visited Ava to pick up food as an UberEats delivery person.  \n\nHaving visited Ava several times, I am certain about a few loves: \n\n1. The ambiance. It's perfect -- lively yet romantic; trendy yet comfortable. Ava offers al fresco dining (covered outdoor seating) as well as a variety of table styles inside (from classy high tops to traditional table seating). Be sure to ask about the \"Secret Dining Room\" if you're in need of a reservation for at least 10 guests! \n\n2. The Casarecce al Pomodoro. I love to order this dish with extra ricotta and sometimes, if I'm feeling frisky, with the Nduja sausage (this is a spicy sausage which is different from the fennel sausage). \n\n3. The Ava House Salad. It's a bit on the pricy side at $8.00, but the ingredients (mixed greens, cucumber, radish, tomato, red onion tossed in a house Italian vinaigrette) offer the perfect explosion of flavors pre-entree.\n\n4. Joe Maddon. He is part owner of Ava and he is former manager of the Tampa Bay Rays...so duh, he is a love.\n\nAlso, for solo diners, Ava is one restaurant that has an incredibly welcoming bar that erases all of the unnecessary shame in dining alone. Trust me, I've done it time and time again.  :)", "date": "2017-12-18 00:29:00"}, {"_key": "62289", "_id": "reviews/62289", "_rev": "_fNyp8mK--h", "review_id": "EAIO2nxIhQnp31Igh2aHSA", "user_id": "j0TcW7ZRqFQe5zMumdYlgQ", "business_id": "zFk38MOcCRPXf8Ul94vmSQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "why did you burn the building down that was my favorite pizza place.

It is strictly 3 hrs of bottom fishing for grey snapper, hogfish, sand perch, and many other fish that are not very big at the approximately 50 ft depth they fish at on these trips.  I went on 10 trips from December of 2017 through July of 2017, then quit going because I never saw a fish bigger than 6 lbs caught on any of the 10 trips. This 5 hr trip, in my opinion, is a good experience for tourists, and children, but not for serious fishermen.

Not only was the staff extremely welcoming and personable, but I loved everything about the concept. It literally pushes you to work harder and get in shape. I don't have the drive to do it on my own, so fortunately this was exactly what I needed. I've been coming for 3 months now and no workout has ever been the same. I love the energy when u walk inside. For people like me who have extremely hectic and inconsistent work schedules, this is perfect. All you do is download the app and you schedule according to what works best for you. They have classes all day at all different times. If your wondering about bringing headphones or making a playlist, don't bother. The instructors have the music bumping when u walk in. I haven't taken everyone's class, but Brandon, Jeff, and Josh's music selection definitely will have you in the zone. Everyone needs a little trap music in their life lol. If I haven't convinced you by now, then go in and see for yourself. They willingly will give u a walk through and let u do a trial class.

Given that this was close to where we were staying (the Marriott), it was easy to pop out and roll over to 21st Amendment, which was only a few minutes away. There wasn't a line outside, but it was packed by the time we made it inside (sometime between 10-11 PM)...standing-room only, with the seats at the high-top tables and the bar taken. The decor and ambiance is a bit more retro, but like all New Orleans spots in this fashion, it feels homey, and it was enhanced by the fact that the band in the bar playing live music was absolutely entrancing the audience, with some folks even doing some dancing right at the front.\n\nThat said, I did come here initially because it was rated highly for drinks, and on that front, the cocktails do not disappoint. The bartenders make the drinks expertly, whether you stay on-menu or stray off by giving some general preferences. The beer selection is more generic, with specific bottles being the big-label brands, and no names given for listings like 'seasonal' or 'IPA'. Nonetheless, the drinks are made quickly but consistently - something I appreciated given how busy it was that night. Pricing was reasonable, relatively speaking - $13 a cocktail is a bit expensive, but the quality was very good, making it a bargain compared to some places in New York that I have been to.\n\n21st Amendment really has a nice cozy feel to it, and with great drinks and great music, it's hard to go wrong. It doesn't have the kind of 'fun' you'd find half a block over on Bourbon Street, but at my age, it's the kind of fun that I'd rather have.

The crepe menu has about 8 options you can choose from sweet or savory concoctions. I ordered the fruit crepe that had blueberries, strawberries, bananas, and kiwi.

We'd been to Hibachi before so somewhat knew what to expect but went into it with no expectations.  We sat down with two other couples and immediately knew this was going to be a weird night.  The couple next to us told us that they were regulars and came roughly once/week so we leaned on them for guidance and expertise.  I ordered the Rocky's choice and my husband got the teriyaki steak - both were good but the problem was our experience.  Immediately my water was overfilled and the woman to the other side of the table made a huge deal about it and we knew that they were going to be persnickity and make all of the servers and chefs very flustered and because of that my husband and I just tried to smile, laugh and enjoy our date night and not pay attention to them.  They went on to correct the chef multiple times during his presentation, tell the servers that they were getting them the incorrect sauces, extra dressings, multiple waters and sodas even if they weren't finished with the ones that they had (people, i tried to tell you that this was the weirdest experience we've ever had).  With how shaken the staff was, our presentation was not the best and our food wasn't cooked properly because the chef had to cater to this couples ridiculous demands (more butter, cooked more, i want my vegetables and meat mixed together, cut my meat in the opposite direction).... and then the weirdest part was that the couple ordered an additional steak which when the server went through to ensure that our orders were accurate was never brought up but then when the couple didn't receive it at the end of the meal were OUTRAGED.  To the point where the manager came over and assured them and guaranteed that he put the steak on the plate himself (he didn't) and they called his bluff and everyone got even more uncomfortable.  phew.  Now they forgot my white rice as well as the entire table's ice cream and tea and gave us the incorrect check twice.  The bathroom floors were incredibly sticky and gross and two people at our table had to request new flatware or plates because they weren't cleaned properly.

I love multiple levels of their establishment, but the beer is not one of them. And let's face it, it's a brewery. Isn't that kind of important? \n\nLet's start with the heart eyes emoji provoking assets. Their food is great. Their fried chicken sandwich melts in your mouth (I didn't order this but I always get a taste of my buddies palate ). Their bao buns were not the best I've ever had, but still tasty. I actually prefer mine more on the airy, fluffy side, but they choose to sear theirs so it's a little crispy on the outside. I'd also prefer. More crisp than fatty piece of belly inside but hey look who's being contradictory now (make up ya mind, Tone). Anyways, I was surprised at how much I loved the fried rice in my salmon taco. I actually enjoyed a few forkfuls on its own throughout the course. But even still, almost all of the portions are a little small for the price. Quality is important though here, and I feel they nail it. \n\nThe atmosphere is definitely another pro. If you don't like noise, go away. People are having fun and drinking merrily. It's gonna be loud. So talk a little louder, look at your guests when they speak, and laugh at the kids next to you trying to steal their dad's wings. I'm Italian. I'm loud. I love noise. It makes me feel at home. So the tremendously open layout of this building is much preferred over their cafe location. \n\nSo the con here. Guys. Whyyy are your saisons sour? No where else do I experience this, and saisons are my favorites. And guess what.. I hate sours. Don't get me wrong, I've had a few of their beers that I have really enjoyed, but overall I think this place is over hyped. My thought is they just try to get too eccentric, and just get a little nutty with their concoctions. Like I said, I don't hate it, but I rarely love it. I'll still keep going though.

The tortillas was small, the bowl will be enough for you to get full for lunch. This spot would be ideal if you want to grab something on the go for lunch but you don't really care how good it taste. The steak itself is thinly cut and little or no seasoning on it. If you dine in they have complimentary tortilla chips but when I was there it wasn't refilled. It can get packed during lunch hours so if you're planning to dine in with more than four people, I suggest you come a bit early to grab some tables. Would I come back? Most likely not, I rather go elsewhere.", "date": "2017-12-03 02:27:10"}]
