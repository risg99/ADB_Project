I've been going here for almost 2 years and the staff is incredibly nice.  I've been a gym member since I was 16 - at Aquatic Fitness Center, LA Fitness, The Firm (of Marlton, NJ), and Planet Fitness.  In all my years, I've never been greeted by name with a high five and sometimes a conversation.  They've got my schedule down, they know when I'm coming in for the most part, they even know what I'm reading.  And not in a creepy way.  They know I love my spin classes and when I come in they hand me over the red class card immediately because they already know that's where I'm going.  They've even got my keys memorized!\n\nI utilized their fitness assessment when I first joined, and I got really worried that I was going to be pressured and ostracized until I bought a personal training package.  Not the case at all.  Tony was super helpful, and had a ton of information, and there was no beef at all when I didn't want to sign up.  He's still friendly, fixes my form if he sees me, and he too also comments on my reading ha.  \n\nSpinning Intructor Carl is another amazing staff member.  His classes are energetic, and even though it pisses me off that he'll call me by name to sprint (or call me out on not going fast enough) he challenges me to perform and that pays off.  He's inpsired me to get my own certification that I'm very excited to utilize.\n\nThe gym itself gets crowded after work hours, but the parking isn't terrible and there's street parking on Green.  Their hours are great, and they open at 5am during the week...meaning their desk people are there at 4, jeez.  Their equipment is up to date, there are tv's on every machine, they play uplifting music and football on the weekends on the gym TV's.  They have a juice bar with a 4square special, and there's tanning --something that I haven't taken advantage of.  They also have circuit training classes with a trainer at a decent rate, and there's member appreciation events every month.  I mean they REALLY appreciate their members...they give us alcohol!

I used to play lacrosse. (Sure, I rode the bench, but I still practiced like a winner.) I used to strength train with a former Romanian World Cup soccer player who looked eerily like John Travolta from Pulp Fiction on many, many steroids. (True story; 2006 was a weird year for me.) I used to eat right, drink plenty of water, and take all my essential vitamins. I was young, virile, and full of energy, ready to live a long and eventful life free of prescription medications.\n\nAnd then I discovered beer.\n\nYears of the sauce coupled with limited time for exercise (Damn you, soul-crushing job!) made me into a pretty average, pretty chunky little twenty-something. Recently, I decided to do something about it. \n\nI began researching the plethora of gyms scattered throughout our fair city, only to discover that waiting tables could never afford me any of them. I heard great things about some of the bigger chains (*cough* SWEAT *cough*) but I simply could not afford their monthly rates. Then an angel in the form of a buddy from work told me about an incredible deal in Northern Liberties. Given how much I missed being in shape, I had to check it out, and I did just that.\n\nI've been going 4 times a week ever since. \n\nNow, before we talk about the machines, the size of the place, or the classes, let's head off on another path. If you (yes, you) are a follower of my few reviews on here, you may have noticed a theme: I have a secret love for personality displayed in the staff of the spots I frequent. (If you noticed, gold star for you. If not, accept it as absolute truth and carry on reading.) Anyhow, the first thing you notice upon entering City Fitness is the staff. And this staff has definite personality. Everyone smiles. Everyone greets you. If they remember you from the day before, they let you know. If they saw you doing a weird exercise, they ask you about it. Here's the important part, kiddies: THEY MAKE YOU FEEL WELCOME. One of the biggest problems I've encountered in the gyms I've attended in the past has been a general feeling of indifference emanated by the workers. They didn't care whether or not I was there, and I was therefore usually too intimidated or put off to ask them for assistance. Often, this little indifference is what caused me to cancel my membership. Somehow, I don't foresee that happening at City Fitness.\n\nThe gym itself is huge. A converted warehouse, it has a little bit of everything. The main room consists of the weight section (combination of free weights, benches, and varying machines), the cardio section (50-something pieces of cardio equipment, each with their own LCD TV attached), a stretching/aerobic section (that could admittedly be bigger), and the smoothie bar, which boasts some of the best original recovery shakes I've ever had. They even create specialty recipes for the holidays! Trust me, you're sorry you missed the Thanksgiving Pumpkin Pie shake.\n\nAside from the main room, City Fitness also has dedicated spinning and yoga rooms, each adorned appropriately, as well as a multi-purpose room used for many of the classes offered.\n\nWait, did he just say classes? Yeah, he did. CF has a lot of them. They offer the traditional fare, like the aforementioned yoga and spinning, as well as some more cutting edge classes, like kettle bells and core-centric bridal bootcamps. (Not my cup o' tea, but hey) Different trainers handle different classes, each according to their own personal specialty, and from what I've seen, they kick your ass.\n\nNow, that last sentence implies that I don't actually take the classes offered. I don't, and the reason for that is because they cost extra money when added to your monthly membership. Ah, the catch... Actually, most things at CF add a few dollars to your membership fee to utilize fully. Classes, towel service, and locker rentals all increase your very reasonable starting fee and make it... still incredibly reasonable. Seriously, I've done the math, and even if I were to add the fee for taking classes to my membership, I'd be paying less than a basic membership at Sweat. That, friends, is superb.\n\nSo, if you've been following along, you've come to realize that City Fitness is a large, friendly wellness center with a little bit of everything for everyone that won't break the bank and is easy to get to. (It's literally 40 paces from the Spring Garden El stop.) The question is, with this information in hand, why the hell aren't you there yet? When you do go, look for me.

CityFitness sets you up with a one month trial membership. This is awesome because it's not just limited to the spin classes offered on the pass, and you can utilize the gym for any of the services available to a trial membership. \n\nMy experience with the trial membership was fairly frustrating. I have a gym in my building so all I really wanted to do was take spin classes. Recently CityFitness switched to an online class sign-up system. I'm sure it's convenient for members but it's not available for anyone with a trial membership. Trial members have to call up the front desk and request to be manually added to the class list. For both members and trial members, each class opens 24 hours in advance. \n\nThe sign-up process doesn't seem like a big problem, however I was a huge fan of the 6:30pm Monday spin class with Steve. CityFitness closes at 6PM on Sundays. By the time the gym reopened on Monday morning, the class was typically full.\n\nThis speaks very highly to this class and the instructor, Steve. I enjoyed every moment of each class I was able to attend. He is lively, enthusiastic, motivating, friendly, encouraging and just overall fantastic. When my husband and I first started, we took the beginner class where he took the time to teach us proper set-up and technique. Aside from being a great teacher, his music selection was killer. I could only imagine what a bad song set could do to a class, but his music selections were upbeat and perfect for spin. \n\nI wasn't thrilled with the spin studio itself. Throughout my experience I personally came across some faulty bikes, from pedal straps that wouldn't tighten to seats that wouldn't adjust. During one class, one classmate was spinning so hard that a pedal broke while he was on the bike. I'm not sure if/when it was fixed but that eliminated one spot in the class for however long it was out of commission. \n\nSo long story short: Steve rocked but based on the condition of the studio and the billing issues I've heard about, I will not be buying a membership to CityFitness.", "date": "2014-07-15 16:18:18"}, {"_key": "44341", "_id": "reviews/44341", "_rev": "_fNyp8HC--q", "review_id": "wLA7DqNkST9V-E_yHON_yQ", "user_id": "lqKdWZ8UbNXQYSdbEP-m7A", "business_id": "HsibLfc2XD7Gh7Hbd1WfJQ", "stars": 3, "useful": 4, "funny": 0, "cool": 3, "text": "This is uncharacteristic of me, but I think that reviewer Cali T may have given this place a bad shake with a few of her complaints...

As for managerial presence, no I don't see what I presume to be owners there frequently, but during staffer hours I have always been welcomed with a nice hello and wave- most people, I think, don't want much more when they are in their workout/zen mode.

They're group classes seem to be timed to be just after school starts so it is convenient\n- Staff seem to be flexible with your needs if within their restricted hours.\n- Entire JCC is enclosed so at least you know when your child is running outside, there is minimal traffic and no strangers wandering about\n- Your child's tuition covers the cost of gym membership for you and spouse\n\nCONS:\n- Lunches are supposed to be nut free AND meat free\n- Lots of school closures for both christian and jewish days off\n- Lots of random rules (ex. if your child is wearing a skirt on gym day, forget it. She will be sitting on the sidelines)\n- Classes are not anywhere close to racially diverse. AT ALL. \n- Restricted hours: for any household with two working adults, you will have to deal with a 9a to 3:30p day care schedule with an \"early care\" option starting at 8am. This is pretty unbelievable considering the car traffic around here. \n\n\nFOR THE GYM:\nPROS:\n- As above, the link with the daycare seems to be the best reason to use this place\n- Sauna (but it is co-ed)\n- Several group classes offered\n\nCONS:\n- Everything is outdated even though they apparently just renovated the bathrooms. \n- Kiddie pool is kind of a joke... it's just a shallow outdoor pool that is covered with a thin film of dead flies and leaves\n- No towel service\n- The place reminds me of a YMCA ... from the 1960s. \n\n\nOverall though, I'm still using this place primarily due to location convenience and the ease of working out. I don't require a lot in a gym other than just needing the machines to work so this is fine enough for me. But just beware of the many many drawbacks that come along with it.", "date": "2012-09-11 18:58:33"}, {"_key": "33233", "_id": "reviews/33233", "_rev": "_fNyp70O--D", "review_id": "QaEm2S0fW06j87vQD03XOg", "user_id": "NAKuM4L7Ei7RPhXFCGfLIA", "business_id": "6jomGWEI4ryImrWPguUQQQ", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This gym has everything you could want but it just feels like something is missing.

It is an incredible facility; it feels wrong to even just call it a \"gym.\" I've been enjoying it for a little over a month now, I was able to join because of a LivingSocial deal which reduced the normal monthly fee of $102 to $60 (and no initiation charge and a massage or personal training session, to boot!). This now stands as the best LivingSocial deal ever in the history of the universe and it shall never be surpassed. Fin. \n\nI find most gyms utilitarian. Some are nicer than others, some have more equipment or shorter wait times for machines or cleaner facilities, but generally the vibe is people are there to work out and you go in and get it done and go home. The atmosphere here is totally different. The whole place just seems designed to make you feel taken care of. On the first floor, there is a small cafe with very friendly staff, I like to stop there for a quick snack and some coffee after an early-morning workout. There are some armchairs in front of a flat-screen TV that's usually tuned to CNN, some longer tables where you could eat lunch, and a few smaller tables by the windows overlooking Broad Street that have a great view. I've been to other gyms that have juice bars/cafes, but this one just has a very pleasant, friendly vibe to it. \n\nThe locker rooms are great. They're never crowded, the lockers are big enough to fit whatever you've brought with you. They have absolutely every amenity you could want - for the showers, there are shower caps, razors, body wash, shampoo/conditioner, and shaving cream. The towels are fluffy and always plentiful. There are individual vanities stocked with deodorant, hairspray, body lotion, hairdryers (with diffusers!) and curling irons. Whatever you need, they have it here. I don't think I've showered at home since becoming a member. \n\nSince it's been approximately 1 million degrees throughout my membership, I've been using the pool rather than the other fitness facilities. It is absolutely lovely. It is occasionally crowded enough that I've had to share a lane, but everyone is very friendly about it. Only once have I ever had to actually wait for a lane, and that was literally for five minutes. After my swims, I like to indulge in a soak in the giant hot tub, which is the size of my living room at home. I am not kidding. There is also a sauna. The hot tubs and saunas are single-sex, while the pool is co-ed. I'm a fan of the setup. \n\nAs others have mentioned, if the Sporting Club has an achilles heel, it is the price. I believe the normal initiation fee is $450, on top of the $102 monthly membership fee. They were recently running a promotion for a $99 initiation fee, but you're still looking at a considerable amount of outlay for a gym membership. If you can find a way to fit it into your budget, it would absolutely be worth it.

I might be biased but I speak only the truth. \n\nI have been a member for at least 5 years, maybe even longer and I have never had one bad day nor have I had to fight for space. SouthRac has definitely done a lot of improvements in their facility and every year they get better and better. \n\nSouthRac has other businesses inside its facility, so depending on what you're looking for, this place can be a one-stop-shop for wellness and fitness. There is a salon, acupuncturist, massage therapist, metabolic testing center and much more.\n\nI typically come in during lunch hour M-F since I work around the area, but lately I've been coming in around 2pm to stay away from the \"resolutioners crowd.\" Don't get me wrong, this place is HUGE that it never really feels \"busy\" in there. But I do enjoy the quieter time of the day. Cardio machines are located upstairs which overlooks 2 basketball courts, an indoor track, 2 racquetball courts, circuit weight training machines, open astroturf and the recently added incline ramp -- Shaun T would say \"Amazeballs\" to this. Strength training machines, heavy weights are mostly upstairs and the Group Ex room as well. They have great Group Ex classes with great instructors. If you ever want to try Zumba, take Dulce or Veronica's class because you will be hooked. Just last year, they also became a Les Mills gym that now offers various Les Mills classes. My favorite area would be the \"Bat Cave\". I do a lot of functional training and the Bat Cave is the best place to do this. The Bat Cave is covered with rubber floors which is great for plyometric exercises. In the Bat Cave you'll find battle ropes, rowing machines (another favorite), spin bikes, suspension training equipments, pull-up bars, lifting platforms, GHDs and also free weights. There are numerous plyo boxes, and even agility ladders that is accessible to all the members. I also appreciate that there are plenty of foam rollers for the members to use. In short, whatever it is that you like to do when working out, SouthRac has it. So really, you wouldn't have any excuse as to why you are not working out here.\n\nStaff is very friendly, always greets you with your first name which I think is very personable and inviting. Locker rooms are well maintained with multiple shower stalls. You will also find a sauna in the locker rooms. I have never used the saunas so I couldn't tell you much about these.\n\nParking can be hard depending on the time of day you come so plan accordingly.  Or just think about it this way -- you're getting in your warm-up walking from your car to the entrance.\n\nAs you can tell, I have nothing but great things to say about this place.

I love this place. It might not be right for everyone, but I'll note down what keeps me a regular and extremely happy member:\n\n-You can virtually always get on whatever equipment you wish to use, even during primetime hours. The parking lot may appear at times to be overrun, but a lot of those people are present for leagues, so don't let it scare you that the rest of the gym is overcrowded and you'll be sitting around, waiting for things to open up.\n\n-I work out all the time during the boot camp classes. Sometimes I even work out in the same space they use downstairs. I've never had any problems. I used to be a trainer for many years and don't feel these guys overstep their bounds at all. I don't think they monopolize the track for long periods of time either.\n\n-The customer service of the owners and staff is fantastic. In 3 years, I've never witnessed any bad behavior on their part personally. Karl and Gabe always know you by name. They talk with members and get to know them. The few complaints or problems I've had (minimal) have been met with quick and friendly response. The only staff member I felt had a problem with good service was their billing/accounting person. I talked to the GM and he took care of it within hours. Fantastic! Their front desk staff is trained to greet you, say goodbye when you leave, smile, and be friendly. Big points in my book. \n\n-If you are into functional training, this place is full of all the cutting edge equipment and the necessary space to use it. The indoor track rocks too. If you prefer traditional stuff, they have all that as well.\n\n-Their operating hours seem quite reasonable to me. Gyms are not going to stay open til midnight if the traffic they receive doesn't drive it. If you need to work out after 10pm or before 5am, another gym would be a better option for you.\n\n-Most of their long term, regular trainers seem well educated and up-to-date and good at what they do (as I have a degree in the field and worked in the business for a long time, I know how to rate what I see). I've never seen any of the men leer or sexually harass ANYONE (per another review here).

But if you go to other Planet Fitness in the USA, it is free. Also with this membership you get to take a friend for FREE...the visitor as total access to all of the equipment with you. Also, with this membership you get full access to the RELAXATION area, which is the tanning beds, the hydromassage tables and the massage chairs. \n\n If you bring a your own lock, you can also use one of the many lockers in the locker room. I love  the locker room area. It is large, with showers, plug ins for blow dryers, great large mirrors, and normal bathroom needs. \n\nThe equipment is amazing !! There are rows and rows of treadmills, elliptical machines, stationary bicycles, tons of different weight machines to work different sections of your body. Each machine has photo description on how to use the piece of equipment or you can have someone help you out and show you, NO ADDITIONAL COST..you can also get a personal trainer for FREE as well that will work out a work out regiment for you to follow if you are trying to reach certain goals. Right now !! ME !!! I am just trying to build up a better Cardio routine and burn some fat and loose some weight.. Wish me Luck!!! \n\nIf you are looking for a change and a New Gym...check out Planet Fitness!!!", "date": "2015-01-04 13:47:34"}, {"_key": "80538", "_id": "reviews/80538", "_rev": "_fNyp9Jq--K", "review_id": "2JRYmBECaKTxDkEfR9zgrg", "user_id": "Ot6Cd59xpz4H4IpNtqMp5A", "business_id": "vPlhhf6CcB5dzQv1sEwlvg", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Nice gym with friendly staff, but some equipment and lockers def showed signs of wear.", "date": "2017-07-29 01:59:51"}, {"_key": "105742", "_id": "reviews/105742", "_rev": "_fNyp7Ki--d", "review_id": "rOVUX25JpJ2XTumh2kfyIQ", "user_id": "N7IJIk9GNSqhoGW-QFNOYg", "business_id": "qNiZVduTtw3d1zGjHSM9zg", "stars": 3, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Greta, Louisiana ---\n\nA day at Planet Fitness doing a partial pARTy Fitness session ...\n\nThe \"Greta\" location is ok ... plumbing maintenance would get 1 useless shower working ... \n\nI am still a fan of Planet Fitness ... it works for \"Run-A-Way Bill\" \n\nday 035 \"DUSA 2017\" (Discover USA) \n\n\"Run-A-Way Bill\" was here! \n\n#RunAwayBill #PlanetFitness #DUSA2017 \n\n03.29.17", "date": "2017-03-29 18:14:08"}, {"_key": "112929", "_id": "reviews/112929", "_rev": "_fNyp7Uu--O", "review_id": "oyHM7fNGmuAE-0gdKgVsaQ", "user_id": "14G3cOMnyawTTUBcRJxw9Q", "business_id": "qNiZVduTtw3d1zGjHSM9zg", "stars": 2, "useful": 3, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "text": "No judgement free circuit zones for me.  I have a FREE gym membership with my job, but a one hour trip to the gym, turns into 2 because I have to wait for machines... Spent two weeks in the Charlotte area and was a guest of a member at the area locations.  I fell in love with the order and convenience of the 30/12 minute circuit program and the customer service.  Returned to New Orleans and joined...  Service- 2-3 ppl behind the counter looking down.  Circuit- 30/12 minute areas used as personal gym, when I attempt to get to the next station (in order), the other members get irritated or will not move, they will not wipe down machine because they are annoyed. The time I spend walking to the counter for the staff/manager to say, our policy is... (NOT OUR PROBLEM), we have to stay at the counter... is using up my gym time.  Then they share that everyone complains about it... and another member curses out members who do not move (put him on the payroll and I will schedule time with him!).  There is a white board that states a policy, they CHOOSE not to enforce. I even started attempting to find you a solution; guess what you have camera's in those areas????  You can monitor from the counter. I joined because of the 24 hr circuit availability and the service I received in Charlotte. One FB post, 3 conversations with staff and 2 suggestion box submissions later, I had to cancel my membership.  I guess you have enough members.  What really annoys me is, I recommended PF circuits to about 50 ppl when I returned... I am so embarrassed.  If everyone says the program is broken, get rid of it; continuing to market something you cannot manage is false advertising.  Throw out the red/green light and white board that says you will ask someone to leave or cancel their membership.  I really do cancelling my membership but I cannot to take my quality time to manage your members or program.

We love it; we both train almost daily.   \n\nThe instructors are world class (seriously, check them out),  the facilities are very clean, the training mat is huge and there is a competition-size boxing ring.  In addition, Paragon has a full range of exercise equipment, from heavy bags, Thai pads, gloves, and focus mitts to stationary bikes, free weights, and kettlebells.  \n\nTo me, the most impressive aspect of Paragon is the atmosphere and the quality of the instructors and instruction; professional yet very personal. The instructors are very supportive and take a personal interest in each individual student.   Not only are the instructors incredible, the fellow students are also fun, motivational and willing to help.   The workouts are disciplined and most of the students train quite seriously, but we also have a lot of fun.\n\nA couple of special notes:\nWOMEN: do not hesitate to try out kickboxing or JiuJitsu; there are many women at Paragon, especially in the kickboxing program\nTEENS and PARENTS OF TEENS: the atmosphere at Paragon is incredible; both the instructors and a majority of the students provide great role-models and support; you won't find a more positive environment anywhere\nOLDER ATHLETES: I started kickboxing more than two years ago at the age of 49 and, at my age, I worried about injuries.

Why not? Perhaps since I've started, I have never been this sore in my life, nor have I ever had any desire to jump rope until I pee my pants. Why yes? Crossfit at The Lab is FUN. The coaches and your fellow gym rats are PASSIONATE people.

Not here at The Lab. You go through a 3-class \"ramp-up\" to get you acquainted with the basics and to guide you through proper form so that you can be familiar with the basic movements before you venture into a regular class. The trainers are so knowledgeable and so invested in helping you achieve your potential - everything from correcting your form to staying late after class to answer your million and one questions. Everyone is kind. No one is judgmental. I have never felt so welcome to a gym, as a newcomer or not. \n\nIt's super inspiring to see people of all levels and expertise training alongside you. Not just because you happen to be a weenie and are benching only 43lbs (including the barbell lol) because it's only your first real-deal post-ramp up class. Ogling the people doing handstand pushups while you are struggling to finish your damn regular pushups is inspiring. At least it is to me.

I specifically pay $30 a month FOR PILATES AND YOGA CLASSES--so if the only evening classes offered within a 10-15 mile radius of where I work/live are always cancelled or rescheduled to Zumba or something high impact that hurts my joints it wastes my time and gas money in getting to the gym to find this out.\n\nBringing me to reason 1 of why this location in particular sucks: front desk staff are particularly rude and completely unknowledgeable.  So I asked to speak to a manager about the pilates class situation and got some guy \"specifically brought in to help that location.\"  He took down my info and offered to call me back with answers within 24 hours.  3 days later I call back and it's like we never even talked, he has no memory of offering to call me back and all he can tell me is that \"the activities person was in today working.\"  Great so does that mean she fixed the pilates class situation? \"I don't know\" was my response.    \n\nOn top of all that this location always appears dirty and dingy, the air conditioning in the room where classes are held does not work, and there's an infernal \"beeping\" all throughout the classes and all the instructors say they don't know how to make it stop (it's really distracting during something like yoga where otherwise the room is silent).  It's always crowded, hard to park, and the locker room is filthy compared to every other location.  Also I hate how all the machines are close together and stuffed into one level--it's just a very poorly designed space and it makes the chore of working out even less appealing.\n\nThis location is by far the worst of the 5 LA Fitnesses I've been to (including Montgomeryville, Fort Washington, Downingtown, and West Chester).

I could not be more happy with my experience thus far. At my first class, I met with the instructor, Laura, who spent time going over the ERG machine with me and showing me proper rowing form. She continued to check in with me throughout the class to see how I was doing and kept me motivated to keep pushing myself. \n\nWhile I have not taken classes from all of the instructors at RowZone, from my experience I can tell you that Laura is phenomenal. She structures her classes to be a mixture of rowing and strength training, with five 5-minute sets of rowing and a \"break\" of weight/resistance band training in between each set.\n\nIt's a tough workout, especially when Laura throws sprints into the mix, but that's why you're going, right? In one month I have lost 8 lbs and can notice considerably more muscle definition in my shoulders, arms and legs. In addition to great classes, the trainers are happy to share advice on other fitness topics from nutrition to exercises you can do at home. The online scheduler RowZone uses makes it easy to find classes that fit into your schedule, just be sure to be considerate and don't cancel at the last minute or fail to show up at all as there can sometimes be a wait list of other rowers who would like to get in the class.\n\nOne last point I'd like to make is the sense of community that RowZone fosters. While the quality of your workout is ultimately up to you, the support you receive from your peers is immensely valuable. When you feel like there's no way your legs can push you through those last 5 minutes of rowing, all you have to do is look to a neighbor for motivation to keep going.", "date": "2013-08-16 16:23:43"}, {"_key": "56698", "_id": "reviews/56698", "_rev": "_fNyp8bu--G", "review_id": "Y9CrF7h_TApVirU-nLH51Q", "user_id": "rqqpIgfNlwc-PzwcVdkctw", "business_id": "d9eI_GFFIvR22f63Jt1MtA", "stars": 3, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "The place is a smaller facility but I really get my workout in.\n\nDepending on which instructor it is, the circuit training may vary but the music always keeps me going as well as the variety in circuits. \n\nThey take walk-ins but I just sign up via Classpass.\n\nMake sure to bring $1 since towels are not complimentary.\n\nI try to work a RowZone class at least once a week. \n\nI highly suggest trying it out if you want to add variety to your workout regimen.\n\nPlus the music is a great variety that will keep you pumped especially for those who enjoy hip hop.", "date": "2015-07-05 03:04:09"}, {"_key": "57938", "_id": "reviews/57938", "_rev": "_fNyp8eC---", "review_id": "Rby08nExDcQMMUDUaVnkPw", "user_id": "X0CitA9E_kO4FwF3_mmFJQ", "business_id": "d9eI_GFFIvR22f63Jt1MtA", "stars": 1, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I was sort of unsure how to rate this place.

If you want closer to dark, sit in the back row along the back wall of the studio and not under the skylight or by the windows. \nThe spin bikes are ones I've used with a trainer but not in a studio before.

I find the rates reasonable and have been a member since they opened and will continue to be a member. So, for the rating I give the gym at CF a 3.5 star, I give MBSC a 1.5 star for an overall 2.5 star rating.\n\nMBSC review: I thought I would kick it up a notch so joined the MBSC thrive program at CF on South Street and tried it for three months. Trainers really aren't \"personal\" trainers. They have a set program that they put people through and you have very little to say about what you like/don't like. The trainers work with several people in a session so depending on how many people are in a session you could be waiting for the trainer to get back to you or waiting for the person in front of you to finish. One of the things that frustrated me is they want you to push through the routine they have come up for you in the hour's time. The sessions are hard with ropes, sleds, balls, bands, cables, weights and the most uncomfortable stationary bike I've ever had to sit on (and they make you end every session on the thing). No two sessions are alike - so if you like variety then great, if you like consistency or at least enough repetition to get the moves and form down then not so great. I seldom found a session to be fun or enjoyable, rather I often felt like I was a contestant on the Biggest Loser. They also play hip-hop all day long and you either like it or you don't. The environment and training is designed (in my opinion) to appeal to 20-30yo demographic.\n\nIf you really want to push yourself beyond your limits and don't care how you get there then you might really enjoy the MBSC program. If you want a professional personal trainer to spend quality time with you in achieving your goals and if you want a training program that you actually learn what muscle groups you are working and not just to be pushed through a routine then you probably won't like MBSC. Definitely do a introductory program because the usual 30 day notice from the contract date applies if you cancel and it's $200+/mo program.", "date": "2014-01-17 17:38:39"}, {"_key": "32289", "_id": "reviews/32289", "_rev": "_fNyp7w---t", "review_id": "GcnDUQFQ9bP3oONsfTtlXw", "user_id": "tGEkFShSLzO5BACDDBPb2Q", "business_id": "5kZtETKu37RuwHATrB4a5g", "stars": 3, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This gym is pretty decent.

This isn't always the case at other gyms which has always been confusing to me.\n \nMy only complaint about the gym would be the use of the space on the upper floor.  It looks like they could fit more equipment (weight machines or free weights) on this floor.  Additionally, one room has a really nice set of circuit equipment in it and suspension training equipment in it but it is always occupied by the \"We Fit\" class.  It's a great class and I am sure the members who take it regularly love it but the class is given at 5:30 pm and 6:30 pm eliminating that entire room and all of its equipment during the busiest hours of the gym.  It doesn't make much sense to me to dedicate that room during those busy hours to a very small percentage of members working out.  The equipment in that room would relieve the wait times and overflow in the free weight room and the only other weight circuit.\n \nOverall the gym does the trick and I can get a good workout in.

Maybe it's just me, but I think you should have to be in the gym ready for the class in order to sign up.  There have been times where I'm put on standby and can either wait the 15 minutes until the class starts to hope someone's a no-show or just go ahead and do my normal routine - I hate that.

Not sure how I could have known this since the voucher didn't say Sunday classes were excluded... The Groupon was expiring soon and so I really wanted to redeem the voucher, and they finally agreed to let me use it for that day. \n\nLast night I signed up and paid for zumba class this morning and dragged myself out of bed only to discover the class was cancelled because they have special workshops today.

I've mainly attended Peter's zumba class and love it! He is so upbeat and energetic - his class is a great way to start off my Saturday morning. I've also attended a class called Pound that uses special drumsticks, and it was a lot of fun. The prices are very reasonable as well.
