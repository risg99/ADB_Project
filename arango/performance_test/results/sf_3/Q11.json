The restaurant is located just outside the French Market on Frenchman St, in a lower-key, musically-influenced area of town.  I was looking forward to trying out their fried oyster po' boy, but unfortunately, the restaurant was out of oysters.  They use only Louisiana oysters and because of the oil spill in the Gulf, they cannot serve any dishes with oysters.  Boo.\n\nI subbed in a fish (catfish, I assume) po' boy instead and it was delectable.  It had catfish, shredded lettuce, slices of tomato, mayo, and pickles, inside a loaf of French bread.  With a side of fries, it was yummy and filling.\n\nSmall note on the fries: the menus have printed the fries are only $1.50 extra when ordered with a po' boy.  However, the restaurant charged us $2.00 and the server told us there was a sign out front that noted the change.  The menus still say $1.50 though.  The restaurant needs to correct this.  How are you just going to leave incorrect pricing in your menu (50 cents isn't a lot, but it's the principle)?\n\nWe were told by our waitress to try their fried chicken next time.  The waiters and waitresses are dressed in white dress shirts and black slacks with black top hats and suspenders.  The floor is tiled in black and white tiles.  The restaurant is connected to a small praline/candy shop where you can buy fresh daily-made pralines.  The pralines are about $2 apiece.

You'll even see several home owners just cozying up outside of their home or in their drive way around a metal fire pit and maybe roasting some marshmallows and have a warm beverage just watching all the revelers walking \"THEIR\" neighborhood. \n\nSo get on your walking shoes, definitely get the stroller or wagon for the little ones, cash for vendors and beverages, take photos, and enjoy the holiday season.", "date": "2013-12-31 05:46:49"}, {"_key": "117299", "_id": "reviews/117299", "_rev": "_fNyp7bi--M", "review_id": "Hi5qjx-w1cX52o-6oZUrKg", "user_id": "VcLRGCG_VbAo8MxOm76jzA", "business_id": "rsDFJ05TiW7yBMdVuQ2tQQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "It's the best.

Phillies are dedicated fans and it defiantly showed. They came out hours before the game and sat in the rain til it started. We watched the Phillies vs the Washington Nationals on Monday, May 21st. It was funny routing for the Nationals the day before. We arrived over two hours early and they had already opened up a limited section of the park. We got a drink at Harry The K's the restaurant in left field named after Hall of Fame broadcaster Harry Kalas. You can sit and watch the full game there as long as you keep buying. We watched the Phillies batting practice and walked around the park as it opened. We had seats on the very top level (4 levels!) and it was high up there, still a great seat...but almost a touch of vertigo. The whole stadium felt huge. Capacity 43,651, but it felt like 50+\n\nThe video board in left field was so clear and massive, apparently it's the largest HD screen in the National League.  It also wouldn't be Philly without a replica Liberty Bell.  It \"rings\" and lights up after Philly home runs and wins. Unfortunately, we didn't see either. The Nats won. Another Philadelphia quirk is that their bullpens are in the outfield amongst the fans. When they first opened in 2004 the Phillies bullpen was closest to the fans and after Philly fans booed their own pitchers (these are the same fans that booed Santa Claus) they switched to have the visitors section closer for heckling.\n\nThe mascot always needs mentioning. Its rates high on my husbands list. The Phillie  Phanatic....a green beakish creature. The Phanatic has been named the best mascot before and he did not disappoint. He was absolutely hilarious. He came out with a full rain suit on when it began to sprinkle. He mimicked and danced with middle school cheerleaders. There are also videos of him traveling to the Galapagos Islands...his birthplace.\n\nAll in all, the stadium might not have a beautiful backdrop of the city, but it was still a beautiful park.  Its very open and you can see the game the entire time you walk around the park.  There were so many options for food (love the cheesesteakes!) and the craft beer was endless.

Would I really have to wait two more weeks when I would find solace in East Texas?   \n\n\"We can try Burger up,\" I mentioned.  \n\n\"Why don't you just call them?\" hissed the appropriately nicknamed Viper.  \n\nTrue.  We didn't have to keep driving around aimlessly.  So I call Burger Up, and a very pleasant, sweet voice assures me they are indeed open.  \n\nViper: \"What was her name?  She sounded hot.\"\n  \nMe: \"Paige.\"\n\nViper: \"Yeah, she's definitely hot.  Have you ever met an unattractive Paige?\"\n\nMe: \"Good point.  At least we have that going for us.\"\n\nPaige was indeed attractive, but this review isn't about a photogenic individual who happens to work at Burger Up.  It's about what ended up being a visit to our fourth choice for burgers in Nashville.  \n\nBurger Up follows a national trend towards upscale burgers.  My particular order consisted of a medium rare patty served with aged cheddar, Benton's bacon (very good), and ketchup served on an artisan bun.  Basically, it was a gussied up bacon cheeseburger, but it was a rather tasty one.  My major complaint is that I wish the actual meat itself exhibited more flavor.  Having said that, the burger was cooked properly and the flavors worked well together.  I ordered some wilted spinach on the side (mediocre) and truffle fries.  Let's talk about those truffle fries for a bit.  I know more people are apparently into the sweet potato fries here, but I think they are missing the boat.  Burger Up's truffle tries have pleasant aroma, taste great, and are the perfect texture for soaking up oil.  If you are on a diet, it is true you should skip these delightful fries.  But if that were the case, why are you at a burger joint in the first place?  Seriously, if you get nothing else out of my review, please do yourself a favor and order the truffle fries.  \n\nBurger Up also boast an interesting beer menu with semi-obscure breweries from the Deep South included in the list.  I tried a pecan-infused amber from Mississippi - not bad.  I could imagine Burger Up could be a decent place to drink for a bit after eating.  \n\nIf I attended Vanderbilt, I would probably go here on a moderately frequent basis.

I look at the 50+ dresses that are in my closet, mainly from the 20s through the early 60s. It's discouraging to note that even though I don't really even wear them anymore, they are slowly but surely disintegrating (especially my 1920s and 30s numbers). What was once a fine silk frock is now reduced to spiderweb thread-bare on the seams, shoulders and anywhere there's the slightest bit of friction.

As a child, I'd cherish our annual trips to Mai Kai in Fort Lauderdale (which still exists, apparently!) Fun fact: About 5 years ago, I was a featured bartender in Inked Magazine where I talk about making Tiki drinks (you can see the photo in my profile), as I worked in a Tiki bar in NYC (Waikiki Wally's RIP).\n\nSo, yeah. I'm a lover all things Tiki, though I have to admit, I hate loathe and despise sweet drinks for obvious reasons, but hell, it's a Yelp review so I'll just come out and say it: usually sweet drinks mask cheap liquor. Usually sweet drinks are meant for people who aren't drinkers and can't stand the taste of alcohol. And last but certainly not least, sweet drinks mean for inevitable hangover. I pride myself on being a veteran drinker and at most, get one hangover a year. In fact, my year anniversary of my last hangover is coming up. July 4. \n\nThe fabulous thing is, Tiki Tolteca offers up *craft* Tiki drinks. Yes, you're reading that correctly. Look at my menu photos that detail the ingredients! They even offer up little stories with each drink. Their cocktails don't only feature rum, but such lovely spirits as my beloved Mezcal, and my much less beloved ca\u00e7aca. I settled on a Hemingway Daiquiri, which is frozen and perfect because it's not a fruit daiquiri, so not filled with artificial nonsense, just lime, rum, & maraschino liqueur. And potent, seeing as I was feeling a nice buzz after two.\n\nThey also have a menu feature small plates with a tropical flavor. DO NOT PASS UP THAT CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE DESSERT. The Tiki gods command it, too. Seriously. It really is the stuff of the gods. Chocolate, coconut, banana sauce... 'scuse me while I talk in tongues. I look forward to going back and trying the sweet corn tamales (vegetarian!). No crab rangoons, though, thankfully (created at Don the Beachcomber and now for some reason is expected on any given Chinese restaurant menu for some perplexing reason).\n\nOh!! Be sure and order a High Life, if you're so inclined, so you can get the full bottle service experience. This is no joke. They serve it in Champagne glasses and ice your bottle.

I've spend many an idyllic afternoon/evening here. I've also booked several of my colleagues at the Mazarin when they've come to New Orleans and heard good things from them (as recently as January 2015).\n\nSo when looking to book a hotel for a work conference 10 people I was leading, Hotel Mazarin was at the top of my list. And when you realize that in other local hotels you're probably going to get that New Orleans jenk known as \"charm\"  for a similar price, I will absolutely recommend Hotel Mazarin for being immaculate (with one tiny exception in my bathroom, but I'm insane), amenities (almost Westin-quality beds, flatscreen TVs), and the restrained modern baroque decor (gold fixtures, marble floors). If you're a breakfast-lover, you cannot beat that deluxe complimentary breakfast (eggs & bacon, pastry, toast, cereal, juices). Seriously, I've stayed in New Orleans hotels with TVs straight out of the 90s, ancient (as in, not antique) beds, dated decor and questionable levels of cleanliness. I won't name names (search my reviews if you must). But Hotel Mazarin boasts higher standards. \n\nThat said, my colleagues and I had some issues during our stay last month that should be noted. \n\n-multiple reports of the front desk/reception staff being aloof and often downright surly (unacceptable and so not typical of the superb hospitality that is the custom of New Orleans. I'm honestly scratching my head over this one). One of my people was reprimanded for putting a room card/key in her wallet when she came down to report that her keys weren't working (she never put it in her wallet but even if she had?!) When she explained that she had done no such thing, the response from the desk was an eye roll. Another colleague called the desk to report that his room was noisy. With a week of late nights and early mornings ahead of him, he thought he could request a quieter room. He was informed that he was in a quiet room. That's it. No apologies or explanations. I can write more, but in the interest of space, I leave it at these two instances. \n\nHowever, all of the other hotel staff were great, from management to catering (special props to the lovely Mary who took care of our conference room. She is a gem!) Everyone in the breakfast room and in catering were ALL so lovely and friendly (everyone says good morning and the catering manager walked around talking to everyone, making sure they were having a great stay). \n\n-the showers are extremely tricky to work and some of us didn't have anything hotter than lukewarm water. This is horrible to deal with first thing in the morning on one of the coldest weeks in New Orleans. I live here and I know the city's water pressure leaves a lot to be desired, especially in old French Quarter buildings, but this isn't OK in a hotel. Apparently there was some trick to get it to work and I can't even tell you what that is, because it's really *that* tricky. There should be instructions posted, unless this was a fluke with half of my colleagues' rooms. \n\n-catering: although the food is good, it's extremely overpriced for what you get. You are not allowed to bring in outside food, so if you're using their conference room you're going to have to use these services. I know this is common practice in hotel conference rooms, so although I won't fault them for this, next year I'll try and find an alternative.\n\nRelated to this: when setting up my catering order, I specified that three of my group had dietary restrictions/extreme food allergies. For the very expensive muffaletta sandwiches, I thought they'd at least offer a GF bread option for one or two of them for my G/F colleague, but no. Second, I was told the king cake would be nut free and it was not. Suddenly I saw one of my colleagues leaving the room in the middle of a session and I later learned that he had to go up to his room and take an emergency Benadryl. If he hadn't, he likely would have needed to go to the hospital, for his nut allergy is that extreme. If I put on my request that at least one dessert should be nut free and the only other dessert item is pralines, the cooks should pay attention and not put nuts on the king cake. Pretty simple. Attention to detail is crucial. Again, when you're paying extremely high prices for catering, high expectations should be met.\n\nI would still recommend Hotel Mazarin thanks to its amazing location for visitors to our city, as well as the nice perks, including two comped drinks at the fabulous 21st Amendment Bar.

The bisque was delicious: creamy and savory with a hint of fennel and perhaps truffle (I think?).  Anyhow, whatever the exact flavors were, they meshed well and made for a very good soup.

It also comes with a side of pecan butter, which was quite possibly the most delectable spread ever.  It was a nice change from the typical cinnamon butter and just so creamy with a perfect balance of pecan and the butter's inherent flavor.  It almost made me want to get another croissant just so I could finish it.  But then I would have been brought more butter and gluttony would have taken over.  So I desisted...with much restraint on my part.  Dad's BLT with pepper turkey bacon and aadditional semi-spicy fried egg was great and makes me want to add a fried egg to every BLT from now on; it's absolute ingenuity.

The skybridge network that connects almost every major hotel in downtown with the Convention Center and Circle Centre, eliminates the cold weather argument for many conventioneers.

Everyone else loved what they got too -- the snapper was apparently very good but had a strong coconut flavor, so watch out if that's not your thing (like me).

I have never been to Chicago so I can't say I've ever had the real thing. Part of the reason I've only had it a few times is because it's just not my thing. It's too heavy. Plus, I'm a die-hard NYC style pizza fan.\n\nSo earlier in the day I went to Bella Nashville and consumed their meat pizza with an egg. It's by far one of my favorite pizzas in Nashville. I did this not knowing that after my top dog's game we were going to 312 to watch the World Cup and eat more pizza. My friend said it best though, \"it's not pizza, it's a pizza casserole.\" Amen!\n\nWe ordered two deep dish pizzas, wings, and numerous drinks. The place wasn't packed but there was a good crowd. Our waiter forgot three of the drinks and to put the wing order in. He apologized profusely and comped the wings. He did everything he was supposed to so I'm not totally faulting him but you know, it was a hiccup. The pizza was good, my manbot says great, and the wings were just fine as well. I had a vanilla donkey (I think that was the name) to drink and it was fantastic. We also tried the weird shot that Chicagoans adore? and I will say, \"no, never, it just sat in my throat and I will never drink it again.\" I don't regret trying it though. I love regional drinks.\n\nOverall all this is what Germantown has been missing for quite some time. It's a place where you can come drink, or you can come eat. It's family friendly and sports friendly. The TV's are huge and viewable from anywhere. The room is clean, open, and well-lit. This also causes it to be loud. So be prepared. Overall, kudos to the space. I liked it a lot!\n\nI'll definitely be back, probably to try the arancini and mozzarella sticks. I hear they are HUGE! I'll also be back because I like the environment.

The waiter was super attentive. I ordered a glass of cab (clos de bois) which was fairly generously poured. The bread came pretty promptly and was freshly baked just for us. There was pumpernickel, min corn muffins, and one other rustic white bread. The breads were so good we ended up asking (or accept the offer) for a refill. \n\nThe kofta came out first and it was lovely! i didn't realize it would be kind of falafel-esque but i love falafels so that was no problem. The lentil cakes were fried and seasoned perfectly and the lentil curry was also very savory. Everything came together well, and we cleaned the plate (to which the waiter said he'll tell the chef how much we liked the dish). Then the soup and salad came. The soup was okay, not that surprising- tasted like lamb and barley. The kale salad was great. I loved being able to taste the fresh kale and not have the salad be overpowered by the creamy anchovy dressing. The crostinis seemed to be baked though and not fried, so the crunch wasn't as satisfying. \n\nAs for our entres, the zarzuela was cooked to perfection. The scallops had a nice char to them without being overcooked. Unfortunately, at this point I was too full to finish. The Moussaka (bf's dish) was also great.

I really loved the location of this hotel. It was walking distance to nearly everything Philly had to offer. We're pretty much in between the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Reading Terminal. So you can walk one direction towards the Museum  and go through Ben Franklin Parkway and through the Rodin Museum and near towards Eastern State Penitentiary or towards Reading Terminal which will lead you close to the Liberty Bell and other touristy sites.\n\nUpon arrival, we had the valet take our car. They offer a in and out service which was very convenient for us. It allowed us to take the car out at night and see some the sites and hit up Pat's Steaks. The checking in process here is a breeze. The concierge was really friendly and helpful. There were a few things I disliked about the hotel. One would have to be their elevators. They have 3 elevators but they were all so slow! My second was their bathroom. The toilet seat was loose and the sink counter and cabinet below was dirty. I had to wipe everything down with disinfectant wipes. Everything else was pretty spot on. The beds were a bit small but it was bearable. The rooftop pool was nothing luxurious but for what it is, it worked. It wasn't crowded, they had fresh towels on hand and plenty of seating. Beverages weren't allowed at the pool site. The views were pretty nice.\n\nVerdict - I would definitely come back to Windsor Suites if I were to visit Philly again in the future. I would just suggest to the management and housekeeping to make sure the toilet seats are on tight so that they don't wobble or break loose every time you sit down. And I hope in the future, the dust and dirt that was all over the sink cabinet would be gone. The value and price you pay is definitely worth it since you're getting a suite. Kitchen is kinda small, water and coffee are complimentary but I wouldn't recommend using their coffee machine. It is filthy! We ran water through it, and the hot water it produced was utterly disgusting! The closets were plentiful spacious. Our view was okay, 10th floor view of other high rise buildings. I wish we had a view of the other side that overlooks Ben Franklin Parkway. Everything about Windsor Suites gets an A except for their cleanliness.

The Wissahickon Valley Trail and Forbidden Drive meets that criteria.\n\nI was first introduced to this wonderful area when I had first moved to Philly and was teaching at a charter school in Nicetown. The school wisely took advantage of the trail. We would walk students there for field trips and enter at Lincoln Drive. Wissahickon Valley Trail is a wonderful place for youngsters to develop an appreciation of nature. The school would at minimum use it once in Fall and once in Spring and I would always look forward to those days.\n\nI have recently discovered another part of the trail, accessible at Northwestern Drive. That is where the Andorra Run meets the Wissahickon Creek. I took my high school class there for a lesson with the Wissahickon Environmental Center. Could there be a better place to learn about watersheds? For any fellow teachers reading this: the WEC is great, I highly recommend working with them.\n\nI now run on the trail from Northwestern Drive to the Valley Green Inn and back. That's 2.5 miles each way for a nice 5 mile loop. Along the way, you see the covered bridge, the only covered bridge still standing in a major American city and a few WPA built structures that are beautifully rustic. If only we could do stimulus today like we did in the 1930s!\n\nThere are a few historical markers along the way and the creek is gorgeous, especially at the dams. I love the sound of the water cascading down them. It is the perfect place to run: you are ensconced by the trees overhead and have a forest on one side, the Creek on the other. One drawback is that it tends to hold in humidity so it can stay very muddy in spots after rain. The surface is hard dirt, not concrete, much more forgiving on the knees. I really notice the difference when I finish my route and run for a second on the paved Northwestern Avenue.\n\nHaving run in Central Park and on Forbidden Drive, its not's not close.

Google showed me that it wasn't the contestant I'd been thinking of, but I was still curious enough to want to try the place. The wait was close to 45 minutes as estimated, and we eventually got a small table by the window. For lack of supply our table wasn't equipped with the same set of hot sauces as the neighboring tables. Margarita flavors of the day were strawberry or mango, and a pitcher of the latter pleasantly sloshed us by the end of dinner.\n\nI was sad to see that their menu online hadn't been updated with the recent changes. While I understand that it's a pain to keep stock for a vegetarian ingredient that isn't present in any other dishes, I'd been really looking forward to the cactus and sweet potato burrito. Which reminds me, I haven't seen a neighborhood so vegetarian-friendly in a long time. John was gung-ho about what appetizers we were going to get, so I let him take charge of those while I picked out our entrees. Given the amount of food we were about to indulge in, we opted to pass on the endless chips and salsa. As strongly as his roommate recommended the barbecue, I was pretty realistic about our consumption of food and chalked the pork belly off for a later visit.\n\nI've never seen fried pickle chips cut so thick (a hefty quarter-inch), and the texture was right on the border between cuke and pickle. The spicy chili mayo it came with was an okay pairing, nothing special. Of everything on our table it was the least spectacular, and as a result it was the only thing we left unfinished.\n\nThe single order of veggie wings with ranch sauce arrived at the same time as the other app. Celery and carrot sticks were acceptably fresh, though the celery was the lower quality of the two. The seitan was sliced thin and fried to crisps before tossed in buffalo wing sauce. An interesting plate that I was content to eat, but definitely takes an open-minded palate to appreciate. Not sure that I'd get this again, but I'd be tempted to make this at home if I went herbivore.\n\nSince the shrimp and chorizo burritos each came as a pair, we traded our spares to share the entree experience. The radish slices were nice to have, but I was unimpressed by the jicama cabbage slaw. I think my main criticism is that the tortillas tasted straight out of the package. I would've enjoyed each bite more had an attempt been made to lightly grill the wrappers. The chorizo was my favorite of the two; instead of pineapple, it's now served with roasted red potatoes that give it a fantastic rustic flavor. The wedge lime lightened the heaviness of the burrito, and I could totally picture this as an amazing breakfast burrito if scrambled egg were included. The shrimp burrito tasted of very fresh ingredients, but citrus wasn't present enough to make the seafood really pop. Sadly, this made the room-temperature tortilla overwhelm the light flavor of the shrimp.\n\nService was friendly enough to come by to top off our glasses for us despite the packed crowd and the pitcher being right there for our own dispensation. Two bathrooms behind the ATM/cigarette machines, surprisingly clean and tagged with random graffiti that actually fits right in with the feel of the place. The art on the windows made me smile, and the hubbub was too noisy for me to make out the TVs by the bar.

She chose the restaurant, having been there before, and chose the 8:30pm seating time for our party of 10. The restaurant is located off of South Street on this almost alley-like street, and the moment you walk in you grasp the concept they're trying to throw out at you: a traditional Moroccan-style meal in a setting that's supposed to mimic Moroccan interiors, with loud Middle Eastern style music (that sounded like the Slumdog Millionaire soundtrack). Rugs are everywhere, on the floor and wall, and you sit on low couches or cushion stools around round tables. \n\nThe meal is a 7 course prix fixe $35 per person (no a la carte menu), although they do have vegetarian alternatives to the meat dishes. The only menu they hand you is the drinks menu, which ranges from beer to wine to rose water to Coca cola. The menu is as follows:\n\nFirst course: 3 salads, eggplant, tomato-cucumber, and carrot\nSecond course: phyllo pastry filled with chicken and egg with powdered sugar and cinnamon on top. Vegetarian alternative is without chicken, just egg.\nThird course: Whole chicken, slow-cooked, either mild or spicy (we asked for spicy sauce on the side). Vegetarians get a lentil dish.\nFourth course: Either honey lamb or beef shish kebabs, we asked for both. Vegetarians have a spinach-filled rolled pastry.\nFifth course: Couscous topped with chicken, raisins, and vegetables. No chicken for vegetarians.\nSixth course: Fresh fruit bowl\nSeventh course: mint tea and baklava.\n\nThe meal was awful from the start. They sat us all the way at the top floor, in the back - we're pretty sure they continuously forgot about us throughout the meal. Our waiter looked like he was in high school, and it took him 15 minutes to get our drinks (only 4 people ordered anything); in the mean time, the music was so obnoxiously loud we could barely talk to one another, let alone the people next to us, and the air conditioning was so high that I was shivering - and I was wearing a sweater! - and even after asking them to turn it down, it was STILL cold.\n\nConsidering that its a prix fixe menu, you would expect the food to come out quickly, but we waited about 45 minutes for the first course, which isn't even cooked! Our waiter was not attentive in general, and each course took far too long to come out (he also took forever to realize we were done with each dish). The food overall was not good - edible, but where were the spices? The FLAVOR?! My bf said the lamb was good, but otherwise we were all very disappointed in the dishes. And there was waaaay too much food, we felt bad towards the end because of all the wasted food since we could barely have more than a bite of the later courses. The fruit plate mostly went into people's purses. I was most disappointed by the baklava, which was truly awful just phyllo pastry and honey WHERE WERE THE NUTS?! I'm Greek, I love baklava and this was awful. \n\nPerhaps the worst part of the evening, after suffering through awful service, bad food and too much of it, obnoxious atmosphere (which includes a belly dancer going around to each table), the waiter brings the bill and tells us AT THAT MOMENT that they take cash or check but NOT credit cards. They didn't tell us when we made the reservations, they didn't tell us at the beginning of the meal to allow us to run to a bank and get money, they had the audacity to tell us right at the end.

Since its BYO, we had brought two bottles of wine with us to enjoy with a traditional, homestyle Italian meal. They offer the option of having the entire table do family-style tastings, choosing several dishes from the antipasti and pastas, and then individuals order entrees, but we decided a party of our size wouldn't be able to decide very easily, so instead my sister, fiance and I shared dishes. We ordered the polenta of the day which had broccoli rabe, the antipasti misto, and a special beet arugula salad to start, and for our entrees we shared the fish of the day, which was branzino with tomatoes and capers, and their pasta nera alla pescareccia (which I couldn't technically eat because I'm allergic to prawns...but that didn't stop me from tasting the stuff around them).\n\nThe antipasti are all rather small dishes, but we were just able to split them 3 ways. The beet arugula salad also had orange slices and shaved pecorino, and was a bit heavily dressed with vinaigrette, but tasty. The polenta was grilled so it was both crispy and creamy, and the broccoli rabe was cooked perfectly. The antipasti misto was super small - literally 3 artichoke heart halves - so we each got a small bite that also included sliced prosciutto and burrata. My parents and their friends also shared the arugula salad and antipasti mixto (once they saw our plate, they copied our order :P).\n\nWe waited a little bit for our entrees because my father and his friend opted to share the spaghetti aglio ed olio as a mid-course - but no one else ordered a mid-course, so we 'glared' at them to finish up. The branzino was cooked in parchment, so the fillet was nice and tender. Nothing too special, though. The pasta was the better dish, with fresh lump crab meat and large prawns, although the squid ink pappardelle pasta seemed just past the al dente point and was a bit too soft. My mother had their mussels in red sauce antipasti as her entree, which she enjoyed, and her friend had the bistecca di vitello ai tre funghi (her usual favorite dish), and my father and his friend both had the vitello picante (his usual favorite dish).

The pool and gym were also really nice and I have no complaints at all about the above.\n\nBut here is the incident that really puts a wet blanket on my review.  I went there with a few of my friends to see a concert and, fish, and catch up.  We went to the concert on a Saturday night and were out quite late.  The next morning my friend noticed that there was a business card on his dresser that he must not have noticed the night before.  The business card was from an escort!  On the back of the card there was a note that read, \"Thanks for getting me out in the rain for nothing.  You should have canceled.\"  We can only deduce that some \"John\" staying at the hotel gave her the wrong room number or she was in the wrong wing of the hotel.  This must have happened while we were at the concert.  Since my friend was staying in his room alone either a hotel employee let her in or the front desk clerk gave her a key.  The hotel security is going to pull the hall surveillance tapes and do a key lock audit and let my friend know what happened.  Bottom line is that the hotel let an escort into my friend's room while we were out.  Luckily he had put his computer and cash into the room safe or I think he would have been robbed.\n\nI really enjoyed the stay at the the hotel and everything seemed good except for this incident, but this is a pretty big incident.  I also have to say that the hotel security staff was cynical and even went so far as to ask my friend if he had visited any \"Gentlemen's Clubs\" that evening.  It was pretty rude and we didn't care for his insinuations.  I certainly hope that after the hotel concludes their investigation they have a good explanation and are forthcoming with an apology to my friend.\n\nIn any case, I've learned an important lesson.  Always use your room safe.\n\nPS - after the investigation is complete, I'll update this review.", "date": "2009-06-15 23:02:36"}, {"_key": "110201", "_id": "reviews/110201", "_rev": "_fNyp7RG--a", "review_id": "gnSNZJShlw8asnneC2Rb-w", "user_id": "CvZGAp4Q2QgJbYqLG1Fetw", "business_id": "34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg", "stars": 3, "useful": 1, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "text": "Decent and extremely popular with the local crowd, they serve several different smoothies and bowls with a variety of fruits and other healthy ingredients.\n\nWhy the 3 stars?

We also appreciated a visit by Gene Bailey (manager and brother of owner Dave), where we were able to give some feedback\n\n2) The two burgers that I've had (PB&J (pesto, goat cheese, tomato jam on a bison patty) and the Ozark (Ozark mushrooms, caramelized onions, and goat cheese) have both been great. Lots of lots with a good amount of toppings\n\n3) The flavor of the shakes -- we've had the Irish Coffee (delicious) and the Sweet Sweet Bacon (bourbon, candied bacon, salted\ncaramel ice cream). If you're a fan of Pulp Fiction, you'll remember Vincent commenting about the $5 milkshake. Do they put bourbon in this one? Oh yes they do. And is this a good milkshake? Nay, it's a a pretty fucking good milkshake\n\n4) The beer list -- they're keeping it mostly local and there are some excellent beers on tap\n\n5) The house made pickles and catsup, the fries, the smoked onion rings -- I enjoyed all of them\n\nThe \"not so good\":\n\n1) Price -- especially if you enjoy alcoholic beverages, you can rack up some stupid bills. The two times we've been there we've ended up with hefty bills (with tip, over $90 each time). I guess if you're a \"let's split a burger, an order fries, and have one soda each\" type of couple, you'll be able to walk out of there for $20. But, you're not much fun either. So live with that.\n\n2) The consistency of the shakes -- I'd put the Irish Coffee shake up there with anything that Kota or the Fountain offers, but at Bailey's Range, they're just too thin. I know that Kota bought some uber shake machine, and while I'm not buying one for them, at some point, they should upgrade\n\n3) The cheese curds -- I like cheese curds, but admittedly, I expected fried cheese curds. Instead, these are fresh. So Wisconsinites, you've been warned.\n\n4) The rest of the alcoholic drink menu -- just haven't been a fan of anything the beautiful wife has ordered. For instance, The Bermuda is pretty much a Dark & Stormy with passion fruit nectar. But as presented, all you tasted was the passion fruit. Other drinks tasted more fruity/light, but then again, when you've gotten used to drinking mixtologist concoctions all the time, it's probably my palate.\n\n5) The Carolina burger (topped with smoked pork shoulder,\nhouse bbq sauce, sweet & spicy slaw) was so drenched in BBQ sauce that you couldn't taste anything else. The sauce was wonderful, but if you really want this burger, get the sauce on the side so you can moderate the amount you put on.\n\nI really want to love Bailey's Range -- but that doesn't mean that I hate it. More that I was hoping it would be a place where we'd go on a Tuesday night when we don't feel like cooking. Instead, it feels more like a \"we'll come here once a month.\"", "date": "2011-10-31 00:42:39"}, {"_key": "39909", "_id": "reviews/39909", "_rev": "_fNyp8_S--e", "review_id": "yz06HWQXl7LLORcUjdkTRg", "user_id": "y9WhhW724xLQ4p_lGQCQkA", "business_id": "4xEJiEQERBvr2jAZQSeF2g", "stars": 2, "useful": 4, "funny": 3, "cool": 3, "text": "It's really a 2 1/2 star review, but I'm still a little bitter.\n\nSo the beautiful wife and I stopped by Mojo tonight.  We were promptly greeted by the hostess and seated at a table that felt a little \"hidden.\"  But, hey, there was another table in the section occupied, plus the hostess really seemed to put a lot of thought into where to seat us.  When we walked in, I did notice group of staff standing around the bar talking.  Strangely, I thought this was going to be a good thing -- lots of people to promptly bring us food and lots of drinks, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nSo, after being seated and given menus, we had enough time to memorize the menu.  I'm sure I'm just being a dick because it was like 10 minutes, but it wasn't that busy and the conglomeration of staff at the bar was fresh in my mind.\n\nFinally, our assigned server stopped by, expressing surprise that we were there.  Apparently/allegedly, the hostess failed to tell him that he had a table.  At least when he asked how long we had been waiting, I told him \"long enough that we were a minute away from leaving.\"\n\nSo, that unpleasantness aside, we started off with drinks.  I was glad to see that a decent selection of beers on tap (I went with Anchor Steam).  The wine list looked decent, but my menu only had half the list (it had the same page twice).  They do carry Green Truck organic wines and are reasonably priced (though it's not called Green Truck anymore, but I digress).\n\nAnyway, we had (and I can't copy and paste from their online menu, so if you want more details, go look at their website):\n\nTuna -- it's fine, but nothing special.  If anything, the tuna was overshadowed by lots of salad and bread.\n\nBacon wrapped dates stuffed with blue cheese with the balsamic reduction -- these were pretty good, but not mind blowing.\n\nGarlic Chile shrimp and sexy grits -- the consensus was \"this is scampi over grits.  And I have no idea why they're sexy, unless the big chunks of tomato and garlic was part of the sexiness.  Or was that part of the shrimp?  I don't know.   Our server did bring out some bread to sop up the sauce, which was nice.  And the bread was hot, so there's a plus.\n\nChicken kabob (jerk chicken with Key Lime yogurt drizzle) -- with Cafe Natasha so close, I wish we hadn't gotten this.  It was OK, but the sauce was way too sweet.\n\nIt might sound like a lot of food, but the portions are fairly small.\n\nLike any good bell curve, the end of the meal involved us waiting for a bit to get the check.  Oh well.\n\nWhen we left, I couldn't help but notice that there were three servers chatting with the hostess.  It's just weird.  I think they need to utilize their staff better.  Or something.\n\nI don't think we'll be going back -- there's nothing really too exciting going on here.", "date": "2010-08-21 02:51:46"}, {"_key": "58765", "_id": "reviews/58765", "_rev": "_fNyp8gG--p", "review_id": "jbWGDevVHTZovN-d7n48og", "user_id": "y9WhhW724xLQ4p_lGQCQkA", "business_id": "MnKgN5crTUuxROY2aoadtQ", "stars": 3, "useful": 11, "funny": 5, "cool": 9, "text": "Having taken today off from work, the beautiful wife and I visited Plush for lunch.\n\nWhile I recognize that they're still a new place, there were enough \"hmmms\" that three stars seems fair.\n\n1) Service -- our server was nice, though despite there being a giant full bar within view, there don't have a drink menu, nor was anything boozy offered. At times, I think she wasn't sure what to do next when more patrons came in, so hopefully she'll get a better handle on how things flow.\n\n2) Food -- they serve all their menu items all day, so seeing the short rib hash with poached eggs, I knew what I was getting. It was served with a popover and Bearnaise sauce. It was pretty good (the eggs were poached perfectly), but there was enough delay between the food being prepared and getting to our table that the food was a tad above lukewarm (and even worse, the sauce began to set in places). That was a bummer. I also ordered a side of the cheesy grits which must have had an entire wheel of Gouda in them. Way overbearing.\n\nMy accompanying latte was good, though it took a bit for it to show up.\n\nErin had the short rib sloppy joe (which on the menu says \"joes\", which implied slider-sized to us, it's not -- expect a big kaiser-sized bun). I have to note that this was a disappointment. This was a far away from a sloppy joe as there is -- it was more like a chopped short rib sandwich (pretty much, the meat matched my dish exactly in preparation) with a light sauce mixed in. The onion straws were fine but her accompanying tabbouleh was a disappointment (we saw an order of fries that looked pretty damn awesome. Next time, go for fried foods).\n\n3) Atmosphere -- in the noontime daylight, I can't say I approve. The floor is \"rustic\" (nice way of saying that it looks like it wasn't fixed up) and the overall color scheme is \"out of date appliance avocado green.\" In the main dining room, there are booths along the walls, with a number of individual tables and chairs in the middle (while the chair sets at each table appeared to match, none of them matched the rest).

Kind of like provel cheese or the Cardinals. Having lived in Southern IL for awhile, our options were limited, and we typically were only able to get our hands on custard.\n\nNow that we've moved into the city of St. Louis, we have access to delicious ice creams and gelatos. I thought we'd never go back to custard again, especially not to a custard-serving establishment that was some traditional Cardinal fan haven.\n\nBut for some reason last night, I thought it would be nice to go to Ted Drewes. The weather was only a little chilly and we thought it might be nice to take our dog out for a joy ride. And I was kind of feeling like a nostalgic St. Louisan. The St. Louis feels are overtaking my body and that scares me.\n\nI don't know why I even wanted to go. The last (and really only) time I remember going, I ordered the cookie sandwich, which was -- in a word -- disgusting. I think I have to chalk that up to the fact that Dad's Cookies (oatmeal) taste like hell. In fact, they all taste like hell. But that's another review for another time.\n\nI ordered another simple pleasure this time, a.k.a. not a sundae or concrete with gobs of hot fudge, peanut butter cups, etc. Which, don't get me wrong, I love. I just wasn't feeling it last night. So I ordered three scoops of custard dipped in chocolate in a cake cone. Simple AND inexpensive, this treat will run you about $2.50. In the overpriced world of frozen confections, this is considered a steal.\n\nBest dipped cone I have ever eaten, as far as dipped cones go. Mostly because I'm used to the dipped cones at Dairy Queen where the \"ice cream\" runs like diarrhea. And even though Ted Drewes only has one flavor of custard (vanilla...boring), it was still the best custard I've tried. Would it kill them to serve chocolate as a flavor, though?\n\nI ended up feeding the bottom part of the cone to our dog (no signs of chocolate anywhere...back off, PETA). It was probably the best thing that has happened to him, short of getting adopted. Then again, he eats his own vomit, so I'm not sure it was an indication of anything.\n\nI don't know whether to rate this a 3 or a 5. It's a 5, in terms of custard and a 3, in terms of frozen confections. Might even be a 2, as the place was packed and rife with Cardinals fans. Since I'm feeling generous, I'll give it 3 stars.\n\nNext time, we'll probably just bite the bullet and muster up enough energy to drive to the Clayton Rd. Schnucks, park, walk in, and order some delicious Benitos gelato.

The place can be jumpin' in a packed house and still, somehow, magically, 2 bar stools will open up and voila... we have a seat.\n\nIt's the day before New Years Eve...  New Orleans is packed with tourists, drunks, and misfits.  Every damn bar, every restaurant, good or bad, was packed.  No reservations.  All first come, first serve.  There was a line around 3 Muses like it was the hottest club in Manhattan.  We walked up to the hostess, where she proceeded to tell us that they weren't even taking anymore names.  We were both sorely disappointed.  All week we were looking forward to coming here.  It was the best food we had on our first trip to the city.\n\nAnyway...  \nWe walked away like 2 kids that just lost their pup.  We wandered around the open market across the street when The Man says, \"Hey.. Let's go back and see if we can get lucky.\"  I looked at him like, \"Are you out of your goddamned mind?!\"  Ugh...  but, I agreed.  I waited across the street while I watched him have a few words with the hostess.  He signals me to come over, and \"BAM!!\".  The hostess tell us to wait at the bar and have a drink and she'll call us when there was a table available.\n\nI fuckin love this man...\nWe walked over to the bar to order a couple of cocktails, and what happens???  2 bar stools open up right in front of us and we're in...  UNBELIEVABLE.\n\nThe food...\nStill the best damn food in NOLA.  The menu I noticed has changed so I won't go into details of what we ate because it'll probably change again but expect to be blown away by an explosion of flavors.

But since having an aversion, it wasn't something that has interested me since.\n\nI'm not really quite sure where the wild hare came from, but when I saw the reviews, I really wanted chicken makhani, which pleased my husband to no end, since he's been denied Indian food for the last two years.  \n\nWe went in around 6 and it was dead.

It saddens me how Chicago's seafood can not even begin to compare to what the folks down in New Orleans get to eat.\n\n* Pate of Louisiana rabbit and duck livers: I developed a newfound appreciation for/obsession with pate from my trip to Paris last year.  Luke's pate was absolutely phenomenal.  The pate is served in a little jar and comes with an assortment of garnishes as well as some \"country bread croutons\".  After we went through the first batch of croutons, we got a second helping and proceeded to polish that off too.  That's how good the pate was.  \n\n* Moules et Frites: A French bistro staple, Luke's version of it did not disappoint.  First off, the portions are absolutely massive and the mussels themselves are ridiculously plump and fresh.  Our server taught us a little trick on how to use the mussel shells as pinchers for removing the meat -- so clever and effective!  The mussel broth made for a perfect dipping sauce for the frites.  Terrific dish and yet another reminder of how New Orleans seafood kicks major ass.\n\nI also got a cocktail called the French 75, which was basically cognac, lemon juice and champagne.  Very refreshing on a hot muggy day!\n\nService was terrific -- friendly and polite, what one would expect dining in the South.

I am way into the homemade truffle potato chips and the the white bean bruschetta. Those are under the $4 bar menu. i've also enjoyed the bacon dusted calamari, which was real tasty.\nOne time, my sister ordered the applesauce something or other wings...they were very bland and tasted like nothing other than warm applesauce.

That's about it. Because it's, like, a grocery store. With groceries.And sometimes wifi.\n\nWay back when I was stocking my cabinets with food instead of books, Dierbergs (and Trader Joe's) was a weekly run. I bought the hell out of couscous, cheese, sparkling grape juice and fruit leather. The cheese packaged in-store was phenomenal, plus I loved having an entire aisle dedicated to organic/natural/special diet items. Being able to pick up vitamins, sweet potato chips, dark chocolate, frozen Indian meals and toothpaste within 10 feet was perfect. The selection for these items was greater than at Schnucks, and the store always was cleaner. You'd pay $0.50-$1 more for things, but that was an acceptable trade-off. Also, huzzah for the store being at a Metrolink stop!\n\nDierbergs still has all of that, but I use the store completely differently now. These days, I go for lunch, snacks and wifi. I grab fresh fruit from the produce section, make a salad from the bar, pick up a $0.50 bottle of water and head to the cafe area to eat while writing. The store still works, but over the past few months, I've had some setbacks.\n\nSalad bar:\n- Not the best selection/variety of toppings. \n- Bar always is messy. \n-Labels are used only about half the time.\n- Not as vegetarian friendly as it first appears. Kidney beans are usually the only kind of vegetarian protein available, and those aren't put out all the time. Meaty toppings/pasta salads often are in back, so customers spill them into the vegetarian ones toward the front during the reach. Labels don't have vegetarian notation, and it's hard to see what's in some of the pastas. Hot soups aren't vegetarian, despite being broccoli or vegetable (usually made with meat-based stock/broth -- I asked).\n\nWifi cafe:\n- Convenient nook at the front of the store. Bright and pleasant, thanks to large windows.\n- Out of about 14 tables/booths, only one of them has an outlet, and it's not accessible unless you're sitting in that booth.\n- Wifi takes forever to be recognized and then to connect. Sometimes it doesn't happen at all.\n- If wifi is working, it's often very slow. It also bans you from most streaming media (No, I'm not trying to watch Netflix, but for my job I often need to listen to individual songs or watch videos embedded within blog posts). Despite this, Spotify works for some reason, though not well.\n- There are no utensils near the cafe area, so if you drop your fork, you have to go all the way back to the salad bar to get it - not awesome when you've already got your laptop and such strewn about. Why not stock some utensils at the cafe area with the coffee cups and napkins?\n\nGenerally, I like Dierbergs. If I actually kept food at my place, I'd likely buy some of it here. And having a store and wifi cafe in the inner ring is nice for a quick stop between clients. But even though Dierbergs is a little better than regular Schnucks stores, it could learn a LOT about salad bar arrangement and maintenance and wifi cafes from Schnucks' Culinaria model downtown.", "date": "2014-01-20 19:22:32"}, {"_key": "113107", "_id": "reviews/113107", "_rev": "_fNyp7V---s", "review_id": "FIUvqrMpkyNXr99VTDkAhw", "user_id": "VVNj3hSE8drWCu8xUXH05Q", "business_id": "vOgQnvKbE4nMopFTjoL8Gg", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Came here for our wedding anniversary a few years back.

The corn was really finely pureed and was more pasty. I would have liked more chunky corn, but that's my preference. The batter was crispy, but not as cornmeal-like as I was expecting. But then again I don't eat too much Puero Rican food so I didn't know what to expect!

I've eaten plantains at Cuban restaurants, so I was expecting this lasagna to have a bit of sweetness to it. It was delicious. Two plantains on top and bottom with plenty of creamed spinach to fill the middle, topped with a top on hot melted cheese. It was very delicious. For my side, I got the mofongo (mashed plantains with garlic). It was a bit dry. It could have used more garlic sauce, which I guess was the tiny bit of sauce drizzled on the plate next to it (there was no sauce on the dish or given to me on the side).\n\nMy husband had the Arroz con pollo (yellow rice with chicken).

As a fan of Old Fashions, I cannot recommend the Smoke and Oak enough. In addition to being an absolutely superb drink, it comes with actual smoke (no spoilers, but it's really worth it). Second to that I really have to recommend the Sazerac. It's the perfect balance of your traditional Old Fashioned with a zip.\n\nMy recommendation would be to share plates between people. The mushrooms and popcorn chicken are amazing. \n\nIf you're not looking for a large meal to share between two people, just a main for yourself, I strongly recommend the double cut flank steak.  \n\nWhatever you chose, you really can't go wrong.

One was a really yummy tofu dish, where the tofu was fried but then cooked in a sauce so the consistency was nice and soft, with some veggies throughout. (For reference, it was named after a woman who was known for her crazy beauty, so a cultural equivalent of this dish's name would be something like \"Helen of Troy Tofu\" or something?)

I went with the donkey urine, with it being the best of the options available.\n\nMy mother-in-law comes out of the restroom and tells the bartender that the restroom was disgusting and the toilet would not flush, she wanted to make sure that someone knew. His response was to the effect of \"I don't use the women's restroom, and I don't fix them.\" Then he continued to berate my mother-in-law in the open restaurant regarding how dare anyone talk to him like that.

Standard customer service response is simple. \"I'm sorry to hear that. We will have someone check it out as soon as possible. Thank you for bringing it to our attention.\" Not some tirade over how you don't use the ladies room, that you don't fix restrooms in general, that you won't tolerate being treated that way, and how you are entitled to treat patrons like that if you feel offended that they pointed out that the restroom was broken and unsanitary.\n\nI invited my mother in law and wife to leave the restaurant and tried to no avail to talk Frank out of his self-righteous tree.

This confusion extends to the kitchen, wherein the recent chef switcheroo of Michael Stevenson for Leo Forneas has led to the restaurant's refocus from the pure Southern bourbon and blues motif that previously and not very successfully defined them since opening a few years ago.\n\nOn a normal day, this would be enough in itself, but I chose to visit during Mother's Day, pretty much the worst day for dining out, especially when you're part of a party of eight. So the service, while not bad, per se, gets a pass. What doesn't get a pass is the prix fixe menu from which we were forced to order. The menu consisted of literally every item of their normal brunch menu, plus a couple of desserts, for a significantly higher price than normal. So say you wanted to order the salad and buttermilk chicken sandwich - $15 on a normal Sunday. $35 on Mother's Day. But you got a choice of beignets or panna cotta for dessert, so I'm sure that warranted the extra markup. Needless to say, I made it a priority to choose the absolute most expensive things on their normal brunch menu.\n\nAnother problem with just throwing your entire menu onto a prix fixe is portion sizes. My tuna tartare was simply mixed with the occasional sliced cornichon and served alongside a few potato chips, but it was fresh and a good size to prime to palate for the rest of the meal. Some of my fellow diners got the pigs in a blanket, which were nearly a main course in themselves. After plowing through a few of them, multiple people remarked at how full they were getting, and the main course hadn't even arrived yet. \n\nThe Maryland Crab cake eggs benedict isn't what you'd expect to find in a Southern-slanted restaurant, but I'm glad it's here, because the crab cakes were almost all crab, and went really well with the eggs (poached well for me, though others weren't so lucky), mustard hollandaise, and English muffin. Serving them alongside french fries seemed like they just didn't want to take the time to prepare an additional starch, and I didn't want to take the time to eat the underwhelming slices of potato. \n\nFried dough is an easy crowd pleaser, and the beignets hit the spot, even if they were still a little doughy. The gluten-free diner amongst us described her panna cotta as \"interesting,\" and not in a good way, though she seemed unfamiliar with the dish. \n\nTo be honest, the combination of food and company provided an overall positive experience at Twisted Tail, though there were enough missteps to not make it a priority to return.

Frankly, having seen Nashville Airport , the Country Music Hall of Fame, and so many other sites around the city, I found this arena surprisingly lacking in upscale amenities.  We were in the upper bowl...this one was very steep and cramped...there was little room on the landing, seats were very narrow, and the rows were very closely spaced. The seats themselves were comfortable, but the stupid cup holders were too small to hold anything (at least they could not hold the reg size soda or bottled water we bought)...who designed this?? The men's room near us was also very small and cramped...it had three urinals, three sinks (no mirrors), and one entrance/exit.  As a result...LONG lines. Finally, and I can't honestly say I remember too well, but I can't recall seeing ANY auxiliary scoreboards/displays other than the large central one. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't remember seeing a single out of town score?\n\nMost importantly (for me at least), the food was expensive and completely nondescript...we could have been anywhere in the country. The only local nod was some BBQ nachos, and these were only available at a few scattered locations. Otherwise, you could get PLAIN burgers, hot dogs, fries, nachos. No dressed up anything! SO BORING! As expected, it was also pretty bad. \n\nThe game experience itself wasn't anything special either...what was memorable was what had to be the worst introduction/rev up to face-off I have ever seen at a pro game. After warm ups, the teams clear the ice, the lights dim, and the announcer cranks up the music. You then watch a montage on screen for  ten minutes while they send the Zambonis out to resurface the ice. Then they lower a giant Preds head, crank the music again...and you watch another montage. Then the cheerleaders come on and slide by while the music is still cranked. Finally, the players from both teams kind of infiltrate the ice while the announcer plays the player introduction montage (but the starters are already on the ice so it's not like they spotlight them). At this point, your ears are bleeding since they ironically (you are in Music City after all) don't understand the meaning of crescendo and everything has been at \"11\" for twenty minutes. \n\nIt is hard to say anything about the game atmosphere and fans since the Avs put three on the board in the first period alone. However, even though they announced that the game was a sellout, there were many empty seats at face off, and it never really got loud, even when it was still a game. The announcer definitely could have done a better job psyching up the fans...as it was, it seemed he just preferred to play the usual rock anthem snippets and unending crowd cam shots.

We started off with a bottle of Merlot and ordered the smoked deep fried soft shell crab and a cup of seafood gumbo. When the soft shell arrived I was taken back how large it was and tasted divine. The gumbo was also yummy and contained generous amounts of seafood.\n\nFor dinner I selected the Flounder, fried green tomato, and stuffed mirliton. OMG this entree was so delish. The fish was superb and the stuffed mirliton which was my first time experiencing and was delish. I can honestly say I experienced authentic Cajun food at Redemption. I sampled the stuffed gulf shrimp with crab stuffing and the taste was also outstanding. We ended our magnificent meal with the Crepes with Louisiana strawberries\n\nWhat's funny is how I stumbled onto Redemption's by dinning at their casual sister restaurant earlier in the week which is located in Prairieville - Tommy's Fish house. Christian who runs Tommy's recommended Redemption. \n\nWe had the pleasure to meet the owner of Redemption Marie and head chef Greg Picolo who were gracious to spend some time with us and make us feel welcomed.

The atmosphere is beautiful. The walls, a deep velvety maroon with a collection of antiques and gorgeous New Orleans decor. You can see the attention to detail. There are no spots on the water glasses or silver. The table cloths are immaculate.\n\nThere is nothing too complicated on the menu, just delicious Cajun & Creole food. There is a table d'hote option which I like because you get a full course meal for one price. The wine selection is broad and desserts are heavenly. The bread they bring to your table is unbelievably soft and warm and served with an herb butter. \n\nA reservation is recommended but there are times when you can walk in for lunch or dinner also. It is an expansive restaurant in a gorgeous french quarter building. Appropriate attire should be worn (no shorts and flip flops) but it does not require a sport coat. I like to wear a dress to dinner anyways, there is something about fancy New Orleans dining that calls for being dressed pretty. If you are wearing a ball cap they will ask you to remove it and I appreciate that. I like that they maintain their standards and hold strong to those policies. If you want to eat in your outside clothes, go to an oyster house. Please, have respect for yourself and the other diners. : )\n\nWe have had beautiful, consistent food, every time, with some of the best service we've ever had anywhere.

About seven round tables that could fit maybe three people (might be able to fit four, but highly unlikely) and some room at the bar.  Came for lunch at 11:30am when they opened, and by about 12:15pm, all the tables and most of the seats at the bar were taken.  \n\nWe were the second group to be seated, and although there was no one else in the restaurant at the time, our waitress seemed to be preoccupied after taking our order.  She knew we were still deciding on drinks, so why didn't she check on us again?  Hello!  She wasn't very attentive and seemed like she would rather be elsewhere.\n\nI ordered the Village Burger (an 8 ounce burger on a sesame roll with Boston bibb lettuce, tomato, and house-made thousand island dressing: $11) and added Jasper Hill cheddar cheese ($3.50) and fried egg ($1.50).  Perfect brunch meal right?  Eh.  Was just okay.  The burger wasn't anything spectacular, definitely not anything to rave about.  It was juicy, but lacked flavor.  Usually the bun makes the burger (for me at least), and I thought the sesame roll was okay.  Tasted like an everyday burger bun to me.  The cheddar cheese and fried egg were a nice additional to the burger.  At 8 ounces, this burger is pretty huge!  Could definitely serve as another meal or late night snack.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EtKSTHV5Qx_Q7Aur9o4kQQ?select=QZ4Yn47TLprQlbCRWMtZdw\n\nWe also ordered the duck fat french fries with sly-fox cheddar sauce ($7) to share.  I've always always wanted to try duck fat fries.  These left me wanting more.  Really...is this what they really taste like?  I hope not.  These fries were more soggy than crispy, and left a weird after taste in my mouth.  The cheddar sauce was a welcomed additional, but not necessary.  The sauce would have been better if it was hotter.  \n\nWhen our waitress finally came back with our food, we were able to order the Irish Car Bomb shake ($9).  Ours definitely didn't look like a lot of the pictures that were posted on Yelp.  For $9, this shake better be spectacular!  Again, it was just okay.  I did enjoy those chunks of brownie pieces though! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EtKSTHV5Qx_Q7Aur9o4kQQ?select=EbqJLiD6Pkw7u1KgFVmJAA\n\nRG ordered the Whiskey King (an 8 ounce burger on a sesame roll with maple bourbon glazed ciopollini, rogue bleu cheese, applewood bacon, and foie gras-$26).  Massive burger.  The bleu cheese was almost non-existent.  I tried a bite, and the foie gras was pretty good.  The applewood bacon was a nice touch.

It was perfectly comfortable and operated exactly as I had hoped, so the decision was made. \n\nTwo bikes, lights for front and back, a basket and bell for mine, a bike lock for both etc and the team in the back of the shop worked quickly to get the bikes customized for us as we paid up all the while learning about incredible riding trails and local bike events - even monthly pub and restaurant crawls - and then rode them home. \n\n\nBuying local is important to me and the selection and service was top notch here. You get what you pay for and more and your purchase also includes a free tune up a month or so after owning your bike plus a warranty on top of the manufacturer's warranty. \n\nWhen you are in need of a bike or accessories, even just some valuable free bike related advice, this is a great place to check out!", "date": "2015-09-25 16:02:40"}, {"_key": "96850", "_id": "reviews/96850", "_rev": "_fNyp9me--A", "review_id": "8BGYrpqDFe-A_bB3V6iPLQ", "user_id": "GZ_000Yr72OFcKv9ZaBseA", "business_id": "ZiQiMlvgk19GrEEkN9kyRA", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This cafe is a great place to do work or study.

Now it's time to review the main vehicle of that vacation: Carnival Cruise Lines....\n\nI have to say that I'm pretty disappointed in carnival.  There are a variety of reasons why and I'll attempt to illustrate them fully below:\n\n1 - They charge you for Soda.   Yeah I know.  I mean seriously? Soda is like the cheapest thing in the world and you have the gall to charge me like 3 bucks for can of Coke?  Get off me.  Sure you have an \"unlimited plan\" but you'd need to drink soda like me in college to get your money's worth.\n\n2 - Diamonds International. It's really sad to me that Carnival has either purchased land or worked with each of the ports to create an identical mall at each port that contains not 1, not 2, but 3 freaking Diamonds Internationals at each location.  Then they drop you off and effectively hold you hostage in these cookie cutter malls shoving \"cheap\" jewelry, souveniers and lots of other \"americanized shit\" into your face.  I didn't go Cozumel to get a t-shirt from Ron Jon Surf Shop, get a drink at Fat Tuesdays and buy diamonds.  I went to experience local culture and to lay on a beach.\n\n3 - Shore Excursions. Much like above, the cruise line makes it difficult for you to do anything without the purchase of a \"shore excursion\".    This includes laying on the beach.  Shockingly, at every port we are far away from the beach and to get there you generally need to take local transportation and/or buy an \"excursion\".  The excursion costs like $50 a person.  For the beach.  I mean cmon.  I'd say that's a bit overkill.  Can I go to a local taxi and get there?  Generally yeah, but guess what?  Those dudes know that your only alternative is a $50 excursion and they price themselves accordingly.  Oh and most excursions start at 8 am. Totally not my thing.\n\n4 - Food.  I'll be honest, I wasn't impressed.  They have a ton of variety and the buffets and main dining room have reasonable hours.  But the buffet wasn't as good as a nice Casino Buffet and the dining room food felt like food from an overly-produced wedding reception.  The steak house was \"ok\".  My jaunt over to Elways at Cherry Creek here in Denver with Ladyhawk for our anniversary was 10 times better on a pure food level.\n\nSo at this point you must be saying, \"geez Nick, you didn't enjoy yourself on vacation!\"  You'd be wrong.  I loved spending a week relaxing, playing cards, reading and exploring new places with my wonderful wife.  It was a blast.  I'll even try a cruise again someday, just not with Carnival.  \n\nThe hidden gem in our excursions and searching?  Isla Roatan in Honduras.  That place is very beautiful and Anthony's Key Resort on that island is a place I'll go back to sometime.

Because I found out that Elmo can really bite. He is a monster after all. \n\nThe servers are so great with kids and yet you sit in that swanky dark mahogany bar atmosphere and feel like you are human again after a day at Sesame Place. I actually think JB DAWSON's is the reason we went back after our dinner. I downed my steak and two beers, looked at my adorable 3 year old who was quietly coloring on the kid menu they have, turned to my husband and said, \"Wanna be parents of the year, and take her back to see the parade?\" Swiftly, he responded, \"Let's do it. Go big or go home.\"\n\nAll the waitstaff works together here too. I don't know if they pool tips, but it's like some sorta family feeling they give you as if the waitress' big brother just took over her shift so she could go help mom in the kitchen. So rare to find fast, efficient, and dependable hosting like that in a restaurant these days. \n\nBeing from New York City and eating at an array of places over the years (with plenty of annoyed waitstaff), this place reminded me of Gorgios of Gramercy in terms of atmosphere and service. And it was child friendly which always scores well with me.\n\nMy only constructive criticism: my newborn has a dairy allergy and an overwhelming majority of the dishes and sides have butter, milk, or cheese in them. They made me a beautiful plate of steak, but all the higher priced sides I was supposed to get, I could not have. So I paid the same amount for two less filling sides....basically steamed broccoli (which was actually amazing) and fries. An additional side of something small like corn or rice, would have made it even-steven. But I loved my meal.

You check the website and the only date that was available was the day after the Groupon's expiration date.\n\nHmm...Plan B.\n\nDecides to email her directly and email Groupon just in case I can't use it.

However, it's a residential building and does not have any company name posted. Look for the house with the little white fence.

I was finally greeted by Dawna after what looks like the owner of the building came in and shut the door. \n\nDawna does everything herself. So there's a bit of a wait before, during, and after the session. This was my first time at acupuncture and I actually did feel something working immediately after I finished the treatment. I came in for multiple ailments but she concentrated on the main aspect of my problem. BTW, the treatment was relaxing since I was lying down for 30 minutes but the actual treatment was a little bit shorter than I expected compare to the other reviewers. Also the massage was a bit shorter than I expected. Nevertheless, this place should be tranquil enough after she updates it with some furnishings since it is really bare at the moment.

They've expanded the dessert pie to include pecan pie and they have some more drink options than opening week too.\n\nWe came back and just went with the classic white and dark, pairing them up with the pommery honey mustard and chipotle lime mayo, and I'd have to say I think the honey mustard sauce is my new favorite!

They were only open for 2 hours yesterday because that's all it took to sell out of their chicken. \n\nTonight, a small line was already forming before the 5 pm opening time. \n\nSimple concept - choose your chicken (classic or special) & choose between white tenders or boneless thighs. Cost is $8.95/lb so pick and choose what you want and move on to the sauces. 6 sauces to choose from (chipotle lime mayo, Thai red curry peanut, green goddess ranch, pommery honey mustard, modern BBQ, and pimenton aioli). Choose your drink and dessert if you want and you're on your way upstairs to the dining area or out the door to shovel it in in the privacy of your own place. \n\nWe went with 3 pieces of each of the chicken (classic tenders, classic boneless thighs, special tenders and special boneless thighs). Total was a little more than a pound and was just over $11. The batter was pretty light for the classic and a little bit more thick and interesting for the special. Not overbearing and definitely able to be enjoyed in its own. Both the tenders and boneless thighs were plenty juicy and flavorful and all in all well-cooked. Personally, I liked the classic better than the special but I still think it's worth trying and figuring out what you like. 4/5 for chicken. \n\nSauces: went with 3 that caught my eye - Thai red curry peanut, chipotle lime mayo, and green goddess ranch. I'd say my favorite was the green goddess ranch but I'm always a fan of ranch and fried chicken. A really close second was the chipotle lime mayo. Really can appreciate the chipotle and lime flavors and it's really well-balanced. Wasn't a huge fan of the Thai red curry peanut. I got a lot more peanut than Thai red curry. And with the other options just being so good, I didn't find myself going back to the peanut. 4/5\n\nApple and pumpkin pies - Wow. Both just were excellent. Flaky, crispy crusts, and neither were too sweet. Personally I was a little shocked that I came here for their fried chicken and felt their dessert outshined the fried chicken. 5/5\n\nSnap juice & tea Co. (Fresh lime, agave, cayenne) - delish. Didn't really get much of the heat from the cayenne but I definitely liked it a lot. Fresh, crisp, bright, just really good with the heaviness of the fried chicken, dipping sauces and fried pies. 5/5\n\nAlso they have 6 different fountain drink offerings with no high fructose corn syrup - cane sugar is the sweetener. Orange mango was my favorite and watermelon was a close second. There is a cola, birch beer, a berry flavored one and a diet cola. Also they have Cheerwine for those of you Carolinians who know what that's all about. \n\nReally a great start. Hopefully they don't run out of chicken and have to close early consistently. \n\nWill definitely be back. \n\nAnd hopefully in future there will be some side options. The meal can certainly feel a little unbalanced/heavy without some vegetables. Maybe at least a pickle or something would do.

I was very wary of this place the first time I came in; generally speaking, when I start seeing a whole lot of \"Gluten Free\" and \"Vegan\" and \"Healthy,\" I get nervous that I'm going to leave hungry and cranky, since I'm not one of those people who can eat a few leaves of kale and be all like, \"OMG! It was so flavorful and FILLING!\"  That said, I did NOT leave Deluxe hungry either time, and I am very impressed that this restaurant can find a nice balance between meeting several dietary restrictions while still keeping things fun for the omnivores.\n\nOn my breakfast visit I had the Deluxe Scramble, a dish chock-full of good stuff.  Reviewers below indicate that this dish is a crazy amount of food, and it really isn't, unless you have a very small stomach.  I would say, though, that it is ENOUGH food for an Amazon like me.  I was very happy with the coffee, and pleased that they offered pumpernickel toast, because you just don't see that very often.  For my lunch visit I tried the Apple Cheddar Melt, which was SO delicious but difficult to eat, and a cup of Potato Leek soup.  The flavor of the soup was good, but it was a bit thick and chunky for my taste. The ice tea was top-notch, but in Reno in summer, you need to either use bigger cups for tea or offer faster refills.  (I could write a whole essay on this idea alone: \"Minimum Required Ice-Tea Cup Sizes for Summer Consumption in the Desert: A Study.\")\n\nThe food, though, is not the best thing about Deluxe.  There are two other aspects of this business that will keep me coming back.  1)  The service.  Everybody here is wonderfully friendly and welcoming.  Why this is so rare today, I don't know, but the warmth of service here is a real pleasure.  2)  The history.  It isn't just the historic building here that is great, but the effort they put into presenting the history within the restaurant.  Apart from telling the story on the menu and their web-site, the room is lined with historic photographs from the Wells Avenue neighborhood.  It is a really cool touch, and the first time I visited I wandered the entire restaurant with my coffee taking in all the great images and imagining what this area used to look like sixty years ago.\n\nAlthough I don't feel the extreme enthusiasm for Cafe Deluxe that many do, I still really enjoy it here and will continue to drop in when I'm in the area.", "date": "2015-06-11 15:37:31"}, {"_key": "112377", "_id": "reviews/112377", "_rev": "_fNyp7UC--s", "review_id": "vzfOvE9pYrnWAYkrX4AFWA", "user_id": "m-n_AHwndmHAgZIsu52kYA", "business_id": "e0p9iyX1VfEQs1zP2WA-gQ", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "For the size, Dharma Books has a pretty good selection.

Although we first stopped at a more famous tiki establishment next door, we were told by the surly hostess there that we weren't allowed to wait for a spot at the bar, so we left and came here instead. Well, there were plenty of seats at the bar at Tiki Tolteca, which I didn't really understand because this is A Very Cool Place.\n\nThis bar will always hold a special place in my heart because it was here that I discovered my love for tiki drinks. You see, although I've always loved tiki style, I'd steered clear of tiki drinks for one very stupid reason--I hate coconut. I had always assumed (what a noob) that tiki drinks are all filled with coconut (I mean...in my defense...they ARE often served in coconut shells!). So it was with trepidation that I read over the menu and finally said \"OK, I guess...I'll just have the zombie.\"\n\nMy first zombie. What a moment. It's not often in one's 40s that one discovers something new and exciting, but here it was . It was always there and I was TOO BLIND TO SEE! I. Loved. That. Zombie. My God...the FLAVOR! And NO coconut at all! Just layer after layer of rum and spice and citrus and more rum and even more rum...it was one of the best cocktails I had ever had. After two full days of drinking in New Orlean's finest bars, and here was a revelation. I tried Husband's Dr. Funk, and holy shit...I loved that, too!\n\nAnd so it was that my current tiki obsession was born...in a nearly empty tiki bar above a Mexican restaurant. To be honest, if the bartender had been a bit more sociable, he could have probably reeled me into sitting there for the rest of the night throwing all my money at him, I was so happy. But as other reviewers have mentioned, there's not a lot of warmth coming from behind the bar at this establishment, which is why I dropped them half a point.

It's one of those wicked-overkill dishes that you just can't pass up. Eat the crab, nibble at the pasta, bring the rest home for a great pasta leftover if you don't want to overindulge.\n\nMy wife did the build-your-own pasta--Chef Scott's comments on why this is on his menu inspired a separate blog post I'll do later this week. She got rigatoni with chicken in a creamy alfredo sauce. The chicken was grilled nicely and the sauce subtely seasoned for a good match.\n\nWe usually let Chef surprise us for dessert, and he rarely steers us wrong. This time it was \"Red Velvet Elvis\" cake...deadly!\n\nDrinks-I had a couple of Abita Ambers, wife had a couple of glasses of the house Pinot Grigio. A great meal on a lovely spring evening!", "date": "2012-06-04 14:49:59"}, {"_key": "82844", "_id": "reviews/82844", "_rev": "_fNyp9NO--O", "review_id": "u-KVunhLSWGuTyM7YQYoYg", "user_id": "BrFSDMl2V85mW9UtbAeUAg", "business_id": "pym7c6ZFEtmoH16xN2ApBg", "stars": 5, "useful": 8, "funny": 4, "cool": 7, "text": "In many ways, I'm a creature of habit, and when it comes to dining in Mid City, my \"habits\" are Mandina's and Liuzza's.  I'd been saying for ages that I'd go to @katiesmidcity, and never got past Bienville Street.  I finally did, and I'm a changed person.\n\nKatie's is a classic NOLA neighborhood place; the decor and menu reflect this, right down to the \"Bring the Wood!\" bat (from the Saints' Super Bowl season) hanging up behind the bar.  They've got Abita Amber on tap, cementing my relationship with the place solidly.\n\nMy first trip to Katie's was lunch with a friend.  She grazed on the Grilled Chicken Salad while I had the \"Terranova\" pizza.  More on the pizza later.  It was good, friend was very happy with the salad, and the first visit was a win!  A week or two later, I decided to come back for lunch, and sat at the bar.  I ordered the mushroom-swiss burger with grilled onions.  As you can see, it was a winner, a solid half-pound patty, a good bun, and fresh toppings.  Gotta love the Saints paper lining the basket!  Even though Katie's does a most-excellent burger, that may be the last one I get.  The reason is simple: there are other places that do a good burger and Katie's does so many other things so well.  \n\nThird trip to Katie's was with family for dinner.  They were skeptical-you think I'm bad about Liuzza's?  You should hear my boys.  We started with basic cheese fries (no debris gravy).  The boys both had the hickory burger (hickory sauce, swiss cheese, bacon).  Wife had a shrimp po-boy and I got the fried green tomato and shrimp sandwich.  The boys killed the burgers and wife's sandwich disappeared almost as fast.  I found my sandwich a bit dry, not enough remoulade sauce.  I tweeted as much, and not five minutes later, Chef Scott came by the table to see what was wrong.  I've never seen such a fast reaction in my life!  I was extremely flattered when he offered to bring me some more remoulade sauce (which is one of the best in town, to be sure).  Alas, I had eaten all of the po-boy already.  It wasn't bad, mind you, I just thought it could use more sauce to balance the french bread.  As an appetizer (sans bread), it would've been just right.  The combination of the flavors is fantastic.  If you get this sandwich, though, be sure to ask them for extra remoulade sauce.\n\nMy most recent visit to Katie's was last week, another business lunch.  My colleague had the chicken quesadilla, and I got another Terranova pizza, since the photo of the first one didn't come out well at all.  I'm glad this one did, so not only can I include it in this post, but because I'll be writing a second one where I proclaim this pizza the Best in New Orleans.  Just look at it-wonderful!  Chef Scott did point out that, to make this one hit home with me (I'd been spotted coming in), he brushed the crust with his olive-oil/garlic sauce before putting the marinara on.  (He said anybody can ask for that, btw.)  Even without that extra touch, however, this is a wonderful pizza.  Others I know swear by the Yardbird (chicken, onions, tomato, feta, with the olive oil/garlic sauce), but I refer sausage pizzas when I know it's good sausage.  The Terranova gets its name from Terranova's Supermarket over in Faubourg St. John, and their most wonderful Italian sausage.  \n\nChef Scott also treated us to a wonderful cheesecake for dessert, but alas, my batteries died before I could get a picture.  We'll give dessert a better treatment on the next trip.\n\nKatie's is more than just a solid neighborhood place.  There's some tasty and creative food here.  We go to a neighborhood restaurant for comfort food, or to have a beer with friends.  Katie's is a destination for more than just those things--it's a place for a truly enjoyable dining experience.", "date": "2010-12-01 00:33:00"}, {"_key": "83220", "_id": "reviews/83220", "_rev": "_fNyp9N2--H", "review_id": "IWKsW82UPXjn3vMbAkeXfw", "user_id": "GIMg5oHqsJXdRq_7tR2jjQ", "business_id": "D5V0Fawd6ODVgqCY8xngsw", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Overall I had a great experience here:\n\nPros\n- Costumer service is top notch\n- 24 hour room service, which is surprisingly good.

My son saw a commercial for Chuck E. Cheese a couple months ago and became obsessed with the idea of having his party there. After trying everything I could think of to talk him out of it, I gave in. \n\nI scheduled the party online, which was a cinch. We also got an extra 20 tokens for scheduling online and an extra 100 for having the party on a Sunday. \n\nOur host was Xavier and he was GREAT! Always available, checking in on us and totally on top of everything. They make a big show for the kids celebrating their birthdays: an awesome blow-up crown, air guitar with Chuck E., ticket blaster machine. My boy definitely felt the love. \n\nNow, it's not cheap and the food is what you'd expect. We paid about $250 for a party of 15 kids and 10 adults. And we brought our own cake and party favors. But, in my experience, that's equivalent to how much you'll pay for most other kids' party places. Plus, their games take a lot less tokens than PPP and they have the huge tube that runs across the play room and that's FREE!  And the kids just love that thing! I found that the kids played so much longer without coming back to ask for more tokens than they do at PPP. \n\nFinally, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the awesome security.

We also ordered 3 starters for the table. Spicy shrimp dish (can't remember the name), tuna ceviche and edamame.  Its is really hard to mess up edamame, so that was okay. We did not finish the ceviche, it had no taste at all. The shrimp starter was the high light of the meal. Very good!  My seafood salad was really sad.  I felt like a rabbit eating dry vegetables. I told my server that I wanted to change my dressing to just plain lemon and olive oil. The salad came out with no dressing at all. My friends ahi tuna was pretty bad. Just did not taste fresh and the sauce for dipping was bland. My other friend enjoyed his chicken sandwich. I have two things to say. 1-they seemed to have put more attention into the way the food looked on the plate then the flavor of the food.  The plating was above average.  2- if you go, try to stick to basic dishes that are hard to mess up,  for example there seared ahi tuna dish was a disaster, but there grilled chicken sandwich was good.  Anything on the menu over $15 stay away from.   I most likely will not return unless I hear that they have consolidated there menu and changed the flavor profile to most of there dishes.

The chicken was bbq'd a bit too much, being a little bit drier than I prefered, but it was slathered in what tasted like a satay sauce from a can. No joke, I think I have the same kung lee or whatever brand of satay dressing in my fridge right now. I would pass on the chicken satay. The soup came out looking nice. there were big slices of chicken, onions, and a single slice of tomato. The onions were all under cooked and a bit sharp, maybe this was their intent, but they were cut too large so it wasn't an easy task to align it with the spoon direction to be able to fit it in my mouth with the soup (that's what she said, freak). The soup also had a bit of a sour taste, not exactly to my liking either.\n\nThe entree came in a small bowl, cause it's a soupy curry, with a bowl shaped mound of rice.

Um.. all i could say was that the curry had salt, a bit too much. I think the chef mixed the ingredients up, instead of sugar he added salt. Instead of curry powder, salt! Salt salt salt! I had to dump all the rice in to soak up the curry and balance out the flavor to make it more palatable.

This place rocks! Pride of Indianapolis!\n\nI just visited Indianapolis for the first time today and searched Yelp for a good coffee joint. Milktooth popped up with a good number of reviews so I decided to check it out. Milktooth is near downtown Indianapolis but it's on the outskirt so street parking was easy to find but they have their own parking lot too. In the parking lot is a little garden which kind of hints at what they believe in as far as food source.  \n\nThere is a patio outdoors for eating in the open. Indoors is an urban modern industrial environment which is a new trend in restaurant design. There are tables and bar seating. Behind the counter if the bar area is where the chefs cook up their creations in front of the diners which is neat to watch.  This cooking in the open also lets diners know they are eating clean food and no tricks are pulled behind the kitchen.  \n\nI started with a Pistachio Cream iced coffee which is a mixed drink with espresso, honey, cardamom, pistachio cream, and an orange peel for garnish. The drink was a homerun! I can totally taste all the different flavors in it and it was an incredible experience.  Each tasting note was very distinct and arrived at different times from the start of the sip to the swallow and the aftertaste. Unfortunately this drink is super small and expensive for a coffee at 5.50. Please increase the size of the drink or lower the price a little!\n\nNext I had a dutch baby pancake with sweet lemon mango curd, kiwi, and cashews. This dish was awesome and definitely a good change from the typical american pancakes. The pancake itself had much more flavor than the typical american pancake. The edges had a nice crust for a change in texture. The lemon mango curd had just the right amount of sweetness that would satisfy diners who are not into overly sweet foods like donuts or junk food. The lemon mango curd had a little bit of tanginess in it that lets you know lemon is in it. The kiwi and cashews also complement the dish well. I enjoyed every bite. \n\nFinally I finished with a mocha. Although the drink may sound simple like a drink you can get at any coffee joint, Milktooth's rendition of the Mocha is unquestionable different, delectable in taste, and visually stunning in appearance. The barista's milk froth art is a work of brilliance like the mona lisa. You have not seen latte art until you've seen Milktooth's latte art. The details in the picture, swirls, lines, and patterns are very intricate and the colors are amazing in contrast. This drink looks too good to drink so i stared and oggled it for quite some time before I took a sip. The artwork remained im form for quite awhile even as I drank away to half the cup and it only lost its image when I was about 90% done. \n\nWell done Milktooth!!  This is a must visit place and a shining star in the city.

I did enjoy the non-charred bits of lobster and my steak, which was succulent, juicy and hiding a hint of sweetness (although a bit more pepper/rub would've been great) whereas SO thoroughly enjoyed his porterhouse (both sides bringing out separate textures, the bone adding in a caramelized tone of flavor)\nOVER his steak- SO took Erica's suggestion and got the truffle butter- definitely made his meal. If you're on the fence, GO FOR IT. You won't be disappointed!\nSIDE DISH: we opted for the creamed spinach which was another excellent suggestion by Erica. Unlike other places where the spinach is too rich that you're feeling icky after the 3rd or 4th bite, Morton's had hints of nutmeg but was made so that you didn't feel too heavy afterwards. Definitely a good accompaniment to our meal\nDESSERT: Thinking we were too full afterwards but unable to say no after Erica wheeled out the sweet choices, SO and I split a carrot cake. Absolutely the right choice! It's rich with carrot shavings on the side, a tall 2 layer separated by cream, made right. SO and I fought for bites and I took it to the next level, washing it down with a Kahlua/coffee.\n\nThe eh:\nLobster bisque- don't get me wrong, it's tasty but felt like it was missing something.

If this was a normal restaurant that charged $15 -$20 for a simple Chicken Dinner I would still expect it to be prepared correctly or fixed but $26 for a simple Chicken Dish with mashed potatoes and some greens was quite high in cost IMO...but I understand the overhead in Montecito garners these prices...but really,, dry and tough,,no attempt to make it better.  \n\nTwo of us had empty wine glasses and once again had to track down the water for a refill.  \n\nI liked this restaurant in the past and hate to grade it based on one dinner but the attitude of both the waiter and manager was unacceptable and almost like they were upset that we had to mention anything to them.\n\nDoubt I will go and spend another $150 + tip for three people to have two glasses of wine each , two simple pasta dishes and one basic Chicken dish.", "date": "2017-07-28 19:28:24"}, {"_key": "49268", "_id": "reviews/49268", "_rev": "_fNyp8Ou--l", "review_id": "uSCuwb2HwzYIEjxLOSji_Q", "user_id": "dgMe18c7zU5jk4TwSmIzVA", "business_id": "GBTPC53ZrG1ZBY3DT8Mbcw", "stars": 5, "useful": 7, "funny": 2, "cool": 4, "text": "Thanks George M. for recommending this place!! and also the reviews of my Yelper friends!

We arrived a little early so we sat at the bar. I wanted to stick to a rum drink since that was what I had earlier that afternoon. So the bartender made me a special hurricane with fresh fruit. The bar area is really nice. The place is really nice and d\u00e9cor is very warm and classy. \n\nWe were starving so right off the bat we ordered a salad with fried oyster, bacon, romaine & avocado salad. OMG I am not a fan of oysters but fried oysters are amazing! especially in a fresh delicious salad. I had a cup of crab & corn bisque and I wish I had ordered a bowl instead. It was so warm and the flavor of crab and corn are great together. By this time we were so excited to order our entr\u00e9es. \n\nSince I LOVE mussels I had to order Moules ET frites- this was mussels steamed with garlic & thyme (AMAZING) with house-made fries. I was afraid I would not be full but they loaded me up with mussels. My fianc\u00e9 ordered Jumbo Louisiana shrimp \"en cocotte\" roasted jalape\u00f1o cheese grits, andouille & green onion sausages and of course I had to steal a little. It was made to perfection. \n\nI think by far this was one of the best places we visited in N.O. They made my top list. If you are ever in the area make sure you stop by. I heard happy hour is great here. \n\nOur waiter was very attentive and super cool even though we accidently dropped a drink. We were a little embarrassed but he made us feel comfortable.

The sauce was very spicy and flavorful, but I agree with others that it was salty even considering that Sichuan cuisine tends to be heavily seasoned.  Most restaurants use cheaper long grain rice, but here they used starchier short grain rice that Chinese, Korean, and Japanese prefer because sticky short grain rice pick up sauce better than hard fluffy long grain rice.   \n\nI spotted a pan of kou shui ji next to a line of ubiquitous looking stir fries.  I can't help it but get a small box to go.  Kou shui ji literally translates to salivating chicken, so good, you'll salivate thinking about it.

Chip's pork chop was a spectacle of gristle and fat.  Despite its huge size he probably got about a half portion due to the bad cut of meat.  His potatoes were pretty good.

I've been watching it rise from the ground for the last couple of years and was thrilled to finally have it be open and willing to accept my corproate rate!  \n\nI did the self park on this occasion - no issues there for the majority of the time.  There was one big convention for a few days where parking was a major issue and they had people directing traffic out front and in the garage.  Hopefully, they'll be better prepared for similar events in the future - it was really frustrating to take 15 minutes to get parked after coming back from a long day of class.\n\nAnyway, the check in process was smooth and it seems to be a thing at this hotel to walk guests to the right elevators.  Pretty slick...the elevators were problematic a time or two (not working correctly), but I kind of chalk that up to new hotel bugs. \n\nThe whole feel of the hotel is kind of natural modern...kind of a midwestern twist on scandanavian design.  Lots of wood and organic items around the hotel.  Very comfortable, very lovely.\n\nThe room was great - I was put in a nice room on the concierge level.  Huge space, great furniture, comfortable bed, no issues with the internet and a really over the top shower with multiple spray heads, etc.  Judging by the photos below, I think the rooms on the concierge level might be a little bigger than the standard rooms...but, it's good to have Marriott Status! \n\nThe concierge lounge was fabulous.  Awesome selection of food in the evening - you could just about have dinner up here - 4 or 5 various salads each night in addition to the normal heavier goodies.  The breakfast was fairly standard and theall day snacks (local gourmet popcorn while I was there) was tasty!\n\nThe gym was well stocked for a hotel facility.  Lots of equipment and a really great variety as well.  Love that the cardio machines overlook the city - makes the workouts go by much more quickly.

So, liquor bar it truly is, but amazing food it definitely has.\n\nBut: the bites are pretty killer, from what I experienced. For what they seemingly lack in a way of app and entree selection they more than make up for with the quality, care, and innovation of their offerings.\n\nI landed after a long day of travel, famished. My lovely host, Brit S, picked me up from the airport, and after situating myself at the Conrad, we hopped the whole two blocks over to the Libertine.\n\n(It should be noted that former Indy CM Jon A also highly suggested checking this place out.)\n\nThe space is long and lean, with a formidable bar set-up and bottles for days behind the bar. Bitters and fruit and tinctures and all that, you know the drill at this point. The \"kitchen\" is also behind the bar, and the whole thing is grey and low light and trees/antlers and candlelight and warm and really nice smells. It sort of reminded me of a less formal Hinterland (located in MKE). Employees rock the whole Stumptown coffee look, but they're not nearly as in yr face with it as Stumptown is.\n\nOh, yeah. I was telling a mildly entertaining story with linear progression, wasn't I? \n\nSo: I was *famished,* and wanted nothing more than to start w/ one of their amazing cocktails, but knew I needed to put something in that stomach of mine first.\n\nSo... to the eats.\n\n1. A beet salad starter which Brit and I shared. Goat cheese and spinach and beets and yup, you guessed it. So so good, as beet salads can be when they're done right. Then?\n\n2. A chanterelle mushroom & fresh vegetable pot pie. Oh my god, I can't even. I love chanterelles, I love pot pies (secret favorite thing), so... you get the idea. Clearly handmade with fresh ingredients, I couldn't stop eating it. It was effing delicious. I was full, and yet, I kept eating. So so good.\n\nThe rest of the bites on the menu were on that whole gastro tip with an emphasis on the more foodie-focused. (God, I still hate the word foodie. I really do.) What I mean? I don't remember seeing offal or brains, but along those lines for sure. Marrow, elk, etc.\n\nAnyways, moving on (and this is important). To the cocktail: our very attentive/sweet server and I talked through a myriad of offerings and possibilities, and after much ado about bourbon, we settled on a variation of Seelbach with a locally aged bourbon.

Our guide had the perfect mix of wry humor, interesting facts and amusing stories. Furthermore, he was clearly passionate about what he did and loved his city, so he didn't sound like he was reciting a rehearsed script. The tour itself takes you through some beautiful passages within Honey Island Swamp. Those silver, hanging Spanish moss curtains you see in pictures? They're real. In person, they are so utterly beautiful that I would actually recommend you tour the swamps in the winter than in warmer seasons. You may not see as much wildlife (although we still managed to see (and handle) a baby alligator, 2 snakes, 4 turtles, 1 magnificent blue heron, a beaver-like creature, and a mama wild boar with her 2 piglets who swam out to our boat for 20 mins feasting on the marshmallows our guide threw), but there is no foliage to mar the beauty of all that silver.\n\nThe Plantation Tour was much less impressive. Not so much for the plantations or the guides, but rather that it was very poorly planned. We were given far too much time at Laura Plantation (about 3 hours) and far too little time at Oak Alley (about 1 hour total from disembarking to re-boarding). Personally, I was completely unimpressed with our guide at Laura (who for some reason pronounces \"archives\" with a hard \"ch\" like the herb), and do not understand why people rave about the tour here. I was ready to leave halfway through. Oak Alley on the other hand is just as majestic and beautiful in person as it is in all the postcards, and the tour guides are far more captivating.

Who doesn't want to experience Reveillon when they're in NOLA?\n\nThere's a lot that's good about this restaurant. There's also a lot that isn't quite up to par.\n\nPros:\n- Happy Hour: 50-cent oysters? Pretty sure I died and went to heaven. And they were huge, succulent, deliciously briny Gulf Coast oysters! Some were easily twice the size of normal oysters\n- Delicious cocktails: Seeing as they were half off because of HH, I indulged and got both the Champagne au Peche (Champagne and fresh peach puree) and the St. Charles Streetcar (St. Germain, pear vodka, Champagne). Both were tasty and refreshing\n\nCons:\n- The Reveillon menu left a lot to be desired. For the first course, my boyfriend got the shrimp remoulade and I got the crispy sweetbread with beluga lentils and blood orange brown butter vinaigrette. The remoulade was flavorless and forgettable. The sweetbread was actually well-cooked (very crisp) but got to be too rich after a while.\n- The turtle soup and seafood gumbo that made up our second course were both terrible. There was maybe a kernel of turtle meat in the entire bowl of soup and the gumbo lacked seasoning. Our third course consisted of crispy flounder stuffed with crab, shrimp and mirliton dressing, and a rib roast with oyster dressing, turnip and apple puree, and cherry compote. - \n- The roast was decent if a bit chewy, but the flounder was so rich that my boyfriend couldn't finish it. \n- Our final course was dessert--bread pudding with vanilla ice-cream and hot buttered pecan sauce for him, apple tart with caramel and praline ice-cream for me. The praline ice-cream was great, but the bread pudding was too sweet in my opinion and the apple tart was virtually inedible on account of being too dry.\n- Service was also disappointing for a restaurant with this reputation. Our server was nice enough, but she would disappear for long blocks of time during inopportune moments when we really needed her\n\nAll in all, I'm glad I did a Reveillon dinner in NOLA, but I don't think I'll be recommending Luke to anyone.", "date": "2013-01-03 07:22:07"}, {"_key": "126516", "_id": "reviews/126516", "_rev": "_fNyp7n2--o", "review_id": "iJaxQU0CPFin0Vcf-uperw", "user_id": "WS8qhWFqToquV40vYOospg", "business_id": "MfyUK58sdUokMdIZNdem0w", "stars": 2, "useful": 4, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "My fianc\u00e9 idea to stay here again! #Grrr any who, he booked a standard room but for some reason or another, we were upgraded to the hotel suite, I was like \"well alrite!?

OK this is a Friday night around 8pm and they are out of brisket and dry rub ribs already????  \nTo add to the situation ,my friends pulled pork was not good it was dry, any sauce we applied on the pork was like it repelled it. \nOn the slight plus side the few dry ribs I did get were decent as was the baked sweet potato,\nunfortunately I can't say the same for the Mac and cheese which rivaled the Kraft variety.\nThe only shining light here was our server who was very friendly,attentive and apologetic to the situation. \nI would not go back here , there are much better BBQ options in the area that execute it much better and don't run out of key menu items on a Friday night.", "date": "2013-01-05 06:27:57"}, {"_key": "29174", "_id": "reviews/29174", "_rev": "_fNyp7rm--X", "review_id": "bFIhWDQxwL7tovWRLMcA3A", "user_id": "x7UU1bdc2INFrZFwp6yOPw", "business_id": "BAcfjCEhizeH5Uh_TBq1_A", "stars": 5, "useful": 7, "funny": 3, "cool": 3, "text": "I have tried all the big named and $$$ dry cleaners around the Carrollwood area and this small place outshines them all.

Sushi is a totally new concept for Tampa. It's conveyor-belt sushi also known as kaiten-sushi or kaiten-zushi or sushi-go-round in Japan. You sit at a booth and grab the sushi you want and pay at the end.\n\nMy first experience with this kind of sushi was in San Francisco when I first tried sushi as a 5-year old at Isobune Sushi in Japantown and I have longed for a conveyor-belt style sushi place to come to Tampa since I moved here in 1999. Yo! Sushi is finally making that a reality.\n\nThe style of Yo! Sushi is modern and different from Isobune. The focus is on fast, fresh, and convenient and the setup of the place follows this focus. When you walk-up to the restaurant it's open and easy to get a seat at. Call-buttons are placed at each table to make it easy to get service and close your check.\n\nSushi is constantly being rolled and made by the sushi chefs at the restaurant and the open-kitchen let's you watch the chefs in action. I have faith a high-traffic area like the International Plaza will help ensure the freshness of the fish at Yo! Sushi. \n\nPlates range from $3-$6 and contain a variety of cooked and raw sushi, cooked Japanese food, and dessert. There's a little bit of something for everyone depending on your tastes. \n\nOne of my favorite things I have tried so far is the Chicken Katsu Curry which comes a small plate with rice below and about 5 cuts of katsu for $5. I often want to order katsu at restaurants, but find it hard to justify spending $15 on dinner for one - especially when I also want sushi with my food and end up just ditching the katsu. This meets me halfway.\n\nAs far as the sushi is concerned - it tastes fresh and is certainly above what you would find at a buffet or something like Koizi/Saki Endless Sushi. It's not quite the highest quality of sushi which is understandable considering the price and focus, but still satisfactory to me for the taste. Most of the sushi leans towards salmon, tuna, and imitation crab/crab special or California Roll-creations. \n\nI also liked the Popcorn Shrimp (tastes more like Bang Bang Shrimp), Takoyaki (hard to find a decent one in Tampa for sure!), and the Kimchi Salmon Steamed Bun (bun was just right and salmon pretty good quality!). There are plenty of things to try though so repeat visits will need to be made!\n\nFor me, Yo! Sushi is great for a quick and tasty meal when I'm in a rush and don't necessarily want to spend as much time/money at a regular Japanese sushi restaurant. I can see how someone who wants a really high-end Japanese experience may not approve, but then one should also consider price and time into factors of that justification.\n\nThe service is friendly/approachable and the managers clearly really love working for Yo! Sushi which is something plenty of restaurants in Tampa Bay seem to lack and may come from them being an international company.\n\nDefinitely check it out even if it's just to try something new for fun with some friends or family.

In retrospect, I should have been overjoyed, because I would have had an excellent excuse to post up in the dingy (charming?) dining room and eat so many shrimp tacos I couldn't breath. It would have been worth it, because they're awesome. \n\nDuring dinner, $8.00 and tax gets you three tacos of your choice, beans, rice, pickled onions and radishes, limes, and a 16 oz. cup of fresh juicy heaven. I went with shrimp, my husband mixed it up with fish and shrimp. Lemme break it down: \n\nTortillas: Fresh, handmade, substantial without being dense. Impossibly moist and flexible. How are these not crumbling apart in my hand? This is a tortilla that can stand up to some serious manhandling, which is exactly what I did to my tacos. I would like to note that I would manhandle these on their own as a snack, or filled with cheese and green chiles. \n\nShrimp: Crispy until the end. Moderately battered. I won't say lightly - someone's dragging these through the batter with a heavyish hand, but I'm happy to say they're cooked perfectly and thoroughly enough that you don't encounter any flavorless globs of doughy disappointment. Just pure, deep fried ecstasy. \n\nSauce: White sauce of indeterminable origin. Mayonnaise? Vinegar? Crema? DELICIOUS. Cooly, tangy, and sour in the best way possible. Really the great unifier - bringing together while still accentuating the hot, crispy, shrimp, crunchy cabbage, and dense corn tortilla. \n\nBeans & Rice: Solid. Substantial. You're going to eat them. \n\nHorchata: Dude said people show up just for the horchata and I believe him. This doesn't come out of a fountain, and I'm not just saying that because I watched as it got ladled out of some giant tub resting on the counter top. You can taste the rice. This drink has texture, and what appears to be giant, lovely flecks of cinnamon bark. \n\nPina/Mango Juice: Fortifying. So tasty. Chunks of fresh pineapple.

I have used this service a few times and it's nice not to have to pay for parking and be dropped off at the front door of Scottrade. \n\nThey also have Karaoke on Friday and Saturday nights which is always a fun time. Great happy hour specials and nightly specials except for Saturdays are also a huge plus! The only negative I can think of is that parking is a pain due to it being in a hotel. \n\nThey had a huge post St. Pat's parade celebration where they had the local band \"Joe Dirt\" playing in the parking lot.

They have a huge list of $6 apps and flat breads, $3 domestic drafts, $4 mixed drinks, and $5 glasses of house wine. Not a bad deal! The southern nachos were AWESOME! So messy but oh so good! The roasted veggie flat bread was really salty so I do not recommend that. \n\nThe highlight of our visit was the gooey butter cake martini. Holy hell I could have drank these until I was sick. It is literally gooey butter cake with alcohol in a glass. You MUST try it. I ordered one then everyone at the table tried it and ordered their own. It's that good and totally worth the price and the calories!\n\nThe atmosphere in the bar area reminds me of a classy sports bar. It is also huge with plenty of seating options and a large center bar. This would be a great place to catch a game and enjoy great drinks and food as they have TONS of TVs and at least one, maybe two gigantic projection screens. \n\nThe only complaint I have was the service. It was slow and she was kinda rude, but nothing to stop me from coming back. \n\nI'll see ya soon BlackFinn.

I will drink it over any other beer nowadays. However, Schlafly Bottleworks has a couple minor details to work on. \n\nCons\n \n- No wait service in the bar area. You must go to the bar to order everything and the 1 food runner/buser was not good at all about coming and cleaning off dirty dishes from the tables. I carried most of our dirty plates away myself b/c we ran out of room on the table. Yuck! Let's work on the service aspect guys.\n\n- The food is not that great. I would give the food 2.5 stars after multiple visits. \n\nPros \n\n- Awesome atmosphere. The bartender got up and sang a song with the band. Pretty laid back and friendly all around. \n\n- Kick ass, huge patio/beer garden in the summer, and they have live bands out there too. Always a fun time! \n\n- They host multiple beer festivals throughout the year.\n\n- Obviously, fantastic locally made micro brews. Pumpkin Ale, Oktoberfest, and Summer lager seasonals are my favorites!\n\nOverall, I LOVE SCHLAFLY.

In my mind, there is no such thing as 'overly' competitive but as an example; I once threatened to take on a pair of over 6ft tall twin dudes when they were cheating in beer pong. (I was serious about fighting them too). Anyway, what does this have to do with a fancy-smancy bowling alley? Well, Fulton Alley is a lovely place to be all fancy and drink fancy drinks and bowl. But who do you go to fancy places with? Normally people you are trying to impress or at least not make them think that you are a crazy person. So Fulton Alley is tough for this girl. I had a great time at our Yelp Bowling tournament but that maybe one of the few times I will be bowling at Fulton Alley. I have been here late on a Saturday and it was nice but I was happy just to enjoy (many) craft cocktails. The bartenders here are really great. They are friendly, attentive, and know how to make a damn fine drink. Ok, so overall Fulton Alley is very nice for fancy-pants things. However, this is not Gloucester bowling alley and throwing a fit and flicking off the pins will not win you any points.", "date": "2014-04-23 17:32:56"}]
