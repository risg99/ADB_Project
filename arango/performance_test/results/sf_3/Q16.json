We came on a Friday afternoon before St. Patrick's Day, and was it packed outside. There was a group of maybe 10 waiting and other groups of 2-4 waiting on the street. The hostess was very polite and helpful, but we ended up waiting close to 1.5-2 hours for a table of 3. \n\nThe decor of the place gives the similar vibe when you arrive - it feels very homey and welcome. The staff was a bit slower with service and not too attentivie to me patiently waiting to put our order down or get the check - understandable since it's so busy, but can still be improved. I had the crab meat omelette and it was alright at best, but not worth the wait or the price. My friend liked his bananas foster french toast, so possibly I should have ordered the other recommended items.\n\nWhat really made this experince a 2 star as opposed to a 3 star was the staff messed up our check. We waited 10 minutes to finally get their attention to send the check over, only to have the bill twice the actual price. I'm pretty certain the check was meant for the table of 5 next to us, so I'm sure they were happy getting a $35 bill. There wasn't really a sense of urgency in getting the check out of the way, which might have explained the extremely long wait to get into the restaurant. \n\nMaybe we came on a bad day, maybe I ordered the wrong item, and maybe the waiter was new.

The service and food quality can be top notch.\n\nOrdering take out is another experience altogether.\n\nSure ordering for pickup automatically excludes us from getting a level of service that is often expected from a Montecito restaurant but we didn't realize that ordering takeout also meant that we would be subject to huge swings of food quality/consistency. After all isn't food quality the one thing that a restaurant can exhibit huge amounts of control over?\n\nThe latest takeout experience involved ordering Garganelli with chicken and mushrooms. One order excluded the chicken and the other order assumed that we would enjoy having the chicken added as an after thought - on top of the dish as if it were an over easy egg. We have pictures of the incredibly appetizing meal (being facetious of course) but there doesn't appear to be a way to post those while writing this review. Keep in mind the cost of the meal is the same for takeout or dine in.  The same price applies even when no chicken or mushrooms are added.\n\nOur advice - don't order takeout at Tre Lune.  If you are in pinch and find yourself looking over the menu, then place your order and clear your calendar just in case you need to stick around the restaurant while your dish is being remade the correct way.\n\nPS. And no, these are not the only examples.  There are others but clearly we didn't learn our lesson and continued ordering.

Our server took our food orders first since we all still had drinks at that time. Around 10 we didn't have any food yet, and it started to rain so we quickly moved inside. They had a large table available that was able to fit all but 3 of us. So we just stood for about 15 Mins until I finally asked our server if they intended to bring us chairs so we could sit when our food came. They brought us seats and we squeezed in at the table. At 10:20 one of our guests asked the server for a drink refill - because in the 55 minutes she had been our server, she never ONCE asked if we wanted more drinks!! She took her order and started to walk away! I waved her back and said, I think our whole table would like to order drinks. Our appetizers were finally served at 10:25. An hour after we had been seated. Our drinks didn't come until 10:40... 20 Mins after we ordered them. Our dinner was not served until 11:05! Then those of us with skirt steak had the smallest little portions, and it was drowning in oil and butter. We only had a few bites because it was so oily. So... bachelorette party. Two hours for late night dinner service. Server only got us one round of drinks more than an hour after we sat down... completely killed the mood of the party! We had been at Tastings beforehand and had the most amazing service, incredible fun, and Livery brought the whole night down. We had 13 people to start... only 4 ended up continuing the party.

The menu states The entrees come with  piccata potatoes and sauteed veggies. The bread was still doughy. \n\nWhen the food was sent back, the waitress stated the \"chef\" would be out to talk to us. The waitress then returned a few moments later and stated we will cut the bill in half. The \"chef\" never talked to us.  We then asked what happened to the \"chef\" that trained in Italy. The waitress stated he relocated to Nashville a few months ago; however, the current cook still uses the same recipes. \n\nWe asked about the grated parmesan cheese, mozzarella cheese, and the noodles. Was told they don't use fresh parmesean because it would go bad. They also don't make their own mozzarella or noodles even though the website says differently. Was a horrible experience and definitely over priced. There was only one other table of people there the entire time we dined. I don't recommend it at all. We will hunt for another Italian restaurant.  \n\nOn a positive note the salad was very good.

Twice I was told \"sorry we ran out of steel cut oats\". \nThe silver dollar pancakes and scrambled eggs are just ok, wouldn't come back for that either. \nThey had some oatmeal chocolate chip cookies which were really good but again overpriced. \nCoffee was ok, nothing special but I have to say that they do serve organic half and half and organic almond milk. \nView is great, nice outdoor seating and very pleasant space inside. But... service is terrible. They seem like they have no idea what they're doing. Everyone is doing everything-from taking orders to cooking to serving. It seemed very chaotic. I waited the other morning for 15 mins just to order-even though I was first in line because the guy was making smoothies and explained the older lady what she should be doing. She was munching on the dates while making smoothies, not wearing gloves and one of the guys who was supposed to do all the cooking (I guess) was taking orders using the same glove for handling credit cards that he uses for preparing food...The two guys also seemed a bit annoyed and unpleasant-probably because they cannot handle that many customers... \nAll in all-menu looks interesting and different but the food my group had was just ok.

I explained the we tried to call in order to avoid wasting time, bus and cab fare back since it was late.  The hostess apologized and stated that the restaurant is really busy. I understand that, but what is unsettling is the patrons waiting outside also made several phone calls and when they finally did get through they were told that they don't accept reservations over the phone.

I totally understand policy and being cautious of underage drinking, but she was so unprofessional and rude about it. Finally she says she'll look into it and takes it into the back. \n\nSo five minutes later she takes it into the back and asks to see my credit card, and compares my ID with my credit card.

As if they'd been sitting a minute. The conch fritters were good, well seasoned and the sauce added great balance.\n\nWe finished up and what I'm assuming was a service manager or floor manager came by with our second course... mind you we had not been cleared or re-silvered from our first course. Instead of turning around and clearing us before dropping food, he simply dropped the courses and walked away.. coming back after a few minutes to clear the dirty plates and drop new share plates. \n\nOur second courses were the gulf shrimp with Calabrian Chile's which were tasty, and a very good dish... the tuna tartar on the other hand was again extremely salty, maybe due to seasoning before considering that salty tobiko/caviar of some type was going on top which made the dish almost inedible. \n\nThis time our plates were cleared and we did get re silvered. For our entrees we ordered the \"acclaimed\" curry goat and the red fish dish.\n\nNeither dish wowed me. The fish was one dimensional, there was no textural contrast in the dish. The sauce, the fish, the garnish, was all soft, room temp, and this time extremely under seasoned. It was lacking some sort of acidity and crunch to wake it up. The goat was under seasoned as well and lacking depth. Though the gnocchi was very well cooked and made it was not enough to save the dish. The sad thing is, even though our distaste was apparent, the server made no inquire as to why we hadn't eaten our entrees. no manager came to check on us, it seemed as though the staff was just floating through their night. \n\nI expected a lot more from the service and food for a restaurant as widely acclaimed as this one is.

My aunt has a mushroom and shrimp food allergy but the server proceeded to give her a soup full of mushroom flakes anyway. Once the chef began preparing our food, we did not see our server again... she didn't stop by to check on our needs and even the chef was looking around for her. All of our cups were empty and in need of a refill, so I had to get up from my seat and search around for our waiter to inform her that we needed refills. She exclaimed that she had other tables to tend to... which is fine but she never returned to check on us. I'm not sure if her customer service skills sucked because she knew gratuity was included regardless if she works or not, but thanks to her we will choose a different habachi restaurant in the future. Oh, and to put the cherry on top, my husband wanted a to-go water, since we had a 1 hour drive home, and of course our server was absent after we paid, so I proceeded to ask another server near the sushi bar, and he and his coworkers laughed right in my face and told me to ask my server... at this moment I was disgusted knowing I gave these people our hard earned money.

The meals finally arrived..I must say the French fries were fabulous! The chicken a bit dry but edible with a smear of the mayo! My husbands piece of fish looked like a beached whale and when he cut into it out came runny oil all over the place with fish that was gray in color. It looked like blubber!! I asked a server to get the manager as we were disgusted already and now this.  She said oh I will get you the manager( she will probably comp you a free dessert???Really..that is going to make a wrong right? Manager comes over after a problem at the next booth and says \"Oh I'm terribly sorry\" I must find out what the problem is in the kitchen. Very surprised about your fish and chips cause it is a favorite of everyone. She came back totally walking past us not explaining at all but walks behind the bar and stood talking. Jeff the server comes over and says pick a free dessert..seriously???? The bill came and evidently took off the platter of fish but never came back.

Upon walking in they gave no notification that they were running behind so I sat down not realizing that most of the people sitting at the nail stations had not been helped. Once the tech approached me to do my nails she took my polish off then someone walked in wanting a wax done so she stopped helping me to go do the wax. At this point I seriously thought about and should have just walked out but I stayed at which point another nail tech, a man this time came to start the process of doing my nails. I brought my own polish which was a glitter polish which I know was see through with blue and silver flecks of glitter because this was what I wanted.

Take my recommendation and DO NOT hire United Van Lines to move you. By far the worst company me & my wife have ever experienced in our entire lives. Our overall move experience was a COMPLETE NIGHTMARE. From start to finish our relocation was extremely poorly handled by United Van Lines. Being guaranteed during our quote that if we signed with United Van Lines they would have our belongings loaded and arrived at our new location by 8-1-17. After numerous interactions with the moving coordinator and being lied to about the status of our property, our belongings weren't delivered until 8-11-17 and 8-14-17 due to additional loads being added and our stuff being split into two separate trucks without our approval. I drove from MN to AZ and incurred multiple moving expenses due to the lies about when the truck was leaving MN with our property. Given these multiple delays we notified United Van Lines we would not be at our new house to receive the first truck due to a family wedding we were in. United Van Lines then wanted us to pay additional money to have it stored overnight for all of their mistakes & incompetence. In a new city where we know nobody we made arrangements to fly someone down to AZ to be present while the first truck was unloaded while we flew back to MN. Obviously even more unnecessary costs incurred because of United Van Lines . United Van Lines is responsible for numerous damaged items as well as 9 lost boxes that are irreplaceable. This kind of service is absolutely ridiculous especially coming from the largest moving company in the entire country. To add the cherry on top our claims process has been equally miserable as the move itself. We submitted our claim on 9-26-17 and did not receive the claim check until 2-17-18 to replace all of the property that was damaged & lost by United Van Lines. The claims coordinator for United Van Lines never kept us in the loop as to our claims status, we always had to initiate the conversation and even then were lied to about its status as they continually told us a new date to expect reimbursement. United Van Lines should be embarrassed with their customer service during our move as this process is inexcusable and no doubt the worst service we've ever experienced. I will NEVER recommend this company to anyone looking for a successful & easy move. Rest assured my letter to the Betterbusinessbureau will say this exact same thing about United Van Lines.

I simply asked \"if entry fee needed to be paid if we arrive prior to 3:00p.m.\" (the ad stated $10 entry for an event at 3:00p.m.) The employee responded \"no ma'am, wrist bands could be picked up upon entry\" Upon arrival I was told if we didn't pay $25 each we wouldn't be allowed to stay for the event and to enter it would be $10  to stay until 6:00p.m. even though it was 1:15p.m. I explained the situation about my email correspondence and the employee (Devone) stated if we had gotten there at 1:00p.m. we could have gained free entry. Confused and wanting to obtain a correct answer I went inside to speak to a manager. Kenneth at the front desk met us with an immediate rude demeanor. When I explained why id like to speak to a manger he snatched my phone with the emailed on it stated \"The manager won't want to come out to see this email I need to take it back to \"her.\" He returned stating the person who emailed me assumed I was staying the night at the hotel and not just a customer of the restaurant. I reaffirmed and pointed out in the email I never stating that I was staying the night at the hotel and would like to speak to manager about this issue since we are paying customers of restaurant and have visited this establishment many times. Kenneth stated entry is NEVER free at ANY TIME and that I was lying about the previous time I gained free entry. He refused to ask the manager to come out and speak to me because determined my issue insignificant to their business. If proper information was given we would have gotten there before 1, or paid the $40 in advance, but based on misinformation we were charged $100 with not so much as a sorry for the misundertsanding.

The salad I got today though was awful. The chicken was, in my opinion, undercooked and cold, and certainly not blackened. The salad itself was drowning in dressing and the croutons are bland and leave a bad taste in your mouth. To top it off, the salad by itself is $12 or $13, if you add chicken it's $16.

I'm not sure if I'm able to fully judge the desert, I got a curated chocolate flavored cone that was supposed to come with chocolate ice cream, chocolate cake, and chocolate ganache. There was no ganache in or on the cone, which probably would have helped overall. \n\nThe dessert is sold in a cheap, fragile clear plastic cone. I suppose this is for Instagram users, but I would assume most of these people would be concerned about the massive amount of garbage this is creating, for no benefit other than AESTHETIC. This aesthetic would be served better by serving the dessert in a glass reusable container that doesn't crack in your hand under a slight bit of pressure. \n\nThis establishment would do well to invent something portable, cheap and delicious to house the dessert if they don't want to use glass. I'm imagining maybe throwing waffle batter in a really flat griddle, made fresh for the customer, and rolling it into a cone shape while it's still malleable.

We have never been here so we wanted to test thing out, but why does that matter?? Moving on, the appertizers were good so we decided to stay for dinner, drinks were not bad so we order a second round. Ok, here the next interesting part, so we ask about the Lamb course and she turn up the attitude, saying \"I don't eat LAMB!!\" Oh... OK...? So now we know you don't eat LAMB thanks so very much for letting us know your preference. Should I apologized for asking, I mean it's on the menu! But the last time I check I didn't ask Do you eat LAMB? Did I miss waitress? You have Lamb on the menu so it's your job to explain the dish to your customer and not put your own opinion and feeling on my dinner. We didn't ask you to. Thanks!! So when she said she didn't eat Lamb with chucks full of attitude and judgement on us as meat eater. Oh, no how dare us??!!! I told her we eat them all!! She turned and gave me a silent side stare/glare.

It was terrible! Overly salty and covered in lettuce. The rye bread was by far the best part. The turkey club was equally as bad. The turkey was beyond dry and the bacon wasn't very fresh. You could tell it was reheated, it was chewy but rock hard. The Italian hoagie flat out tasted funny. The meat was cut super thick and it was also very slimy. The hoagie lacked seasoning but it was covered in onions. Due to the taste and look of it we trashed it. The pierogis were easily forgettable. They were your typical stuff and not very good. They turkey special, again the turkey was dry. The thousand island was good but again something out of a jar, cole slaw was the same. All\nOf the sandwiches are large but that's not always good.

I was introduced to Tijuana Flats in 2001 and will go out of my way (as I did today) when the craving hits me.  I came in today for Tijuana Tuesdaze and ordered an extra taco.  I went to the hot sauce bar and before I could finish picking my hot sauces the food came out...it was almost like it came out of the Star Trek food replicators it was so fast.  It was also well below the Mendoza line.  I'm being nice by saying that the food was barely warm.  The flavor was also off.  I don't know if it was a change in the taco seasoning or a lack of seasonong altogether...but it was mediocre.  I felt like a ate a mismade order that was for someone else before me.  This part is bad enough in itself, but there is more.  I come here for the hot sauce bar.  Tijuana Flats is all about the hot sauce, and so am I.  I am particularly a fan of the tear jerker grade sauce.  Guess what?  There weren't any tear jerker sauces on the bar today...instead there was a sauce pump that was dedicated to Heinz Ketchup.  WTF?  Your offerings are in an area clearly labeled HOT BAR.  Get that fucking ketchup off of there and give me what I have been coming for for the last 17 years.  For real...if you're working your way through an identity crisis then put the red plastic Heinz squeeze bottles on the table and quit shitting on your branding.  For the 1st time ever, I left Tijuana Flats completely underwhelmed.  I come here to eat a good quality scratch taco and burn my god damn face off...which you guys are normally damn good at.  Leave the cheeseburger flavored taco to the choke n puke flavored cardboard menu at Taco Bell.

These doors would work great for that!\" and then she said that she would look into how much the doors weighed and what hardware to use and would get back to me. \n\nA couple of days went by and I didn't hear back. So, I called again. She wasn't there, but the gentleman on the phone was happy to talk to me about my project. He said \"NO! You absolutely should not use these doors as bifold doors because they are too heavy. They'll look alright to start, but they will sag over time. You should do floor/ceiling hinges.\" Then he said he would look into hardware and call me back. \n\nA few days passed and, once again, no call back. I should have noticed a pattern at this point, but unfortunately I persisted. I called him again. He didn't recall our conversation. He had no idea what hardware to use and informed me that this company doesn't even sell hardware. I said \"ok, can I at least buy the doors we discussed?\" He said it would be easier if I just went online and purchased them that way. \n\nAt this point I have spent upward of a week playing phone tag with these people trying to get my questions answered and doors ordered and I am right where I started: online ordering doors. \n\nOn March 9th I ordered doors that were supposed to ship within 5 days according to the website.\n\nA couple of weeks went by and I finally got a call from someone. They said that they didn't have one of the sizes that I ordered, but that they would order more from the manufacturer and that the doors would all be delivered to me in mid-April. I was a little angry because all of the doors were supposed to have already been SHIPPED at that point and I was just waiting on these doors to list my home for sale. But, I reluctantly agreed and asked whether there would be any kind of a discount for the inconvenience of waiting over a month for doors that were supposed to ship within 5 days. They responded that \"they didn't have the authority to do that, but they would ask.\"\n\nI never heard back about the discount.\n\nOn April 8th, I got an email saying that the doors would be delivered on 4/30. Great... another 2 week delay. I responded via email expressing my disappointment with yet another delay and asked whether there would be any discount. My email never got a response.\n\nFast forward to 4/26 and I have heard absolutely nothing from anyone. The doors are supposed to be delivered on 4/30 and I know that they are going to be shipped via freight from across the country, but the website says that they are still processing the order and the doors haven't been shipped. So, I'm concerned that they will not arrive by 4/30. I tried to ask the instant message customer service person on the website about my order: they didn't  have any info. So, I send in emails and call. I get a call back a couple days later saying \"we got the other size doors from the manufacturer, but they didn't exactly match the original doors. We didn't know what to do.\" \n\nTHEY GOT THE DOORS AND DIDN\"T KNOW WHAT TO DO!? Maybe call me and ask instead of doing absolutely nothing!?\n\nI asked him to send me pictures of the doors so I could decide whether I wanted them. They were close enough, so I said \"fine, I'll take them.\" Once again I asked whether I would be receiving any kind of a discount for this incredible inconvenience. The guy on the phone said \"I'll ask, but I don't think you are going to get anything because these doors were already discounted when you bought them.\"\n\nThe doors arrived on 5/3. I never heard back from them about any sort of a discount for taking almost 2 months to deliver doors that were supposed to ship within 5 days and for me having to settle for mismatched doors. Oh, and the cherry on top of the poo pile: in the time that I was waiting for these doors, one of my neighbors listed her place for $70,000 less than what I was planning on listing for. Had I gotten the doors in time, my place would have already been sold before she ever listed.\n\nThis was the worst customer service I have experienced in a very, very long time. I cannot believe that they think it is acceptable to do business this way.\n\nThen they had the gall to send me an email asking me to review them.", "date": "2018-05-07 17:29:06"}, {"_key": "119709", "_id": "reviews/119709", "_rev": "_fNyp7ei--g", "review_id": "31SbAT-yLDprF85W5twiEg", "user_id": "1tB2RIPHoraOwvC-uBJE8g", "business_id": "Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag", "stars": 1, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I think this place is going out of business, they didn't have any soda, ranch, or curly fries when I went in.

We both ordered the drink called 4 down, 7 letters and my husband really liked it. I guess I underestimated the Campari a bit (like a dumbass) but I was not a fan of mine.

The Madeira Beach Chamber of Commerce should fine this restaurant for representing the beach so poorly. This restaurant is a typical example of a tourist trap. The food is overpriced, and the food quality is very low. \n\nWe ordered a calamari which was served with a sauce that was obviously A can of diced tomatoes in tomato sauce. I ordered grilled salmon, which came with broccoli and french fries. The french fries had been fried in the same grease as the fish, and had obviously been left to soak in the grease after it was done. The broccoli, while fresh, was nothing but steamed broccoli, without even butter or seasoning. The salmon was bland possibly frozen. My partner ordered chicken portobello. The sauce tasted like a watered down lemon sauce and the portion was so small that it was shameful. \n\nThe service was adequate although we did wait outside for a hostess for almost 5 minutes. Eventually we had to walk inside and request to be seated. Our waitress was adequate, although she clearly had other responsibilities which prevented her from giving us her best attention.\n\nAs a resident of Madeira Beach I am ashamed of this restaurant. I recommend that you go someplace else rather than this wretched restaurant. Don't be fooled by the view or the ambience, it is most miss-leading.

I wish I had read yelp reviews before wasting 2 hrs of my Friday night. We went there after my daughter's preschool graduation this past Friday since it was close to her school. Walking in it was a nice atmosphere, that's all I can say nice about this restaurant. Starting off it took 15 minutes to even order drinks. I ordered sprite for my daughter and asked for lemonade for my son.  They said they were out of lemonade but had Hawaiian Punch, I turned down the punch because of the high sugar content and opted for water which I'm certain came straight from the faucet. They came back with punch anyways stating the sprite was out.  We ordered the garlic bread since they were out of two other appetizers we wanted. They brought them out uncut and gave me a steak knife to cut myself. One was so burnt I'm confident they wrapped it in foil and put it in the microwave to catch on fire.  I sent that back and said to just take it off our bill. My husband and I both ordered the pasta with shrimp and garlic cream sauce. When it came out it was a big lump of extremely gummy mush that I wouldn't eat if it was 6 months in to the zombie apocalypse. The sauce was straight from a can and the top was covered in shrimp that wasn't even big enough to consider salad shrimp, all cold. I couldn't even order another meal as they were out of everything! My children had spaghetti, again cold and from a can. My nephew ordered a calzone,  then informed us they were out so he got pizza. Again,not cut they brought a pizza cutter for us to do ourselves.  There is so much more, but this alone was worth warning others. I am not even sure they have a working kitchen aside from a microwave, not to mention all the food is bought at a local grocery store I'm assuming frozen.Obviously I have no desire to go back.

We waited nearly 30 mins between our soup and the app then our main course sat on a tray behind us for 12 mins.  My baby drum which is my all time fav was dry cold and burnt as well as the Sauce needed hydrated it was so salty.  Had to ask her to clear nearly every plate .. Desert was served had to ask for silverware and no mention of coffee or another glass of wine.   \n\nInsult to injury she took CC and ran it 5 times setting off my fraud alert after clearing it with bank she ran it again and simply left it on table.

I took the burrito from the cashier at the drive thru window and went home to enjoy my burrito.

I went through the drive thru in hopes that they would help me there but they didn't. The person inside saw me at the window and did not acknowledge me even though they weren't officially closed. Long story short I called several times with no answer and knocked on the drive thru window at the same time.

I got a message from the owner saying he'd like to have me come in to receive a FREE service because they previously ruined my hair. So, I thought since he's the owner my hair would turn out good but I was wrong. I'm really unhappy with this whole experience. I showed him multiple photos on google of what I wanted done to my hair which was a lot of blonde. I told him I do not want any ORANGE in my hair as I wanted a \"white blonde\". He said you won't have any orange in your hair. I have a message from him the OWNER saying I would receive a FREE service if I deleted my previous review. He should of NEVER offered a free service if it wasn't really free! So, I said how much because I thought I was getting my hair done for free. He said since your hair is long and thick you'll have to pay for the hair color and \"medicine\" but he won't charge me for his time. I said ok how much he said $80. He said it would cost me $180 if he didn't give me a discount which is very pricey. He put a lot of highlights on my hair and worked quickly as he seemed to want to rush on my hair which I do not like. My hair is important to me, I don't want my hair to fall out. He said this medicine he's gonna put on my hair is $50 for a treatment and that I needed it because of the blonde going on my hair which I know any coloring is damaging and blonde is very damaging but he said he charges everyone who gets hair color for this so called medicine which they mix into the color you dye your hair. You can purchase the entire set online (3 bottles) for $75 which is supposed to give you like 15 applications so he's definitely charging a lot of money! He only put No.1 on my hair and not No.2 or No.3. He also had a lady (the receptionist) wash out my hair? Ok, even though she was nice why would he have her do that when she said she knows nothing about hair because I asked if she's styling my hair and she said she doesn't do hair and I wouldn't want her to do my hair. As I was waiting there was a lady next to me, she got her hair cut and a perm. She was done but she wasn't happy, she told the lady she didn't like the hair cut and she had her style it more and trim off a little more but the lady still wasn't happy. The girl told the client when she washes her hair it will be better.. um how? I know she left very unhappy! Also the lady behind me was getting her hair cut and when he (the owner) was done cutting her hair she looked in the mirror and wanted it different and styled different so that made me have to wait longer but 2 clients were not happy and also myself. That's not a good look TJ nail and spa! I had a towel on my head and waited about 30 mins just to get my hair blow dried because he was cutting another clients hair. I seen orange roots, I was mad!!! He finally came over and I said I don't like the orange color on my roots, can you put a toner on my hair and he said it's not orange it's the lighting. The lighting?! It wasn't the lighting! He proceeds to blow dry hair and then starts straighten it without asking me if I wanted it straightened or curled, you are supposed to pick how you want your hair styled. At that point I knew my hair wasn't what I wanted and it wasn't gonna be fixed even if I wanted it too. I just sat there in the hair, mad and yet again very disappointed! I looked in the mirror and seen my hair damaged and brittle, orange and brassy and not even close to what I wanted. There goes my money down the drain, yet again. I will not be back to get my hair ruined and he made me delete my previous review which was also 0-1 stars before I left his salon but I had to write this one, this is real, this is honest, beware of getting your hair completely ruined and nothing close to what you want! Like I said I showed the OWNER multiple photos and I stated I did NOT want any orange on my hair but I did have orange on my hair, I didn't get what I wanted like he said, he said he doesn't mess up, he's been doing hair for years. As a salon owner I think he should take the time to really do what the client wants and achieve what the client wants done to their hair, if the workersowner would do that then there shouldn't be any bad reviews but there is so that shows you they do not care, not even the owner cares. They just want to rush and get done to get paid, they don't care if the customer is happy or not. There are more bad reviews from people going to this salon and having horrible experiences but he is bribing people to delete their bad reviews because he told me the bad reviews is hurting his business which is why people do reviews, to let people know this place is awesome or this place is horrible, beware, stay away. I do reviews to let people know the good, the bad and the ugly. I do reviews anywhere and I'm always 100% honest.

I am not the type to complain, but I have been here twice and both times I have had terrible service at the bar. The first bartender served me but acted as if I was bothering him.  This second time, with a completely different bartender mind you, it was worse. I am not dressed like a street person or anything, and I am not pan-handling. But you would think that I was the way he acted. First, I sit at the bar and I am waiting for service. So, the bartender walks by me, pours a glass a water, turns in front of me, puts the water down, gives me some stupid half-grin then walks off. Not one audible word of greeting or a grunt passed between his lips. Then, he gets a menu, drops that down and walks off again! Not a sound. Is it me, but when a customer enters an eating establishment, shouldn't they be greeted in some manner?  Not looked at like \"why are you here. I have better things to do\"?  I am not looking for a royal salute or anything. Just \"Hey man, what can I get ya?\"  or something to that affect.   Anyway, I start to look at the drink and food menus. Then, a group of anywhere from 10-15 people come in behind me and say, to what looked like a manager, \"We don't want to eat, is it ok if we just have a few drinks at the bar?\". The manager says \"Sure.\" The guy then says, \"Can we get few beers down here\"? (paraphrasing). The bartender says \"Sure!\" and proceed to service this group, one-by-one, as they order drinks. Ok, fine technically, I was looking at the menu when this started. But still, he walked back and forth, right in front of me, for about 10-12 minutes. Not once did he say, \"Hey, just shout and I will get you something\", or \"Hey man, just give me a few minutes and I will be right with you\". Nothing!  It was obvious it was a big group, but I mean, he gave no acknowledgement to the fact that I was sitting there waiting! \n\nLong story short - after this 10-12 minutes of waiting, I just walked out and went somewhere else. Now this place has about 4\\5 stars with around 500 reviews. So, I guess people like it. But their bartenders are as unfriendly as I have ever encountered.

The mushrooms in my dish were impossible to cut even with a knife and the rest of the vegetables had a freeze dried feel to them being the consistency of bark. The pork was a bit rubbery and only had flavor from the oil draped over everything that seemed under seasoned as well and definitely tasted old. This was labeled in the menu as a 10/10 spicy rating, it was at most a 2. I didn't bother saying anything because of how rude the waiter/host was, but I'll get to that. The rice was cold and clumped together in chunks that led me to understand that it was previously microwaved. The dumplings looked ok, but the dough was undercooked and the sauce was just soy sauce that had no care whatsoever put into it. Her noodles were very bland and whoever prepared them obviously doesn't care about their food. The noodles had the same flavor deprived oil from my dish in it, just disappointing really. This type of food is supposed to be robust and I've eaten at a ton of places across the country and internationally that do care about what the put out. This place doesn't care anymore. The man that seated us was incredibly rude the entire time. He huffed and puffed and stomped his feet when I asked for the real Chinese menu instead of the Americanized Chinese menu. And, they used to throw shade if you asked for the Americanized menu, now it's the opposite. After we were done we both had a decent amount of food left and I decided to take it to feed to the raccoons that come around my house. They look cool and I like to feed them. Anyway, the take out container was dirty from previous food in it! I was blown away, especially when I pointed it out and the rude person pretending to be a man grabbed it out of my hand and stormed, literally stormed off before I was even half way through my sentence. I was calm the whole time, not sure what this guys deal is. Then came back with the same container that he washed! He washed the dirty container that should never have been used in the first place and thought that was acceptable. I will never go here again and I hope they go out of business so no one has to be punished by this Handy Nasty food. Disgusting food and disgusting people, except for the one guy who worked there who said goodbye to us. He seemed mortified because he knew what the cuck host just did to everyone in the dining area throughout the day and I assume throughout his life.

We let Megan know that we disliked the drinks and she says \"what's wrong them?\" We tell her that they both just taste bad. She then says \"well I made them the exact way the menu says\" \n\nThen she sticks a straw in one of the drinks and says \"that taste like it's suppose to\" Then she says \"since I already made the drinks, you'll have to pay for them\" \n\nThis is completely unacceptable and poor customer service. If a guest orders anything that they dislike, the right thing to do is ask what would they like instead. I work in the restaurant industry and so does my friend who was with me. So we know true hospitality and what Megan said was the opposite.\nI ask to speak with the manager. Megan tells me that the manager isn't in until 5pm (it's almost 2pm at this point)\n\nMegan then says, \"I've worked here for 6 years so I know what I'm doing and what I'm talking about\" I then ask for the hotel manager. Megan says \"I'll get you something else and you just pay for the original two drinks that you disliked. \n\nWhy on earth would we pay for the original two drinks in lieu of new ones? Why wouldn't she just comp the drinks, or void them, or separate them off for the manager to come later on?

Based on the menu, this establishment seems to pride itself on the brisket. I had the tacos and my wife had the brisket platter. The tacos come on deep fried corn tortillas, which you have two break in half in order to fold, effectively making it more of  a sandwich. The brisket was wholly inedible and flavorless. The fat overwhelmed the taco, and not the good, melt in your mouth fat, but the chewy, gristly fat. My wife's sliced brisket was no better. No juice , no smoke ring, no flavor. I left two of the three tacos on the plate and pushed it to the side. The waitress came by and took the plate with no inquiry as to why I wasn't eating them. We also ordered \"the best Mac and cheese from any Brentwood smokehouse\" or something to that effect for the kids, and it was clearly shells and cheese from a box. Not only was it completely uninteresting, but it was $5.50 per kid, served with toast and no drink included. We ordered kids lemonades that were $2.50 each, although that price was not listed on the kids menu. Once the check came with everything included, I told the waitress I was surprised she was charging me for the brisket and she asked \"why?\" When I explained, she said \"ok I'll tell them\". In the 5-10 minutes before we left, 'them' did nothing and I ended up paying $70 for a pitiful attempt at barbecue. If you want the real deal, you won't find it in Brentwood.

We were visiting Nashville and an internet search for restaurants showed this was one of the places to go to in Nashville.  We went for brunch.  I had a good feeling when we first when in and Zeppelins Over the Hills and Far Away was playing but that was probably the most memorable thing.  We didn't start off with the whippped feta, which seems to be the big thing there, maybe that's why we didn't have the same experience as other people.  I ordered the French toast cinnabon thing which was fine.  My wife however, had the Shakshuka and did not like it at all.  Too spicy in the morning, and as someone mentioned in another review, it would have been nice if that was mentioned (although it does say spicy on the menu, I think she was expecting a different spice).  Also, the poached egg to me was disgusting.  My wife used a spoon but could have drank it with a straw.  I think there were two, I give her credit for forcing down one, I couldn't have done it.  We also ordered a bloody mary  and a mimosa.  There wasn't much mimosa as far as volume goes and my bloody mary was a little thick, I think because of olive juice.  We each had side orders of bacon, two slices each at $5, and not like it was super thick.  Overall, the bill was about $80 and my wife was still hungry.  The waitress did notice that my wife hardly ate anything and mentioned getting the whipped feta saying it would help her stomach which was now hurting because of the spice.  She said no, but it would have been nice if the waitress had brought over a sample.  Anyway, like I said, about $80; $10 each for the mimosa and bloody mary, $14 for the three cinnabon french toast, $13 for the Shakshuka, $10 for four slices of bacon and whatever it was for the coffee (which was good).  I'm counting the tip so the coffee must have been up there too as well as the extra pita my wife asked for.  Listen, The Olive Tree Cafe in the Village in NYC has been there forever.

After which, we could either park across the street or pay out of pocket to continue parking in the garage. I elected to remain in the garage. Apparently, the monthly garage parking fees cannot be pro-rated. Meaning if you stay in the garage May 31st through July 1st you are going to be charged for 3 months, rather than the 1 month you actually stayed there. My situation was similar. My company covered the costs up until May 30th, and I parked in the garage May 31st through mid-August. So, to my surprise, as I was preparing to check out, I was slapped with a $700 ($175/month) parking bill. Despite the fact I elected to be billed monthly. I didn't even try to dispute the last 2 weeks of August that I'm being charged for. But charging a full month for 1 day in May, where is the customer service aspect in that? Especially considering my vehicle was broken into and cost me upwards of $800 to get the window repaired and replace the lost items. To add insult to injury, I was told on two separate occasions that due to my misfortune in their garage (the break in) they would take care of the parking fee for me.

I ended up abruptly moving to NYC and needing a new phone number and assumed my membership cancelled when I never received an email from the spa. I called the Marlton location while in town on business and asked if those credits would transfer, to which they told me yes. I booked a facial and a massage a week in advance. I left both my phone number and email and when I received a confirmation email about the appointment I assumed all must have been well. I arrived early to my appointment to ensure that my credits were still okay to be used. The receptionist said she had to call Morristown, but did not stop me from going into either my facial OR massage. \n\nThe esthetician, Karen, was incredibly friendly and had a gentle touch. I wish she had done more extractions and really gone to work on my face. I appreciate the gentle-ness, but there's always a painful time during facials that you just have to grin and bear for better results, and I was hoping for more of that. Otherwise, I thought Karen was lovely. I was dismayed that between my facial and my massage there weren't any robes to transfer between rooms, so I got dressed and waited for about ten minutes while Karen tried to find my massage therapist, and then while she turned the room over until he came to get me. \n\nMy massage therapist asked about my concerns and then left  me to change. By the time we started the massage it was already about 2:15. He was good about asking me how the pressure was, but I felt like I've gotten better massages from an airport chair massage. He used a lot of forearm, and little else technique wise. The massage was not thorough in the slightest. No scalp massage, no middle back, parts of my arms and legs were barely covered. I've had enough fifty minute massages to know that this was lacking. The massage ended at 2:50, not even close to fifty minutes (nor sixty if you're counting the ten minute changing time). After I got dressed my massage therapist was outside with a bottle of water, but he did not walk me out the door. He said goodbye in the hallway and I was left wandering in circles (ended up in an employee break room!) before finding my way out front. \n\nWhen I went to check out I held my tongue on the massage because I figured I had paid for it a while ago, I would suck it up and chalk it up to a bad but free (minus tip) experience. I was then told by the receptionist that she had yet to get in touch with Morristown regarding my credits. I had a bad feeling about this.

A manager was brought over who said she would take care of things and would give me a call before running my credit card (I wanted to leave my tip on it).

It was supposed to be simple with slight scalloped edges on top. It was a disaster and looked so unprofessional everyone who has seen it couldn't believe that I paid money for it. We were going to stick the naked cake on top of another round, however all the round cakes came with a ring of buttercream roses on top. I was never told that there would be roses. Apparently this is their standard, but no one mentioned it to me, so how would I know it would be on there? Also when I stacked the cakes, the naked cake icing was a different color than the other two cakes. All the same icing, one super white and the other two were a yellow color. They tasted different and I know what the frosting should taste like since I had a sample of it before ordering. Obviously they messed up the icing on two of the cakes. Stephanie explained that they didn't know I would be stacking it so it didn't seem like it would matter. All the cakes were also supposed to be on cardboard that was cut to the size of the bottom of the cakes. Stephanie and I spoke about this on the phone and I emailed her a confirmation that this would be done. Naturally, they weren't cut so they stood out terribly on our cake base. Plus we had to take the naked cake off of its cardboard base so we could stack it, which was just annoying and unnecessary. Also the cakes were dry. It was just so disappointing all around.

I now work with disabled persons trying to help them find employment. We're not supposed to meet them in their home as per company policy. My client, who is disabled, and I have visited this pizzeria a few times per her request because it's close to her house and she feels comfortable meeting there. Today we went in at 1:45pm and I noticed it was busier than usual (typically we go at a time where it is not busy restaurant hours.) Before going to sit down like we normally do, and again this was only our third time here, We were greeted aggressively and immediately by who I assume is the owner. I started to ask \"do you mind if we sit here..\" and was cut off. He said, \"I have a real problem with you coming in here not buying anything and sitting taking up a table for 2-3 hours.\" (Mind you, we have never been there the previous 2 times over an hour and 15 minutes - as I have a limited amount of time I am able to work with each client.  There also has been about 15 other open tables in the restaurant each time we were there, including today.) This person responded very hostile and aggressive. Had the gentleman asked politely if I purchased a drink or a slice of pizza we could sit and go about our business, however he met me with an extremely volatile attitude and aggressive choice of words. Again, as someone who's worked in the food industry, I understand how it can be frustrating for someone to come in and sit without purchasing anything. With that said, how this employee decided to treat me in this moment made me and my disabled client extremely uncomfortable. The rudeness was completely unnecessary and being familiar with the industry I wouldn't have minded at all purchasing something from this place in order to sit there for an hour, had I been spoken to appropriately. The part I feel the worst about is how my client was treated. I had to explain to her why \"that man was so rude\". It's unacceptable how me and my client were made to feel today. She's already treated differently in the world and she felt terrible after this interaction. I'm mortified that this had to happen in this way, and this whole situation could have been completely avoided had we been treated like human beings. What the employee was trying to say was completely justified, however we were yelled at and made to feel like we were unwelcome for no reason whatsoever. I will not be entering this restaurant again for obvious reasons, and I encourage anyone who has any empathy for disabled persons to do the same.

I currently live in the Pittsburgh area.  So when I am home, I love coming to Collingswood for some delicious eats.  I had a positive experience the last time I was at Sabrina and was hoping to create more since I was asking my friends to be in my bridal party.\n\nThere are no reservations for brunch on Sabrina's on the weekend but they will accept at least a 30-45 min call aheads for a party.  My friend did a call ahead for ten am. My friends tend to struggle with being on time and there is a policy that everyone has to be there to be seated.  The policy makes sense and I was open to the hostess that we were at fault for not all being there.   My friends didn't all show up until 10:40.\n\nThere was no table available which was fine since we were late.  But I was not okay with the hostess rudeness towards us.  She told us that we never did the call ahead despite the verified text from the restaurant saying we called ahead on my friend's phone.  We let that comment go since we were taking ownership that we were not all there on time.  She told us that the wait would be about 30-45 minutes and they will text us when the table is open.  She told us to go walk around since there was a farmers market happening close by the restaurant.  She also reminded us that the whole party had to be here.  I don't mind the reminder but again her tone was rude towards us.  We let it go again because we were at fault for our struggle with timeliness. \n\nWe take a walk and about ten minutes later we get a text that the table is ready.  We get back quickly and wait in line since there was people checking in/getting seated in front of us.  When it is our turn, the hostess tells us we missed our five minute mark and the wait was going to be a 15-30 minute wait.  Again her tone was rude and this time we were not at fault.  Her time said we arrived there six minutes after the text.  Okay this means... we were on time but we waited patiently in line for people in front of us to check in/be seated.  Which means the hostess did not wait and sat people at our table. \n\nI initially was going to let it go but her rudeness was leaving not a good feeling.  My friend argues with her because it was not fair we were being blamed for something that was her fault this time.  Also she told us to go for a walk since the wait was going to be 30-45 minutes?!\n\nThe arguing was not worth it and I told my friends we were leaving.

Now the biggest problem was the service! 25 min to be greeted by waitress and 10 more min to actually get the drinks. Refills were given if you were lucky enough to flag somebody down.
