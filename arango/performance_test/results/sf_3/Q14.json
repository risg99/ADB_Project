We were staying at the Hyatt Regency so it was just a quick walk from there. We arrived around 10 AM and there was no wait for our little party of two. We got to sit outside, which was great because it was breezy and not too hot. \n\nI'm not a coffee drinker, but my wife loved that they bring you out your very own carafe for coffee and you don't have to ask for refills. They do the same with water as well, which was great for me. I also wanted a chocolate milk, but I kept forgetting to ask the server. This is where the lack of a 5th star comes in. We only saw our server a few times throughout the whole meal. When I did finally ask for the chocolate milk, I was halfway down with my food (my fault, not the server), but by the time she brought it out I had finished my food. She did make up for it by not charging for it, and she even brought me the large size (I ordered small) in a to-go cup since we were done eating. The chocolate milk itself was a disappointment, though. It just tasted like milk with chocolate syrup mixed in.\n\nFor our meal, my wife and I got the exact same thing: The Trifecta breakfast. We both did scrambled eggs, the Belgian waffle, and bacon. I also got a side of the seasoned potatoes. I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the waffle since it wasn't the whole entree. And it was so good! It was so soft and fluffy. The whipped butter spread easily over it, and the syrup they bring you is hot (a must for me). I did try one bite with the berry compote, but I prefer syrup. The bacon was cooked perfectly--crispy but not overdone. The seasoned potatoes were good too, although I like crispy fried potatoes at breakfast better. \n\nOverall we really enjoyed our breakfast here.

Broth (of any kind) can be dull and bland but Saigon Restaurant does not allow such characteristics in their fabulous Pho broth.  The accoutrements are always fresh--basil, bean sprouts, jalapeno, lime.  Don't forget to pop those into your steamy hot bowl of soup for added freshness and flavor.  Fresh Spring Rolls are also pretty decent too, but not as superb as the Pho.  \n\nThe service is genuine, never over-the top/goober-friendly/fake-smiles.

We drank it, obviously, but switched to beer immediately thereafter. Good selection of beers on draft and bottle as well.\n\nWe went ahead and ordered the tuna.

It was phenom.\n\nWe also ordered the scallop gratin; for the price tag, I was rather displeased. Minimal amount of scallop- too much potato.\n\nWe had some sort of trout dip dish.

I selected their blueberry Hefeweizen and enjoyed the crisp flavor on this warm night, even though little to no berry taste came through. I would probably try something else next time. The food menu was possibly too large( in my opinion) with sandwich, pizza, apps and entrees offered. I was very hungry and 75% of the menu appealed to me, so I went to our excellent server Frank for his advice. He suggested a few dishes and I thought my beer choice would pair nicely with the pan roasted chicken entree. It proved to be good advice, a nicely cooked Frenched breast with the skin crispified served with what seemed to be local asparagus and mashed potatoes. The fowl was tender and juicy still, the pan sauce was lightly citrusy and herbed, it was good but could have been better if reduced and thickened. The mashed were ok, and probably the weakest link in the dish. I had an add on Caesar salad that was fair and overpriced( as add ons go) at $6. Trish went with his advice and ordered a shrimp and scallops special, she loved it and I have to admit, they are sourcing quality crustaceans.\n\nMost others in our group ordered burgers and we heard many good things.

We visit New Orleans once a year for the past several years and just added this to our must visit list for when we are in town (along with Willie Mae, Mothers and Cafe du Monde, and Big Fisherman). \n\nWe came here for a second dinner (around 9:45 PM so no wait) during one of our food conquests. The 5 of us ordered family style so we can try a little bit of everything. Our orders were delish, good quality and good taste. Everything on the dish made sense and the flavors complimented each other (not like this other place we went to during our food conquest).\n\nTerrine Of Slow Cooked Foie Gras - Frois gras patte. I've had some in the past that didn't fare so well. Not the same as frois gras saut\u00e9ed, but done well. I'd order this again. \n\nCrawfish Bisque - Utter creamy goodness for crawfish lovers. You really taste the crawfish. \n\nSalad Luke- Liked the salad. Get a lil of everything on one fork and it's a nice fresh bite. Creamy, sweet and sour. One negative, it was too overdressed. Maybe because it was late, the kitchen person had a heavy hand. Would still get again and ask for less dressing. \n\nEntrec\u00f4te Grill\u00e9e Et Frites- Rib eye steak with fancy butter done right. All 5 of us hands down LOVED this dish. \n\nFresh gulf fish of the day was sheepshead fish battered. - At the end of the trip we didn't want anymore fried food, but this dish was okay. It was gone by the end of the evening even though we were full. \n\nPoulet Grand-m\u00e8re - Normally I do not like chicken. It's usually white meat and dry. However, this is a half chicken (bones and all) and makes it to my top chicken meals. The chicken was moist, flavorful, and went so well with Allen Benton's bacon and the mixed veggies. One small downside is the mash was on the salty side, but we'd order this again. Another 5/5 at the table.\n\nBrendan's Bread Pudding- The only other place I've had this better was at a top US steakhouse. Very good. \n\nSteamed Chocolate - Gone in 1 minute. \n\nBourbon Vanilla Bean Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e - Also good. \n\nAll in all, 5 out of 5 of us liked Lukes. The service was excellent (waitress even gave up a list of places to visit for our trip next year) and the prices were very reasonable for an upper scale type place.

We queried the nice waitress multiple  times as we started to lose our patience, and she had no clue as to why it took so long. Finally, the food came out, only after we had lost our cool and had to express some discontent to the waitress. Well, besides the ungodly long wait, the entr\u00e9es were not too far from a total disappointment! The pizza was of Pizza Hut quality, and the crust was noticeably stale as if it was pulled out of the oven centuries ago. The meatball spaghetti was a dish of disaster mainly because of the mediocre marinara sauce on top of a clump of inadequately cooked noodles. Other dishes were aceptable but barely noteworthy.

This is a Jordanian restaurant with a wide mix of foods available. I enjoy coming here because the service is good and the staff are always attentive.

They will refill your tea cup with hot water if you ask.  I wish they would brew their own tea though and this would be a great thing.  \n\nMy favorite appetizer is the Foule.  It is puree of fava beans, some garbanzos spiced with garlic, jalapeno, lemon, olive oil and parsley.  It is served warm and with pita bread.  I love that this place gives enough bread and you do not have to ask for more.  If you are running low they ask you if you would like more.  Great customer service.  Another appetizer I like is Mesabaha a puree of chickpeas and humus with humus, jalapeno, olive oil, parsley and garlic.  The Babaganoush is also good and it has a nice smokey flavor. \n\nTheir lentil soup is well seasoned and you can taste the flavor of cumin \n\nI usually get a sandwich because it is a smaller portion than a whole plate of food since I get an appetizer as well when I come and otherwise I would not be able to eat all the food.

Not for construction issues, but to remodel the staff. Our server was nice enough, but that's not enough.

Not cool. And our booth was close enough to the counter to hear them arguing about who forgot to put in our order, or who didn't make it or whatever.

The croquettes were perfect and balanced out the saltiness of the pig ears.\nFor mains, we ordered the Caribbean seafood pepper pot and the goat curry with the black eyed peas and roasted potatoes as sides. The pepper pot was too fishy for my fianc\u00e9e, and the sour notes did not pair as well with the rest of the meal - probably wouldn't order it again.

Such a cleverly named restaurant. Have you seen their brand/logo design? Amaze balls (buy a t-shirt!). I've hit up Pho King a few times by now (good spot when you want something quick and easy before hitting up Rexall Place) but this was the first time I've been to their newly renovated digs. Everything is much cleaner and aesthetically pleasing. The right hand side of the resto now consists of a counter instead of seating area.\n\nA and I stopped in for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon. The place was reasonably busy with several tables full along with a few people popping in to pick up takeout orders. The menu is extensive with your typical Vietnamese offerings but they hilariously have a full page dedicated to Western foods/breakfast meals. Random but it must cater to the clientele in the area???\n\nI'll never understand why so many other Viet/Asian places in town do this. Take a page from Pho Tau Bay's playbook and focus on one thing and do it well. Bonus, they're open everyday of the week (Sunday's now!).\n\n- Bun bo hue (P18) ($10.95 king) - I went with their bun bo hue because I've never had it here before. The broth was fragrant with a good depth and flavour profile. I found it to be a bit on the lighter/cleaner side if that makes any sense. The meat balls were delicious! A little bit of green onions and sliced onions gives their bowls an extra zip of flavour. Good stuff.\n- Grilled lemongrass chicken with kimchi (R23) ($13.95) - A was having some trouble deciding but eventually went with the grilled lemongrass chicken skewers over rice with a side of kimchi and vegetables. The lemongrass chicken had an odd texture to it that I can't even put in writing. It was cooked fine but it must have been the cut of meat that they were using. She only ate one skewer and I ended up taking the rest as leftovers. As for the kimchi, it wasn't very good -  kind of flavourless and a chore to eat. Blah. This is why I rarely, if ever, veer from ordering pho at Vietnamese spots.\n\nOn a previous trip, I went with a buddy before an Oilers game where we each ordered pho:\n- Seafood noodle soup (P17) ($10.95 regular) - a couple shrimps, kabuki, and shrimp balls. The broth was great - flavourful and clean tasting! Sort of sate style but with just a bit of spiciness to it. Definitely would get this again.\n- Rare steak and meatball beef noodle soup (P8) ($8.95 regular) - my buddy went to town on his bowl. There was nothing left after we finished devouring both of our bowls.\n\nSolid spot to grab a bowl of pho. Prices are reasonable and service is fast. Slightly ghetto area of town but that's part of it's charm.

Tantalizing and true reminders of the real purpose of your mission. Once gaining a strong foothold on the plateau, the Sherpa guide(hostess) assists you to your base camp. Your second guide sets you up with all the gear you need to successfully scale the savory slope of epicurean delight. \n\nJoe, as our base camp guide, gathered the intel necessary for our rations. Our party of four perused the ration sheet(menu) and detailed the desired canteen(kitchen) output as required for proper nutrition on this gastronomic expedition. Our server was quite busy, so service was a tad slow at first, and I had to remind him I needed some lemons(to prevent scurvy?). Joe turned out to be a pretty nice guy, and I even shook his hand before we mounted our pack horses to depart. \n\nOkay, back to ground zero, review-wise.\n\nTwo of us chose the Norte\u00f1o Combinado,  a steak empanada with chile morita sauce and queso fresco, a shredded beef taquito with guacamole and black bean sauce, and one crisp shredded beef or chicken taco. Served with congri(black beans and rice). \nIn one word? Delicious! In two words? Deliciously delicious! Lots of flavor, with a slight touch of spicy heat in the empanada. The taquito provided a nice crunch even while lathered in a creamy guacamole sauce. I will order this dish again. And again, and again!\n\nMy better half(or three fourths?) ordered the Trail Ensalada(salad). Unfortunately it was missing the pumpkin seeds as described in the menu. Otherwise a nice salad, although a little light on the full-feeling factor. She was satisfied, but felt a wee bit wishing she could have sampled some of my taco! What a beautiful woman will do to maintain her girlish figure! (I love you to the highest elevation and back, Honey!)\n\nOur fourth climber, er, party member ordered the Del Rey Burrito with shredded beef. This thing was the size of a gold bar you might find ensconced into the steep hillsides below the mesa. She advised it was a perfect blend of taste and temptation! I was surprised she was able to eat almost the entire burrito! Throw caution to the wind!\n\nThe atmospheric conditions within the plateau(the atmosphere in the restaurant) are reminiscent of a lot of Mexican restaurants, but with a feeling of quality and no kitsch. This is certainly a higher end establishment and it shows in the quality of ingredients and food fare. Most days, at dinner hours, expect quite a line-up of eager, hungry patrons at the door. They do have some comfortable waiting seating for a few lucky folks. \n\nNow for a nice, warm and fuzzy human moment....\nOnce we were seated, I noticed a charming young family seated next to us. Handsome guy with a beautiful wife and three of the most adorable little girls this side of the Rio Grande. Sometimes you can feel 'goodness' and 'love' within a room, and I certainly felt this effect emanating from this family. I was moved to step over and tell them my feelings. They were very appreciative and receptive. They gave details on how fortunate they were, and that their littlest cutie was their 'Miracle Baby'. A great feeling and reaffirmation that this world still has a LOT of good, decent people in it! There were some nice goodbyes when they left, I felt as though I had known them for years!\n\nMuch to our surprise, when we finished our meals, our server Joe appeared with a platter of some decadent looking mountain of light brown goodness topped with whipped cream! This was the 'Fried Ice Cream' - chunky monkey rolled in corn flakes, flash fried, topped with Mexican chocolate sauce and whipped cream. He announced that this loving family asked for and paid for us to be able to enjoy this treat! We were all very taken and moved. It was a crazily delicious and dangerous treat to our tastebuds! So very thankful to them, where and whom ever you are!\n\nOverall, our climb to the Red Mesa summit was a complete success! We did not get to plant our great nation's flag on the peak, however.

You have chips, taco shell, taco, or burrito, combined with cheese, corn, tomatoes, combined with a few sauces, and that's the entire menu! Portions aren't that big, yet prices start at around $6. The taste isn't terribly original or exciting either. So it seems you're not getting a heck lot of value for your money. (unless you use coupons from their mailing list)\n\nOther than that, I saw no problems with this restaurant. Restroom was clean. Tables and beverage area were clean.

It is located in a strip-mall near the Meridian Technology Center in Carmel, Indiana. It is easy to locate with plentiful parking around back. They have the options of outdoor seating, indoor seating near a very large sliding glass window (if you're lucky enough to get one of the few tables near it), or regular indoor seating. The atmosphere is excellent and feels very open thanks to the the floor-to-ceiling windows wrapping around most of the dining area. It really helps brighten the mood inside.\n\nService was excellent which was to be expected since we went during off-peak hours. I ordered the three lil' pigs which I enjoyed, though a bit dry. I chose the brewery fries as my side, though I hear their coleslaw is excellent. The fries were fries, nothing spectacular to be mentioned about them.\n\nI settled on their famous Wheat Ale to drink with my meal. My fiance ordered the Champagne Velvet. Both have very low IBU's which is perfect because neither of us are hopheads. If you haven't had the Wheat Ale before, even if you are a hophead, you must try it. It has excellent flavor for a low IBU beer.\n\nOn our next visit we are hoping to try their line of lambics. Having recently discovered Lindemans Framboise and really enjoying it, we are hoping their lambics capture a similar flavor profile.\n\nOverall I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to sit and have a drink with friends, or just to have a good drink with dinner. I haven't found that \"gotta have it\" food item on their menu yet, but everything I've tried is above average for your usual pub fare.

It's not the best decor I've ever seen but is unique nonetheless.\nThe prices at this place are very affordable. They do have a large menu (apart from a separate lunch menu) that contains everything from empanadas to pasta. The thing I liked about their menu was that they had at least 15 items separately listed on a 'vegetarian' section of the menu. That is always helpful for vegetarians. \nI had ordered a lamb gyro with a side of home-made chips off the lunch menu. The gyro was served on an open pita with a generous dose of Tzatziki sauce (Which I love). The lamb meat was well cooked and the whole dish was quite filling. The only thing I would criticize were the potato chips that were served on the side.

The beef comes from a farm in northern Indiana, the produce from Piazza, the bacon from Smoking Goose, and the bread from a bakery also located in northern Indiana. They certainly make an effort to know exactly where their ingredients are coming from, and servers and hostesses are knowledgeable about these locations. \n\nDuring my stop in Harry and Izzy's this afternoon, I started with a calamari appetizer; often, these are a dime a dozen at fine dining establishments, but Harry and Izzy's made it a very enjoyable starter. The calamari was served with a sweet chili sauce that complimented the dish well. We followed up the starter with a filet slider and a shrimp po-boy slider served with a side of fried green tomatoes. The filet slider was incredible; the meat was tender and flavorful and paired with a tangy sauce with a hint of horseradish (or perhaps I was just smelling the cocktail sauce that was waiting for me). The po-boy slider was just as delicious; the fried shrimp sat on a bed of lettuce and dill tartar and came with a side of the signature cocktail sauce. The blend of creamy tartar and the eye-watering heat of the cocktail sauce was incredible, and to be frank I could have eaten about five more sliders without growing tired. The fried green tomatoes were superb as well.\n\nWe finished with a dessert; I chose the Signature Brownie (which my server informed me was voted the best dessert in Indianapolis). The brownie was topped with a scoop of fantastic vanilla ice cream and a dollop of whipped cream, with a cherry perched on the very top. It was extremely delicious, which leads me to understand why it was voted the best dessert in town.\n\nThe staff at Harry and Izzy's is also great; I met with Kara Biggerstaff, the Guest Services Manager, who explained the ins and outs of Harry and Izzy's and St. Elmo as well as providing excellent recommendations on food and drinks. \n\nIt's no secret why Harry and Izzy's is such an Indy favorite, and I wholeheartedly intend to send my business there in the future.", "date": "2016-02-02 21:09:04"}, {"_key": "100702", "_id": "reviews/100702", "_rev": "_fNyp7Di--O", "review_id": "lnFgJvyEwRMwf3zGom9BTQ", "user_id": "Ui6WPdhNc2oq-cFkf-4Nbg", "business_id": "hkh5iyDeGLNhu-JUQFRE1Q", "stars": 4, "useful": 4, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "text": "Our stay at the Royal Sonesta Hotel in the Nola met my expectations.

The restaurant was full, but we were seated right on time for our reservation.   \n\nSince this was my first visit, I had to try the famous shrimp cocktail.  The fresh horseradish definitely makes a fabulous cocktail sauce!  The $17.95 price tag is hefty, but I kind of saw it as an investment in a cultural experience (nice rationalization isn't it?).  I then had a strip steak prepared Izzy style which was really delicious!  The steak was tender, and cooked to a perfect medium rare.    I did appreciate that a side is included with the steaks; one of my pet peeves is paying $50 for a steak and then being charged extra for a potato or some vegetables.    I opted for the saut\u00e9ed green beans which were prepared with red peppers and onions - quite tasty!    \n\nI didn't try any of the desserts since I was in a meat coma from the steak, but it was a good meat coma, so no complaints!

We were famished and needed a place to eat and catch up after the emotional roller coaster we'd been on the past few days.  I'd been meaning to stop in for a bite to eat after hearing they opened in Voorhees Town Center, and I'm so glad I made the suggestion.\n\nFirst of all, our waitress Lacey was phenomenal.  There is not often that a server can handle all of the demands from my eclectic family!  There's also not too many times when I learn my server's name and make a note of it in my phone so I'll remember their name later for my review.  She was so helpful with the food, cocktail, and beer menus.  She came to ask us for refills many times and to just check in on the 10 of us.  Lacey knew the menu well and offered suggestions on various items.  Right before our food came out she came over with a huge sampling of all of their different types of beers for us to try on the house! Because she made this extra effort, a few of us switched our drinks to try a pint of one of the samples we liked (nice move Lacey!).  \n\nWe all enjoyed our meals and the dishes ranged from burgers with sweet potato fries to tacos, salads, and appetizers.  They have a huge menu with various tasty options and our party took full advantage of the variety.  Iron Hill even had a section of \"small plates\" on their menu which I really enjoyed because I was having a hard time deciding what to order.  I chose the fried goat cheese (something I'd heard of and have wanted to try) and the pulled pork taco both of which were very flavorful and the perfect size for my appetite.  We ordered 2 nacho appetizers which was plenty of food to start us off.  I would say that one nacho appetizer is good for 4-5 people.\n\nThe best part was that we didn't feel rushed out of the restaurant.  We hadn't seen each other in quite some time and were coming together to honor and plan our grandmother's funeral.  It was nice that we didn't feel that time was up after we finished eating.  Although we were too full for dessert we stayed to have another drink and figure out our plans for the next few days.  Lacey did not mind one bit and encouraged us to stay as long as we needed (even after the check was closed)!", "date": "2015-05-27 03:55:41"}, {"_key": "100740", "_id": "reviews/100740", "_rev": "_fNyp7Di--0", "review_id": "KIU4KRsyBY4M5lAu8kLSBg", "user_id": "glbxojHh2gmkFcHWIWnKPw", "business_id": "-mq1DwgcLU96PQbmcv3jRQ", "stars": 2, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Ugh...

I haven't sampled enough yet, to say great.  We stopped in about 11:30am and it was still pretty busy.  Seems to have a lot of regulars. The outside is so unassuming. You would just pass it by if you hadn't heard about from someone else or seen the reviews on Yelp! Like I have for 23 yrs. So we decided to venture in grab some sandwiches and a dozen doughnuts. They still had quite a selection left being close to closing. Reading previous reviews we knew we had to get in early to get more of a vast array of a selection. Hey, it's Saturday and we wanted to sleep in !\n\nThe sandwiches where very hearty and filled.\n\nThe Club on white bread : The bacon was not just made. Probably made earlier in the morning. We can forgive that. The meat was good. The veggies were fresh and crisp. Overall a 3 out of 5 sandwich\n\nThe Strange Bird on wheat: Think Thanksgiving sandwich. The cranberry sauce had actual cranberries.  The cream cheese was very good. The turkey average. Veggies crisp and tasty. The hero's of the sandwich were the cream cheese and the cranberry sauce.  3 out of 5. \n\nThe doughnuts . Wow these are some fancy dougnuts. It's like Willie Wonka opened up a doughnut shop. They have everything from your everyday doughnuts to Key Lime Pie! Valentine's Day is tomorrow so there were of course lots of red and pink frosted ones to choose from.\nThey were, good,sweet, fluffy and all things that one  wishes of a doughnut. Filled with sugary delight.\n\nDefinitely take your kids here and watch them ohhh and ahhh with the different selections.\n\nWe didn't get any bagels this time. I know,  I know, who goes to a bagel shop and doesn't get the bagles. We will next time. You know there's only so many carbs and sugars you can have before you go into shock. \n\nWill definitely update when we do!

I've had pretty much everything on their menu and they have a wide range of breakfast, lunches and dinners to go.

Want something a little heavier? Their cheesesteaks, mac and cheese, or any of their italian dishes, I highly recommend. Whatever you order, the ingredients are high quality and their bread is shipped fresh daily from Statten Island. The staff is super friendly and very accommodating if you have dietary needs, just ask and they'll make it for you. Also, don't be fooled by the cafeteria style, its a really nice atmosphere, clean, big tvs and a nice little lounge and bar area to enjoy your meals.

The sauce came on the side which I liked, so I could mix it all together in a ratio I liked. \n\nOur server told us they specialize in skewers, so we added an order of beef skewers that were spicy and tender.

The people next to us had steamed bun skewers which looked interesting. \n\nI ordered soft tofu on sizzling plate--the fried tofu in a thin crust came sizzling in a lightly sweet and spicy sauce--the sauce was boiling when it came to the table--with some peas and diced carrots on top. The peas and carrots were hard for me to eat with chop sticks, but I managed fine. Not sure if forks are available or not. \n\nMy son got cumin calamari fried rice (note: calamari is spelled calamay on the menu).

That, plus a short bar, plus a corner kitchen area, constitutes the entire restaurant.\n\nIt's quite dark inside, with tabletop candles and Spanish music playing in the background - perfect for a first date, a hundredth date, or drinks with close friends and co-workers. Not, on the other hand, a family-friendly restaurant; I wouldn't recommend bringing any children here.\n\nThe wine list was quite extensive, as I expected it to be, and offered a variety of by-the-glass choices, and just as many by-the-bottle options. I tasted two red wines during my visit: the Ben Marco Malbec, Argentina (hints of blackcurrant and slightly acidic) and the Pasion Brava Tempranillo (Rioja), Spain (much sweeter, very smooth drinking). No matter your wine preference, Tzin has a variety of options to suit every taste, and the excellent service ensures that your wine glass is always topped up.\n\nTzin offers a typical tapas-style menu: a selection of small-ish dishes with a strong foundation in Spanish cuisine. Diners can either select several to share amongst their party, or choose one or two for themselves. Everything (and I mean everything) sounded delicious, so it was difficult to make a decision.\n\nIn the end, I decided to try the Olive Plate to start, since I love pairing marinated olives with wine. Alongside the olives, the plate boasted a selection of focaccia bread, olive tapenade, and a dish of olive oil and balsamic vinegar, all of which were delectable. The warm marinated olives were delicious and went extremely well with my glass of Ben Marco.\n\nFor dinner, we decided to order separate dishes, and opted for the Chorizo and Gnocchi Stew and the Chicken Breast Supreme. The stew, served with grilled flat bread, was absolutely heavenly and had a weighty tomato taste that complemented the manchego gnocchi and chorizo exceptionally well. The chicken breast dish was moist and tender, and was served on a bed of harissa couscous and dried apricots, with a dollop of minted yoghurt. Harissa is a Tunisian hot chili sauce, so the couscous understandably had a bit of a kick to it; if you don't like spicy foods, I'd advise you not to choose this dish. The spiciness isn't overpowering, but it'll set your mouth tingling if you eat enough of the couscous.\n\nWe had excellent service throughout our entire visit - the server was very friendly and accommodating - and enjoyed the chic d\u00e9cor, open-style kitchen, and gigantic wine rack (my next purchase).\n\nOne of the things I like best about Tzin is that they're all about the dining experience. This restaurant is about relaxing, enjoying a good glass of wine, and sampling delicious appetizers and tapas plates. They're a hole-in-the-wall restaurant simply for this reason; if they were to enlarge the space and cram in as many tables as possible, they'd lose much of the charm they get from the currently intimate, personal dining experience. \n\nIf you work downtown, if you enjoy wine and tapas, or, hell...if you live in Edmonton...you need to make a date to visit Tzin sometime soon. As I've said, and as their website stresses, they're a small restaurant, so please make the most of OpenTable and book yourself a place. Then all you need to do is sit back, quaff some wine, nibble on an appetizer, and simply experience.", "date": "2013-10-11 20:52:28"}, {"_key": "100950", "_id": "reviews/100950", "_rev": "_fNyp7Dy--O", "review_id": "j4XBSS2GXyN0oy27klGIfg", "user_id": "h4ZqDUqVcektL45xG4QDew", "business_id": "dNR-b-CsrFGYhMo9zLMrCw", "stars": 4, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "I've been spoiled by St. Louis' Seoul Taco but when in Rome...\n\nClean little establishment, short easily-legible menu hanging on the wall, friendly girl at the front register where you order deli-style. \n\nBibimbap - Authentic Korean dish served over rice, topped with saut\u00e9ed vegetables, sliced marinated beef, fried egg, and topped with gochujang.

Nothing too terribly creative, but the ingredients are solid and the food tastes good. We started with the 1-1-1 app which comes with a fried oyster, a fried chicken liver, and a duck eggroll (of course, fried). The liver is probably the best followed by the eggroll. Of course, I got the barbecue shrimp which is apparently the house specialty. I think I had 6 huge shrimps in my order along with 3 slivers of french bread and plenty of that amazing sauce. The experience is what makes it fun. You get a bib, a plate for the shells/heads, and an extra napkin - this is NOT a clean dining experience. Your fingers get covered with the sauce and in between shrimp pieces you lick the sauce off of your fingers and dip that bread into it! There's really no secret as to why it tastes so good - it's called BUTTER, and lots of it! Regardless of caloric complications and possibly accelerating your heart disease just a little - the dish is pretty damn delicious. Afterwards, they squeeze some lemon over your hands and give you a nice hot towel to wipe off with - all meals should end this way! My friend got the filet and it was cooked well but really nothing incredible. The gumbo was decent but not a show stopper like the shrimp.\n\nAmbience/ Music: A three piece classic old jazz band with stand up bass, banjo, and clarinet (nice touch)! Oh the lead singer/banjo player is blind - which is pretty impressive to see. The waiters are all dressed up in their pseudo-tuxedos and the restaurant has a classic old-school upscale vibe - nothing gaudy or ostentatious. Very laid back cool but with class. Music was never too loud for our group so that we could carry a conversation without yelling. However, we were more towards the outside edge of the main dining room so, perhaps, it is louder in the middle. \n\nService: Decent, probably the weakest part of the overall experience but really no gross negligence or injustice was done. There were a older more 'career' type waiter who initially took our orders, but intermittently we were waited on by some younger guys who - while enthusiastic - weren't the most knowledgable or experienced in the art of waiting tables. I've had better, and, definitely had much worse. \n\nOverall: great place to go for a CASUAL jazz brunch in the quarter. It's not the best at everything but if you have some picky eaters, a larger group, can't get a reservation elsewhere, or just want something laid back where you could wear a T-shirt and jeans and be let in the door - this is a good option for solid food. It ran us about $50 a person for basically an app, entree, and 2 drinks each - not bad but not as good a deal as Commander's IMO. \n\nFood Area Code: 857 (Food, Service, Ambience)", "date": "2013-06-24 21:43:21"}, {"_key": "101020", "_id": "reviews/101020", "_rev": "_fNyp7ES--S", "review_id": "Nrrx-57DuhSmVEx66sPGwQ", "user_id": "uH_hzywcwxlo5UAl_FtDVA", "business_id": "KZe5kpIHWVuJl6WgNYzceg", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "A little hole in the wall type place for the area it's in.

First impression was confusion with two entrances and people did not know where the line formed. If you want to order breakfast, coffee, wine, you stand in the front line. If you want to order a salad, walk to the back of the restaurant. If you want to order prepared foods for later, walk to the back of the restaurant. No signage or direction was really given.\n\nOrdered the fried prosciutto sandwich with spinach and poached egg with a side of parmesan potatoes. The hizzy (husband) got the brunch burrito and jalapeno grits. I asked for hot sauce and was told to go to the front to get it. Very inconvenient. They only have ONE bottle of hot sauce for the whole restaurant by the entrance. Not even by the eating area. And it was empty.  While my fresh food sat at the table 75 feet away, I had to wait for someone to refill that bottle. Like had to go to the back and refill. No extra bottles anywhere. The sides were both delicious! Although, jalapeno grits need some spice. I tasted no jalapeno. False advertisement. The potatoes were yum. My sandwich was less than desirable. Not very flavorful. The burrito was very good! Meat filled and a good blend of flavors. Prices were affordable. The huz thought they could have charged more for the burrito, but was happy they did not.\n\nThe chairs and tables are so pretty, but the chairs are too short for the tables. Now, I am short so this is exaggerated for someone like me. My husband who is almost 6' tall felt the same way. He actually mentioned it first. It is nice to have pretty decor, but utility should be first for a restaurant. We did not like the flow of the space. That line is really blocking the rest of the restaurant off. It was just awkward. \n\nParking is definitely an issue, but if I lived close by, I would totally walk in for a salad or prepared meal.

Spacious hardwood tables greet you as you walk in, with reservations available. You sign up at the counter and are free to float between tables, with your entry fee and all consumables paid for at the end of your visit.\n\nThe most attractive feature of TTC is the large boardgame collection as well as the flat $5/day for all-day gaming ($2.50/hr at rival Hexagon Caf\u00e9 on Whyte). The customer service is efficient and polite, but not necessarily friendly. Orders may not be taken from tables generally. You must make your way up to the counter and interrupt play (or hope there isn't a queue after taking your turn in your game). \n\nLong hours (up to 1am on Friday and Saturday night) are quite a delight as you may choose whenever is convenient for you to go solo or with a group of friends. Despite my belief that this out of the way location would be an issue for most gamers (as many are not vehicle owners), I was pleasantly surprised that the location is only a 5 minute walk from a #8 stop. \n\nAs with most boardgame caf\u00e9s, TTC suffers from more emphasis on the boardgame and not enough on the caf\u00e9.

I stayed at the Hilton for a business meeting in New Orleans and my associate made a reservation at L\u00fcke raving about the place. Naturally, I was skeptical. \n\nThe restaurant is on the ground floor of the Hilton in St. Charles St. in downtown \"Nawlins',\" as it's called. I'm from Ohio -- so, needless to say, I was on the search for some great creole and cajun food.\n\nIt was fantastic!!! We had a small group, so we started with the cold seafood platter with oysters, clams, crab, shrimp, and mussels; and an assortment of pate, cheese and bread. WOW. Obviously the fresh oysters were fresh from the gulf -- you could taste it! The texture was light and ever-so-slightly salty. The other seafood was okay, so if I had to choose again, I'd just get more oysters. Great cold seafood bar! The rabbit pate was pretty good too, so be adventurous and try a few different items!\n\nI had recently made Shrimp and Grits at home, therefore decided to see what they actually tasted like in New Orleans. Not bad - mine were better. I think it's mostly because I liked my grits a little creamier. Theirs were lumpy and slightly dry. The shrimp were perfectly cooked and seasoned with what tasted like a little blackened seasoning. I prefer a more tomato and garlic approach. Nonetheless, they were still tasty and delicious.\n\nAgain, since I was jonesin' for some cajun food, I had a cup of seafood gumbo as a side. Whoooowheeee, awesome!  It was very flavorful and had a decent amount of seafood. The bowl was completely empty... \n\nThe service was impeccable on the Monday night I visited. The server was attentive and very helpful with recommendations. \n\nI recommend you sit in the back of the place near the kitchen, which is enclosed on 3 sides by glass, so you can see all the action!

He noticed that I have eaten here twice a day and we got to talking. His family was there eating as mine was and he is extremely professional in a most personal way. OK two suggestions. Staff, announce loudly, \"Welcome to honeygrow!\" even when it's my 50th time there. I should be welcoming them since they know the place less than I do since they obviously don't recognize me as the most frequently seen patron. So I'm just asking that corporate tones that down a bit? It's not just that I'm off put by it but half the people coming into honeygrow are in conversation while walking in or on their phones (their prerogative) and its actually mildly disruptive. Greeting customers a certain way shouldn't be a corporate policy unless you fine tune it a bit. Ask greeters to be a little more diplomatic in their approach. The store is loud because of the layout which is no problem but it results in having greeters shout out, \"Welcome to honeygrow!\" See how saying, \"Welcome to honeygrow!\" gets old quickly just by hearing it or seeing it written over and over in this review. Just sayin'...OK one other more amusing pet peev. So in the men's bathroom there is a nice braille sign that says, of course, \"Employees must wash hands.\" No problem with that, I  assume it's a health code thing. But hilarious is the fact that the sign is framed and encased in glass. Hoping you get the irony but apparently not. Blind people can't read braille if the sign is covered in glass. Do I have to spell that out. Here it is in braille, \"Blind people can't read braille covered in glass.\" Welcome to honeygrow! I'm just teasing you honeygrow and I know you can take it because you're a great restaurant and you're going places and you've mastered the market of bringing slow food to fast food. Damn I should have gone into advertising. There's a slogan in there somewhere. John Watson the father of Psychology made millions on Madison Ave after his successful career as a psychologist. As an addiction psychologist in Bala Cynwyd if I get tired of my day job helping people with drug and alcohol addiction I'll go into advertising or restaurant ergonomics or at least writing reviews. So last piece to the long winded story. I did share my concerns about the blind patrons in the men's room and an earnest and well meaning employee suggested that you couldn't work at a place like honeygrow if you were blind because it requires an ability to handle many small items of food and preparation and hot stove cooking.

The server was slow and only came by the table 3 times: to take our order, give our food, and give the check. 2. The bub holes (homemade donut holes) were forgotten, so we reminded a random waiter because we didn't see ours.

When I mentioned we never got the bub holes, she said \"well they should be coming out soon.\" so we waited....and finally they came out (assuming she forgot to put in the order). When we tried them, they were rock hard. Donuts should not be rock solid. 3. I asked for an over-easy egg on the side and it came completely cooked through. Dipping the sausage in the yolk is the best part! 4. When the waitress asked how we liked it, I told her we waited a little too long for the donut holes.

Unfortunately I don't think I got a pick a of the prices, but basically you get about an 8-10 inch pizza with all the toppings of your choice, for about $9. The kids pizzas come with drinks and are about $5 give or take. The time to actually cook your pizza is magical as well. Yes, I know I said magical lol. Basically as you are paying your pizza will probably be completed. I have no idea how they do it but they do and it's really heaven. \n\nSo my daughter had the standard cheese pizza which was good. Pepperoni was too. I had the meats option which was tasty as well. We also tried this pizza with chicken, white sauce, mozzarella, artichokes, pesto, and garlic (oh btw, get the garlic. Get lots of it. Trust me on this). This pizza was so out of the norm for my normal pizza but it was so good! \n\nHonestly, to me the only thing that could've been better was the customer service. There was one particular guy, I think he may have been a manager, that was just going way too fast. Like, I get that it's a fast place, but don't be so rushed while I give you my ingredients that you end up putting something on my pizza that I didn't want. Also, he seemed to have an attitude while speaking with customers.

The cruise costs $28.50, and for $11 more you can get lunch, which I did.\n\nAbout five minutes before boarding an old lady on the top deck started belting out a deafening version of \"Pennies from Heaven\" on the calliope, which I think was intended to let the passengers know we were about to leave. There must have been a couple of hundred other people taking the tour, so I assumed it had to be reasonably good. \n\nI was wondering why they allowed 30 minutes for boarding, and found out as I got close to the front of the line. There were a few of crew near the gangway taking the obligatory cheesy tourist photo. Honestly, will I fall for this again? Probably...\n\nThey pointed the passengers who'd paid for lunch straight into the dining room, which takes up most of the first deck. They give you a little laminated card that says \"Occupied\" which you put on your table while you browse the buffet. I was greeted by a very friendly lady called Gina as soon as I entered. She settled me in, got me an iced tea, and replaced my bread pudding dessert as she said the first bit was a little bit burnt. How lovely!\n\nThe buffet included beans and rice, sausages, some salads, fried catfish and corn bread. Iced tea and iced water is also included in the price, but if you want anything else from the full bar that runs along one wall of the restaurant, you have to pay extra. The catfish was actually really good, and I liked the corn bread too, but the bread pudding was deserving of seconds. Tasted like the steamed pudding I used to have when I was a kid.\n\nThere was a good jazz band called The Steamboat Stompers playing at one end of the room when I entered. They politely stopped when the captain started his commentary. The Natchez is actually the sixth or seventh reincarnation of the original 19th century vessel and is only 40 years old, however the engines came from the tow boat Clairton and date from 1910. It's one of only two steamboats still operating in the US.\n\nGina took my photograph next to the window above the paddle wheel with the New Orleans skyline reflected in the glass, then I went up to the top deck where they have a gift shop. \n\nWe sailed seven miles up the Mississippi passed the site of the Battle of New Orleans where the Americans defeated the British in 1815, thus ending the War of 1812. I could see the white obelisk of the monument commemorating the battle over the top of the levee.\n\nBought a drink from the Texas Bar on the upper deck and sipped it at a table by the railing under the canopy. The jazz band had started playing again and a cool breeze was coming down the river. Very pleasant. Finished my drink and relocated to the rear upper deck, which also has a small bar. Ordered a Bacardi and coke and watched the river roll by. I can think if a lot worse ways to spend a couple of hours than drifting down the Mississippi in an old paddle steamer.

Both of us decided to get a couple of salads. My mom's Caesar was drenched in dressing on the 4 romaine leaves that consisted of. My Caprese was very old mozzarella and a very garlicky vinaigrette which was more garlic and oil than anything else. Major disappointment.\n\nThe entrees were actually not much better.

Mike loves grits done the \nthe old fashion southern way like how his great Aunt made it.  The grits here were rich smooth creamy and satisfying.  But the shrimps with bacon with the red eye sauce is what shined.  I practically licked the plate.  We also ordered gumbo ya ya and crab cake on a bed of Maque Choux.  I could'nt finish everything but the maque choux was so delicious I had to scoop up the remainder to go so I could enjoy later.\n\nFor dessert we enjoyed the mixed berry cobbler. It was a very memorable meal.\n\nI was here with my sister and her family 3 years ago for Thanksgiving and although we all did not order the traditional Thanksgiving meal, we all shared the different dishes and were completely happy with what we had.\n\n\nThis is an update I need to mention:\n\nUpon arriving home and and later checking our credit card statement for which we used to pay our tab, we found that the waiter that served us took it upon himself to add a couple of bucks plus to his tip on our credit card after we had already signed our credit card slip.  We were more than appropriate with his tip. Maybe most people don't compare their signed slips with their CC statements and they can get away with this. I know it's just a couple of dollars but this practice is soooo unethical. \n\nI have been to Mr.B's a handful of times when visiting and have been happy with the food and service but this has really tarnished it for me.

Growing up near Philly, we have admired the building from afar. As we rode the private elevator to the 137th floor, our expectations were high - and the staff didn't let us down! \n\nThe Valentines Dinner was a set menu. The servers asked that we order our appetizer, entree, and dessert at the same time. With so many guests for the holiday, it was a wise decision for the evening. It was difficult to choose because everything sounded so delicious. Where else can you get shrimp cocktail AND lobster for your appetizer? I could have ate just that and been satisfied. The courses came out in a timely fashion, everything was the right temperature and cooked exactly how we asked. My husband had the veal and I had the steak. We caught each other chewing with our eyes closed and a big smile after every delicious bite to fully enjoy every moment. \n\nDuring our meal, we received a complimentary appetizer and dessert. This was way more than expected and I was especially excited because I had trouble choosing between two desserts. The free dessert was actually my second choice, which I happily devoured as well. The Assistant General Manager, Brittney, approached our table and asked about our experience. With full bellies and smiles from ear to ear, we could not stop talking about how amazing the food and service was. But there was one problem - we wanted to get a photo of us with the beautiful Philadelphia skyline below, but we did not want to interrupt other customers dinners. When we mentioned this to Brittney, she personally took us to a private room so that we could get our picture taken. Just like how everything else in the restaurant was above and beyond, Brittney took the time to take several photos with and without flash, horizontal and vertical, just to make sure we were happy. I must say, we are more than happy! We were treated like we were the only guests in the restaurant and we are already talking about coming back for happy hour ASAP! \n\nFYI if you are considering reservations for  next year - The reservation process for Valentines Dinner was different than I have experienced. When we called in December, we were put on a list of callbacks for when they opened the books   for 2/14 in January. When we were called back, we were asked to make a $50 deposit to reserve a table (which went to our total bill at the end). That is totally understandable considering the type of place and popularity of the night! \n\nAlso there is a full-size mirror in the restrooms so that you can snap a selfie in your fancy attire. If I could give this restaurant 10 stars, I would.

Szechuan is very spicy Chinese food where you'll see plates where it looks like all peppers but food is buried in it. Szechuan house tones it down a little. Now this is different than most peppers that just burn you, Szechuan is said to burn but then numb and then makes you want more. I can't say I have specifically felt this but others I have gone to Szechuan House with have experienced this and ate more and loved it. This is also a place for adventurous eaters as they have menu items that you cannot find on most Chinese menus and items you may find bizarre but for most Asian eaters they are not. You can explore on your own. You know a good restaurant by its clientele, on most nights there are all Asians and their families eating there so that is good. I am Chinese but my Caucasian friends were definitely in the minority.\n\nThe exterior of the restaurant may look a little dated but you are here for the food right? And the food is really quite good. The go to every time is the Chongqing Spicy Crispy Chicken under the Chendu Classics on the menu. Nicely crisp pieces of chicken smothered in peppers, to me not burn your mouth off hot but a nice heat. Now I am not a huge fried rice guy not but I really really like their fried rice. It has its own flavor that I enjoy so these two are always a must have. One thing with me, even with fried rice I have to have a bowl of white rice this helps with some of the heat while eating the szechuan dishes.\n\nI am a huge fan of beef chow fun (a wide noodle) but it has to be done right with a chewier texture and cooked really brown. This chow fun is a bit more soft and not as brown so not a big fan here. We also had a whole fish cooked with Szechuan sauce but this I would not recommend because of the bones. Most fish you can separate the flesh from the bones easily bit this was a gloopy hot pot of fish and spices so the bones were difficult to deal with. Better to go with a filet or fish cubes. Otherwise it was still tasty.\n\nWe have also had the peking duck which comes with the bun wrappers and scallion and hoisin sauce and although delicious it is $32 and you maybe got 6-7 small wraps out of it. If you've never had it worth a try just to say you've had it.

The interior of the restaurant itself isn't great--the lighting is weird (sort of a muted fluorescent?), and the tabletops are plastic--but there was nothing really \"wrong\" with it and we were plenty comfortable.\n\nIf I lived closer to KOP, I'd probably hit it up again for takeout.

We were the first to arrive, so we were immediately seated in the area across from the bar.  The restaurant was very stylish yet inviting.  \n  We also had great service with a combination of friendliness and knowledge that I wish more restaurants had.  After all, the social aspect of dining with friends can be as key to enjoying the evening as the food.\n  After ordering our beverages, we were brought a small cup of Sancocho as an amuse bouche.  I am not familiar with the item, but the flavor reminded me of tasty bean broth.  \n  We then shared a guacamole for the table.  Excellent flavor combination in the guac.  My wife, who normally doesn't care for avocado, even thought it was good!  The chips that came with the guac were light, but crisp enough to scoop.\n  I ordered the \"De Palmitos\" salad (hearts of palm, field greens, roasted walnuts, butternut squash, hibiscus-lemon vinaigrette).  It was my first time trying hearts of palm, so having all these other delicious flavors gave me confidence to try something new.  I was very pleased.\n  Finally, I ordered the Pescado Zarandeado (it comes without the fish head....I asked.)  The sea bass was colored/flavored with green and red achiote which made for a nice presentation.  Very tasty.  The fish came with black beans and white rice to fill out the entree.  \n  With the great atmosphere, service, and food, it was plain to see why this restaurant was voted one of the Top 5 restaurants in Indy.

I love this place. That being said, it's not without its faults -- faults that are more and more turning people off -- and I hope they work on fixing them. \n\nThe Good:\n--Holy crap the decor is amazing. Not one single detail was overlooked at this place (even the trash cans are adorable!), and that, to me, makes a huge difference. I'll happily pay $15 for a slice of cake if it's delicious AND I feel like I'm having an experience, rather than eating a delicious piece of cake in a soulless box. And boy is this an experience. You really do feel like you stumbled upon a quaint French bakery. There's literally nothing else like this in the city. I cannot rave about this enough.\n\n--The dessert. Mostly. I've been four times: the first time was mind blowing. The second time was amazing. The third time was good but starting to slack, and the fourth time was... meh. The cake slices are expensive, but the portions are huge. I can put away some food, but I've never finished an entire slice, so think of it as paying for 2-3 servings of dessert. The icing on the black and white cake is not so great -- it's thick and generous, but mostly flavorless. \n\n--The food. I've done lunch there three times, and mostly it's great. Again, it's expensive -- but this time the portions aren't generous. Think a half sandwich (but a true half, not an oversized Indiana half), a small cup of soup, and a few forkfuls of salad. This is a great place to go for nibbles, but not so excellent if you're actually famished. \n\nThe Meh\n--THE SERVICE. Holy God, someone please train the girls that work there. They are terrible. Even their adorable pink aprons won't distract you from the truly terrible service. Every time I've been, I've had to actually instruct them to remove the empty plates and dishes after they've brought the new plates and dishes to the table, and even when I asked them to take away the plates, they looked at me as if they were incredibly confused. Once we ordered mimosas and were told it would be a few minutes while they juiced the oranges, which they said they hadn't done yet because they \"just opened.\" We were there 45 minutes after opening, and it seems to be that perhaps a few oranges should be ready to prepare for the brunch crowd. In the end, we waited 30 minutes for that mimosa, and there was only the tiniest amount of orange juice in it. We actually got out entire brunch because the drink. Not okay. \n\n--The food. Yes, I know I put this in the good column earlier because it is mostly good, but it's starting to slack. The vinaigrette in my salad was incredibly tart and super salty, like someone accidentally dumped an extra cup of salt into the mix. Quiche arrived cold (and it was not supposed to be). The tomatoes on the caprese salad were mushy and flavorless. (If tomatoes aren't good that day/week, just don't serve them as an option.)\n\n-The cost. I don't mind because I'm okay with paying for an \"experience,\" but lunch for two (soup and salad), plus a soda and two slices of cake will easily put you over $40.\n\nStill, I'll go back.

Been meaning to come here for awhile. The bartender whose name I forgot to ask was amazing. Literally the only save after my experience downstairs and the only reason I'll ever eat at Felipe's again.

Honestly, will come back but 75% of the reason to see the bartender again. \n\nA year later.... wow. What happened to you guys? You guys updated the menu again by removing more items. It didn't exactly speed up the service. The best thing about the place is Michael, which was the only reason we came back, and to our dismay got stuck in a booth. Not that it mattered, he was so overworked and understaffed he wouldn't have been chatty and witty anyway. Another guy was there. Red shirt. Middle aged. Clearly worked there. I use that term loosely. He was only interested in other tables, literally every single other table besides ours until we ordered a $40 drink. Then we warranted passing attention. Shame it took thirty minutes to get that drink and another fifteen for the second and final drink. Seriously, get more staff. I'll probably be back but I'll call ahead to see who's working and if there's not room at the bar, I'll just go to Lucy's on Tchoupitoulas.

We showed up about ten minutes early to our reservation and grabbed a drink at the bar.  The drinks were pretty much par for any upscale restaurant's bar...a bit pricey and good but nothing clever or great.  The atmosphere of the bar is a bit crowded making it loud and a little unpleasant.  Still, the clientele and the bar itself was nice so this wasn't a big deal.\n\nWhen we were seated, I was FREEZING.  I thought it was from my martini, but  I realized about half way through my meal when I stood up to navigate the corn maze to the bathroom downstairs that there was a vent blowing freezing cold air right above me.  Oh well.  On to the food....\n\nI started with Gumbo Ya-Ya, which is this places staple.  It did for sure live up to all it's hype.  I'm no gumbo expert but this had a delicious, rich and smoky flavor, that was very well contrasting with the natural sweetness of the chicken and broth.  It balanced smoky, salty, and sweet in excellent layers.  I ordered a scallops appetizer because I didn't want anything fried (seriously what's the deal...only like 1/7 appetizers wasn't fried).  I knew my entree would be heavy so I opted for this, and it wasn't a great dish.  The fried oysters and shrimp were much more flavorful.\n\nMy entree was the braised rabbit which was a really nice dish.  It was almost unfairly sweet and about half way through it it just felt like I was forking through molasses.  I really was moving at a New Orleans pace.  I think this might have worked better as an appetizer because at this quantity it felt like there was no beginning and no end.  The bacon and mashed potatoes were delicious, but were all hampered by a very very sweet and thick sauce.  The filet was okay (but nothing great), and the fish of the day was pretty nice, but also nothing great, from trying off of other plates.\n\nOverall, I think the food was four stars, but the limited dishes under 5,000 calories, the packed bar, and the freezing cold atmosphere detracted a star from my review.", "date": "2010-12-01 16:11:39"}, {"_key": "101975", "_id": "reviews/101975", "_rev": "_fNyp7Fa--S", "review_id": "V4jm9nrecaSNQe5LHpNt8w", "user_id": "iogZ2hoLzhbO3WykA2JClA", "business_id": "oaboaRBUgGjbo2kfUIKDLQ", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Ice cream is pretty good and the espresso is ok.

My son ordered one of the platters with chocolate chip pancakes, scrambled eggs and two meats (bacon and sausage).  I ordered the eggs Benedict which came with Hashbrowns.  \n\nFirst, let me start off with the place was packed.  The parking lot was full, the restaurant crowded, yet we were sat right away and the waitress was very prompt in greeting us and getting our drink order.  In fact she was one of the best servers I've had in a while.  She paid attention to when our drinks started to get low (I had hot tea and she got me more hot water before I had to ask), and checked on us just enough times.  \n\nMy eggs Benedict was great.  The hashbrowns could have been seasoned, but ham was flavorful.  It tastes like it had been grilled on an open grill, and the hollandaise sauce was plentiful.  I tasted the chocolate chip pancakes and they were fluffy and sweet without tasting like a candy bar.  \n\nThe only \"bad\" part of this review is that a teenager in line to pay with her family (we were seated near the register) had the music on her phone extremely loud and the owner/manager came up to my teenage son and asked him to turn it down.  My son politely told him it wasn't him, and the owner immediate apologized and we all laughed it off.  \n\nWe came back same day for dinner.  My son got the Cajun burger, we got waffle fries with cheese and ranch, and I got the open faced hot turkey sandwich with stuffing and mashed potatoes.\n\nMy son inhaled the burger so I'm assuming it was good.  The fires were tasty and you could tell they were homemade.  The ranch wasn't my favorite, but I'm a fan of hidden valley, so that's more of a personal preference thing.\n\nThe bread on my sandwich was slightly sweet, but tastes great with the stuffing.  The gravy needed a little bit more flavor, but I am partial to my moms turkey gravy, so I cannot fault the diner.  The only issue is that there was paper in my sandwich.  It appears the cooks missed removing the paper from the meat slices.  That was discouraging because we had such a great experience for breakfast.  The waitress did give us our dessert on the House, which I appreciated.

See, I always feel like a moose woman in a china shop anyway, or I'm carrying a huge bag that I'm trying not to hit into people with, or I just generally have some other ridiculous issue where a tiny shop can gimme a panic. So, the point is: ahhhh spread out a little. It's the same delicious vegan fast food stylins and salads from your original HipCityVeg; now with more leg room. \n\nAlso, here's another thing, a sidenote to all this limited seating talk. I love the hell outta that udon salad, but I'm one of these people who seem to take forever to eat a damn salad. I have felt much anxiety, self-consciously imagining that those waiting to score my seat are hissing at me in their minds, \"Jeeeeezus, just will this one just take it to go already.\" Neuroses. So you understand what I'm saying. You can at salads at your leisure, or enjoy sweet potato fries and crispy, crispy nuggets at their peak crispiness. Or both. Makes such a difference, I tell you: a lil extra space and maximum crispiness.\n\nSpeaking of making a difference- when they take the time to griddle a little char onto that seitan in the udon salad, I love that. It really gives the protein that grilly somethin somethin. I love it that this arrugula-y salad it's an actual greens-packed salad with noodles in it, rather than, you know, a bigg asss noodle bowl with some greens fluttered lightly in. Listen, I'm all for extra noodle, but, ya know, sometimes your trying to do a thing. Anyway, I enjoy this dish, I do, even if it could use a little less dressing at times. I'm not complaining bout that though, really. So tasty.\n\nIn closing, I'd like to repeat the announcement that the Crispy HipCity Ranch remains my favorite, favorite. It cures a chicken sandwich yen for me, maybe better than a real bird sandwich, even. I have real HipCityVeg hankerings and I find myself coming up with more reasons to head West to University City.

It was our NYE dinner and I was really looking forward to it.  The ambiance was great, but the set menu for NYE was really lackluster and I wish I had known when I made the reservation that the regular menu wouldn't be available.  Unfortunately, I only found out when they called to confirm the day before. \n\nStarters: celery root soup (good, but lacked seasoning - more salt, more pepper, maybe some heat) and the tuna tartare (fine cut of fish, but really really bland - more soy, more heat, more wasabi, more avocado, more anything).\n\nSecond courses: pesto pasta with crab (good; probably one of the best things we ate); pork belly (also good - huge hunk of belly and the sauce, for once, had great flavor); octopus (tough, overpowered by the other things on the dish).\n\nEntrees: chicken (really really good, especially for a chicken dish) and the cod (couldn't eat the skin, as it was soft, rubbery, and really fishy; once I got to the fish itself, it was good, but still just kind of meh).  \n\nDessert: the chocolate nutella bomb (meh, it's chocolate) and the salted caramel creme (really tasty, but really rich). \n\nFood would probably give this place three stars, but I'm taking off a star for the way the meal went.  \n\nWe sat down and were immediately greeted by our service (very pleasant man).  And we told him we'd like to start with two glasses of champagne.  They come out timely.  We take a sip and provide the server with our orders from the set menu.  We have mayyyyybe drank 1/4 of our glass of champagne and we are given our first wines (we did the wine pairing) and our first courses.  O....kay.  Usually when the diners start with the champagne, you wait for them to finish the champagne before bringing them their first course and new wine. \n\nSo, we kind of drank our champagne along with the meal.  Then, all the courses came out REALLY quickly.  I get it, it's a set menu, your kitchen is just firing out the meals.  But COME ON. Let us savor and enjoy one course before being immediately served with the second course.  We couldn't finish our entrees, because we were given them less than four minutes after finishing the second courses.  Then, at the end of the meal, my BF left for the restroom and the check was brought out about thirty seconds after he left.  I'm all for paying the check (I paid for Husk the night before), but come on, don't bring out the check when one person JUST left for the restroom.  \n\nAll in all, we felt VERY rushed and were out of the restaurant within an hour.  For a nice restaurant, we felt that they cared more about seating as many people as possible and not for obtaining any return customers.  \n\nAgain, I wish they had their original menu.  From the reviews, I was really looking forward to the meal.  But the set menu and the rushed service that accompanied it...really ruined what could have been a lovely meal in a beautiful dining room.", "date": "2017-01-03 19:22:54"}, {"_key": "102423", "_id": "reviews/102423", "_rev": "_fNyp7Ga--G", "review_id": "rFoLZ5gytBjY3lhp5WcvxQ", "user_id": "5LDLQIPPRMG7kXLhF1P4xQ", "business_id": "V6Om7YZhlRQRU7WfuxHq8Q", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This is actually my 2nd time eating here.

However, my complaints are these:\n\n(1) The line is always ridiculously long during busy times (lunch hour and after work), and line moves really really really slow. It kind of takes the fun out of it when it takes 20-25 minutes to get to the front of the line. I feel that if they're truly interested in running it like a fast food joint, then the lines should move quicker (open up 2 more cashier spots). And if they can't do that, they should offer people seating and waiters. As someone who has been there probably 20+ times since the opening 5 weeks ago, I can tell you the lines are getting pretty old, pretty fast.\nThe \"extra\" employee who stands by the door welcoming people can be put to better use. They are supposed to help by explaining the menu to people - but my initial analysis is that this never makes the line moves faster. People still get to the front and spend forever asking the cashier about the dishes. And, no, the menu is not simple or self-explanatory.\n\n(2) For the Rewards program, you have to tell the cashier your phone number every single time you go in. If you read my first point above, you will realize that the cashier area is usually crowded with hungry people impatiently waiting to order, and basically leaning in listening to what you're saying to said casher. This is a small restaurant to begin with. Therefore, I always feel uncomfortable saying my number to the cashier, who invariably cannot hear, and has to repeat loudly - usually several times over -- while multiple patrons have now tuned in. There MUST be a better way, c'mon now.\n\nThe food is good, don't get me wrong.", "date": "2015-04-29 15:10:37"}, {"_key": "102565", "_id": "reviews/102565", "_rev": "_fNyp7Gi--V", "review_id": "1hZ_trVElUxNNf5hAj1ePA", "user_id": "Nh_TAjL7uKIHBLlzl-gsBg", "business_id": "GV-e7Op4aU98xkjjoKlRhA", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I am usually not a  big tapas fan.

We were all in for a shock tonight. Our waiter was just okay in the beginning, but after what I'm about to mention happened he gave us all some real attitude that deducted from his tip. \n\nThe worst thing thing that can happen when ordering pizza happened...when you receive it it is cold.

Obviously we had it sent back and heated up, and after that any thing we asked for didn't come out for quite a considerable amount of time.

It's just this location (that was opened under panera bread co.) that won't take it.\n\nWhy post the Paradise Bakery sign outside if it's really just Panera.
