The kids pizzas come with drinks and are about $5 give or take. The time to actually cook your pizza is magical as well. Yes, I know I said magical lol. Basically as you are paying your pizza will probably be completed. I have no idea how they do it but they do and it's really heaven. \n\nSo my daughter had the standard cheese pizza which was good. Pepperoni was too. I had the meats option which was tasty as well. We also tried this pizza with chicken, white sauce, mozzarella, artichokes, pesto, and garlic (oh btw, get the garlic. Get lots of it. Trust me on this). This pizza was so out of the norm for my normal pizza but it was so good! \n\nHonestly, to me the only thing that could've been better was the customer service. There was one particular guy, I think he may have been a manager, that was just going way too fast. Like, I get that it's a fast place, but don't be so rushed while I give you my ingredients that you end up putting something on my pizza that I didn't want.

I'm not sure if all Dierbergs have a dine-in area, but they make great lunch spots for eating all of the awesome home cooked food you can get at their deli and sushi bars!\n\nWe like it because Dierbergs deli has a great selection of real food that you can get small portions of and either have them heat it up or you can take it to the little lunch area and heat it up yourself. Most of the time we get either sushi or the baked chicken dinner which for 6 bucks gets you a chicken breast and leg, plus two sides and a dinner roll! Today we opted out of the sushi and went for the chicken as you can see by my before and after pics. Sometimes we get yummy desserts from the deli too.\n\nAnother reason we really like to eat in the store is because it seems like a place that older people, blue collar workers and stay at home mom's like to also have their lunch. Its nice to get out of the office cafeteria and be around something other than your working class lunch crowd at all of the traditional lunch hour spots. It's more like sitting down at a dinner table and taking it easy over some good home cooking.\n\nOne time we'll always remember is when a cute little old man started talking to us as we were getting ready to leave, asking us where we worked and so forth. We told him we worked at a health and medical sciences book publisher and he asked me, oh so you're not a nurse then?

Their food's a little pricey, the inside's a bit pretentious (it is Frontenac / \"Lah-due\" after all), but the patio saves the day.\n\nThe restaurant evokes images of a palatial Tuscan villa (an oxymoron if ever there was one), but they've definitely toned down the Italian flavor for the American palate once you survey the menu.  When you enter they give you the option of dining in the wide, airy (unusually noisy) dining room that's partitioned off by chest high dividers creating various walkways, the bar area (it's a round island style bar), or if the weather's nice the patio.  Go for the patio, people, go for it!\n\nThe patio's much more laid back, quieter and infinitely more enjoyable than the main dining room, which gets a little more than chaotic when they get really busy.  Once seated a bread basket containing flatbreads and warm Sourdough bread will be delivered to the table before taking your order.  The menu is what you might expect for Americanized-Italian: bruschettas and flatbreads abound, classic chopped and Caesar salads are available (as well as some more exotic ones), and pastas, risottos, \"chicken under a brick\" and paninis are all readily available.  Heavy emphasis on the pasta combos.  And the portion sizes?  Ahem... generous, to say the least.\n\nI usually opt to split a salad since half portions of anything are strictly verboten.  My first choice was a safe one: the Romano crusted chicken salad, then I graduated to the Tuscan harvest salad, the Tricolor and the strawberry balsamic chicken.  Of those salads, I generally favor the Tuscan one since it has all kinds of goodies packed into it: mushrooms, bacon, almonds, apples and cranberries in addition to the chicken.  The salads are good - but really, it takes a special restaurant to really screw up a salad, doesn't it?

After awhile, my mind starting asking, \"Why haven't you gone to Mood Cafe?\" So, I finally took these thoughts out of my mind and tried to get my wife to go. At first, she was a skeptic and did not want to go. On my third attempt, she finally gave me the why not approval.\n\nAfter going, we both should be asking, what is wrong with us. This place Amaze! It looks like a small place with not much to offer. The two main menu items are Lassis and Chaat. I've had a Lassi before, and it's always been Mango. But this place had like 25 Lassi flavors. But what is a Chaat I wondered?\n\nThe owner who was working there on our visit explained. There is so much that goes into a Chaat, he lost me somewhere along the way. But what was not lost was my intrigue. I go the Crazy Chicken Chaat. The crazy was their way of saying it's a chicken and beef combo. The beef reminded me of taco meat, but the kind that is seasoned extremely well.\n\nWatching him make the Chaat was like watching an artist. It was like Jackson Pollack at work with the piling on so much stuff. A threw a bunch of stuff down. Then he added 3-4 sauces. He threw more stuff down. Added more sauces. And then he threw more stuff down. Not sure I remember it all, but there was mango, almonds, crispy noodles, dates, potato, and, and, and... yeah that's what I remember. But I know there was more.\n\nWhen I put this goodness in my mouth, it was like a party of flavors. It tasted so fresh and nothing like anything I had tasted before. I was in love.\n\nI also had a peach Lassi which was excellent. My wife had the same dish as me, but got the blueberry Lassi. I liked her Lassi even better.\n\nI so am going back to this place.

I had to click on it-- 100 reviews and 5 stars on Yelp? It seemed too good to be true. I immediately contacted my friend and told her about the place; she was extremely ready to try it as well.\n\nWe ventured into the restaurant at around 7:20 PM. The place is fairly small-- there are only about 3-4 tables. The man who owns the place was incredibly warm, sweet and welcoming. We mentioned that we were newcomers and he immediately wanted to make sure we had a good experience with the food. He asked us for spice preferences and meat preferences for my friend (I told him I was vegetarian from the get-go). The food was made fairly quickly even though there were two parties of four ahead of us. Regardless, the wait time wouldn't make me subtract a star.\n\nThe menu of chaat varieties is extensive; I ordered the veggie chaat (I originally asked for the paneer veggie chaat, but he was out of paneer. Next itme!) The quality of the food was absolutely incredible. The combinations of flavors made each bite exciting and different. The chutneys mixed with the yogurt sauce, the fresh bits of mango pieces, raisins and chick peas and crispy flakes/puris added a cool texture to the dish as well. The play on sweet and savory was so on point. At the end of our meal, the owner told everyone in the restaurant (all tables were full so perhaps about 12 people) that he was heating up gulab jamun (indian sweet) for everyone on the house-- my friend and I were just about to leave and we were so full, but the thought was incredibly sweet and it just added to our experience. Another thing I noticed was that while we were eating, he announced to everyone that he hoped the spices were correct-- he mentioned being able to \"fix it up right away\" if someone had a dish with a spice level that wasn't ideal. So cute! So much appreciation! \n\nThe restaurant also had a huge menu for lassi flavors. I'm not a huge lassi fan, but my friend ordered the Date lassi and really enjoyed it. All the other people in the restaurant ordered a lassi as well, so it is probably a worthwhile choice to complement the chaat.\n\nI paid about $6.50 for my weal, and it was so worth it.

They give you a plastic bib, plastic gloves, a seafood cracker, and a seafood sheller and dump the bag of boiled seafood onto the paper covered table for you to figure out. It was so great! We cracked the crab legs, scooped out the clams and mussels, and peeled the shrimp. It was savory and spicy even with the mild seasoning and I like spice. Loved the sausage and potatoes too! The spice and boil made a kind of broth/sauce and it was delicious dipping the garlic bread in it. Next time I'll try the French fries for dipping purposes.

Undoubtedly the first of many...\n\nFF is an intimate, ~30 seat BYOB on Pine Street, with fairly easy parking at a couple of lots within a few minute walk.  Inside, it's quite charmingly appointed and hits the sweet spot between casual and formal, making it the perfect places for an intimate romantic dinner, or a casual get together with friends over a good bottle of wine.  All the tables are square, white cloth 2-tops, but they can be arranged to accommodate various size groups, including our spacious table for 8.  In contrast to many tiny BYOBs, FF is actually quite roomy--they could probably have squeezed a table or two more, and there is plenty of room to carry on a private conversation or fit your wine and glasses on the table (excellent Guy DeGrenne stems from France).  I think I had 6 glasses in front of me, without problem.\n\nFF has an interesting, short, constantly changing menu (depending on what they have in; and not having either a fridge or freezer, this is an absolute necessity!) divided up into 3 courses of increasing size, each having 4-6 choices, plus a special or two.\n\nWe decided to make things difficult for the staff and came up with our own tasting menu, having bigger dishes plated into smaller individual portions to share, and changing up the order of things to better match the wines we had brought (I've uploaded photos for all the dishes):\n\nBread: Warm rolls, supposedly Parker House-style (although they look more like a muffin) with a crispy exterior and delicate interior, were spread with perfect, lightly salted homemade butter.  After Bibou, the best butter in Philly.\n\nFirst course: Grilled Spanish mackerel, with shaved fennel, warm citrus vinagrette, pine nuts and grainy mustard.  WOW!  Let me repeat this: WOW!!!  The Beet steak gets all the love, but this was the DOTN (dish of the night).  Quite simple to read it, and seemed like a mish-mash of ingredients, but the sum of the parts was knock-your-socks-off.  Each bite was a different experience, citrus one moment, earthy nuts the next.  A lovely match with the SB.\n\n~Preceded by a 1996 Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Champagne Brut La Grande Dame and served with 2009 Merry Edwards Russian River Valley Sauvignon Blanc\n\nSecond course: Handmade pappardelle with Wyebrook Farm pork shoulder ragu, fennel seed and Parmigiano-Reggiano.  An nice dish, with a good porky flavor to the ragu.  I would order it again, but this was probably the least notable of our courses.  However, the 3 Corners was an unbelievably great bottle of Pinot, massive leather & smoke on the nose, midway between New World and Burgundy, with a long, long finish (WOTN).\n\n~Served with 2005 J. Rochioli Pinot Noir Three Corners Vineyard & 2005 J. Rochioli Pinot Noir Little Hill\n\nThird course: Josh's signature dish of bloody beet steak, with yogurt, shallots, pan drippings, aged balsamic and amaranth.  Yes, this is worthy of being a signature dish, with a rich, meaty texture and flavor that prompted us to move it back in the lineup and pair it with a couple of Chateauneuf-du-Papes and a cab (I think the latter was the best match).  But, sorry, I still think that mackerel was The Man!\n\n~Served with 2004 Clos de Papes Chateauneuf-du-Pape & 2003 Domaine du Pegau Chateauneuf-du-Pape (didn't catch the bottling) & 2002 Dominus Napanook Red.  The Pegau was a very fine wine with lots of saddle leather and barnyardy hay on the nose.\n\nFourth course: Rare New York venison with farmer's cheese spaetzel.  This was apparently a entree special for which there were only two plates left, so we split a slice each.  Perfectly tender, perfectly rare, on crispy/chewy spaetzel.\n\n~Served with more of the 3 reds above.\n\nOK, running out of space, so click the link below for Part 2 of my review:", "date": "2012-03-05 00:35:39"}, {"_key": "66824", "_id": "reviews/66824", "_rev": "_fNyp8ye--F", "review_id": "1RbEQsnFgMNR25TcLvKnSA", "user_id": "Il9EB1SLBALhvp7GOVMokw", "business_id": "K8b2MQ5Az59-nzvqUfjJEQ", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Lovely farm-to-table spot that does BYOB. \nDelicious menu - we struggled to do not order everything.

It seems like the combos were not well priced compare to the entrees and personally I would not recommend stir fry dishes that had being sitting out for more than 15 minutes.  I got the entree size xiang la pai gu and it came with a bowl of steamed rice.  I counted 11 meaty ribs pieces  with jalapeno, onions, and dry red chilies.  The sauce was very spicy and flavorful, but I agree with others that it was salty even considering that Sichuan cuisine tends to be heavily seasoned.  Most restaurants use cheaper long grain rice, but here they used starchier short grain rice that Chinese, Korean, and Japanese prefer because sticky short grain rice pick up sauce better than hard fluffy long grain rice.   \n\nI spotted a pan of kou shui ji next to a line of ubiquitous looking stir fries.  I can't help it but get a small box to go.  Kou shui ji literally translates to salivating chicken, so good, you'll salivate thinking about it.  Its boiled whole chicken cut into more manageable chunks, with bones and skins, soaked in a sauce made of spices and red chili oil.  This was not on the menu and it was very good and authentic.  Now, I am definitely intrigued and already planing a future visit.  If they can tone down the sodium by a notch this place would be 4 stars.", "date": "2014-02-24 21:00:54"}, {"_key": "94311", "_id": "reviews/94311", "_rev": "_fNyp9iK--Y", "review_id": "4rSCUYFbiHuCamukAdZ3Jg", "user_id": "Vb3yGDoHB4QrdZfHzEf6ig", "business_id": "MYMLQfzRv8x7aO-bv9vpFg", "stars": 2, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I know these guys have a big following, and I am new to this chain and wanted to give it a go.  \nI showed up at 11:45a .

It was the night of the Super Bowl so we found a restaurant with only two other guests in the dining area and just a handful at the bar. In other words, we had a restaurant to ourselves. Having a restaurant to yourself doesn't guarantee great service, but we got it anyway. Good start so far. Zea Rotisserie and Grill is great option for those looking to take a break from Po' Boys, Jambalaya's, and fried food.  What you'll find is a restaurant chain that serves seafood, sandwiches, Asian based BBQ, grilled food, and of course, rotisserie.  I can almost compare Zea to a Cheesecake Factory, but with a better food presentation and a dining experience that mimics fine dining.   \n\n-Garlic Hummus pita: This was our appetizer for the evening. I haven't had garlic based hummus before and pleased that I did. You still get the texture and taste of what you expect with hummus, but with an added buttery garlic taste to it. There's more hummus than there is pita and they are willing to hook up extra pita if needed.

The ribs are glazed with BBQ sauce and the meat is \"fall off the bone\" and \"melt in your mouth\".  As for their chicken, you get a seasoned and prepared rotisserie chicken.  Taste of their chicken rivals some of the top notch fine dining restaurants out there. Trust me.  (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=QN7x6WC505-ZoDT4ptVHig&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ)\n\nOverall, I have to say that I'm a fan. If I'm ever back out here, I'm sure that my meals will be centered around the foods that I can't get in California or Las Vegas. But if I'm looking for something good, more traditional, and just want a change of pace from NOLA's Southern type dishes, Zea Rotisserie is on my list.\n\n\n\nYELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (034/366)", "date": "2014-02-09 05:40:19"}, {"_key": "106898", "_id": "reviews/106898", "_rev": "_fNyp7L6--a", "review_id": "guoLHryr1WXLWq72mXKO7Q", "user_id": "ZdODEy4O0-nPdPKwkdQkdw", "business_id": "IZmCSGeXLCB-Y2UvJrvr-A", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "Yum!

Also they have free peanuts available for customers. If you have any allergies to peanuts than this place is probably NOT for you. I just thought I would throw in that disclaimer. Another heads up is how busy this place gets. You may have to take your meal to go given the fact that indoor and outdoor seating may be occupied.

It aims to distinguish itself from other burger joints by using very fresh ingredients and serving up many different unusual burgers.  This is not an order-at-the-counter but a sit-down waiter-service operation.   Bareburger is hitting some good notes.  The Elk Burger I had was most excellent - topped as it were with Amish Blue Cheese, bacon & onions, and fig jam.  The elk meat itself was extremely tasty.  However the side I ordered had to be one of the most disappointing sides I've gotten recently in Philadelphia or anywhere.  It was a wasabi carrot slaw that sounded so good and tasted so bland.  It was also mushy - probably from sitting around a little too long ... and I couldn't even definitively taste the wasabi.  The portion was very small and yet it cost $3.85.  The mark-up and profit on this side dish must be huge.  So why mention this disappointing side when the obvious main attraction is the burger and that was excellent?  Well with all the burger joints that continue to head Philadelphia's way, it is going to be the little things that differentiate the various franchises....probably even more that the burgers themselves.  \n\nThe atmosphere with lots of woodwork kinda def fits in with the cuisine.

We went on  a Wednesday night. There was a line  45 minutes long. They do not take cell numbers or have a real system they just tell you to come back. \nWe kept going back. It was too cold to wait so long. We were in Nola  during a cold  spell and I got sick from the cold.\n When  we  finally got in  there were signs  all over saying you must buy one drink per person  per set! The seats  were  uncomfortable and the door was open  with the cold air coming in. If you look at pictures of their FB page it looks spacious but when we were there seats  were all cramped together.\nThe young lady taking names was rude, she was not even paying  attention to her list of names. She kept letting people in front of us in  spite of the fact that  we came back early several times. Several hours went by with the same pattern.\nWe finally made it in.  But things didn't get too much  better. \nIt is a bit chaotic in there.  I have to refer you to this review. This reviewer says it better than  I do. http://www.yelp.com/biz/three-muses-new-orleans#hrid:VsLBIA-cW-uA_PiPfgX0hg\nThe  restaurant was out of everything I wanted to eat.\nI had to leave it was too uncomfortable and we didn't get  to try  the  food  I know it is good other wise there would not be lines when other places are  empty but I did not have a good experience there! Plus they were out of everything I wanted and it was still early at  least for us New Yorkers it was early.\n We could not get a cab back to the hotel and had to walk in  the cold at  night! It was too stressful for me!\n I am  very disappointed in my experience there because I know it is good based on the  menu, the lines and ambiance.\n The lines were not filled with  tourists but locals.\n What I didn't know was there was  apparently  a big name there that night which is why  they  charged per set.  I did not know that. You can keep up with  them on  FB,  https://www.facebook.com/ThreeMuses\nHowever they had no special announcements on FB the night  we went so we were not prepared for the long  wait or cold open doors.  It  was a big waste of time for us and I wish they had a more efficient  way  of taking names and keeping up with how many people come so tables do not have to be squeezed together. I have to give it 3 stars for my experience since we wasted an entire night of our  very short vacation  which I got sick waiting  in  the cold. Nola had a cold spell when  we were there.\n Again I am very disappointed.  But how long we waited and the fact that  it was so cramped and the fact  that  they were out of everything  made it a disappointing experience for us. I need to add that  it was mid week not a weekend and not on  a tourist street.\nI am giving it 3 stars to be fair since I didn't get to try the  food.  I usually do not review places I have not eaten at like many Elites seem to do such  as trying to be first to review saying when it opens I hope to try it. That  is not me.\n That is those who are  Elite so they can keep their review count up. But since it ruined an entire night of our vacation I needed to review it  hoping they might change  their methods hoping it won't happen to others.\n The music had not started yet either. . If it is that crazy of a wait to get in  perhaps there should be a cover charge  and not charge  per set.  In that  case what happens is people wait around for the music and the tables are never cleared.  Especially when music has not started yet.  The people inside were obviously waiting for the music and did not plan on leaving. I am  sure it is a nice place but not run  efficiently to accommodate  the guests!

Dealing with an unexpectedly warm October evening, our initial plans of \"warming up with some yummy broth\" were not necessary, but we had a craving, and the only thing that could sate my buddy and I was ca-noodling at Cheu. We strolled in around 7:20 and the place was nowhere close to full. There were about 3 people at the bar and two sitting down, so we were immediately seated at the window. The inside of Cheu is warm and welcoming, the chalkboard showing off the daily specials (tea, beers, food, etc). A carafe of ice water was brought to our table, menus placed in front of us, and we were excited for a night out.\n\nCue when things took a turn for the questionable. I'm not sure if this is standard fare for Cheu, or just due to being a little bare bones, but we had two servers visiting our table periodically. I initially thought maybe one would just be to refresh our water, but they (a man and a woman) would follow after the other often less than a minute behind, asking the same questions. \n\n\"Have you decided on a drink?\" ..... \"Can I get you ladies some drinks?\"\n\nWait. Didn't I just tell that guy we weren't ready yet?\n\n\"Can I get that plate off the table for you yet?\" (Oh, no, we're still working on it, thanks.) .... \"Hey, want me to clear that plate for you, girls?\"\n\nNo, we haven't even taken another bite since that lady stopped by... what is happening?\n\nIf they looked even moderately similar, I'd have felt insane deja vu that would've suggested that I, too, was insane.\n\nAs far as food goes, we enjoyed the shaved kale with dates, pepitas, and cheese curds, coconut curry (for my vegetarian pal) and classic miso ramen with pork shoulder. The curry was spicy and delicious, heavy on the broth and the heat. The more classic-style ramen was definitely jonesing for a little kick, added with chili oil and sriracha. Our duo of servers were attentive, almost to a fault. Like... interrupting us to check in, desiring seemingly bite to bite updates. That being said, the bites were quite tasty. The pork shoulder was a little tough, but otherwise all quite good. We enjoyed our cans of beer and our food, which was swept away immediately the second we finished our food. Our male server came over to let us know that, despite receiving our check, \"No hurry though, take your time.\"\n\nFive minutes later, the moment after we placed our card down for the check, the female server came over and, despite our earlier server letting us know \"no hurry\" she  told us, in no uncertain terms, that \"because we have a waiting list, we need you to leave the table.\"\n\nEx-SQUEEZE ME? WHAT IS HAPPENING?!\n\nShocked by the sudden change in what we were supposed to do, we left, my friend just barely finishing the last of her drink.  I felt like this behavior totally ruined the experience for me, which was not going too poorly up to the point.

Still, our server anticipated this and had given the table a small dish of chili sauce to upgrade the burn.  I used some of it, but my guests did not.  They were content with what was presented, and not as accustomed to heavy spice as me (Good to know).  \n\nThe Gunpowder Chicken was also on the mildly sweet side, with a trace of chili on the bird breading, but with the sauce sweetened by an apple.  Unusual, and enjoyable, even if not packing heat.  \n\nThe Cumin Lamb was the strongest dish, with plenty of tender meat and cumin, that brought a light sweat to the upper lip.  Not the killer dose of cumin piled on lamb chops in some shops, but strong enough to know they were trying to appease us.  \n\nThe Crispy Beef with Toffee Cashews, was also tending toward sweetness, but they had candied the nuts very well, and when eaten with the copious slices of lightly crisped beef, was fun to eat.  \n\nFinally, the Jumbo Shrimp with Walnuts reinforced the theme that the house interpretation of spice and heat began from the perspective that food from this part of China was always degrees of sweetness or sourness, but not really chili pepper fire breathing dragons.  \n\nAgain, my friends were fine with all of this and genuinely enjoyed their meals.  It was my own blinders about Szechuan flames that was the issue, not the kitchen attempt to move their dial in my direction.  Once I realized that I was making myself too critical of the platters because I wanted my friends to be happy; and that they were already there and praising me for finding such a nice place to celebrate, that I was able to let go, and just roll with the food, and accept that it was really very good.  \n\nGood lesson to learn.  Better to let the house do what it does well, than to ask them to conform to my unrealistic expectations.", "date": "2016-04-23 22:05:54"}, {"_key": "72036", "_id": "reviews/72036", "_rev": "_fNyp87e--O", "review_id": "ls1yIi4LMpOTWUXEJCFAaw", "user_id": "4aC9eBCo3TAsP68H5CoywQ", "business_id": "O3JyUZS0wzsApHJ1h10Ndg", "stars": 5, "useful": 5, "funny": 3, "cool": 4, "text": "I can ride my bike with no handlebars...but it turns out an actual bar is way cooler than that.

It lived up to its reputation of serving fresh food. I give it three stars instead of four mainly because it's probably not on my top 10 places in Reno for Mexican food. Chipotle is not even my favorite Mexican-themed chain restaurant. That would be El Pollo Loco.\nFor my meal I got a burrito with beef, black beans, white rice, sour cream, cheese, lettuce and maybe some other stuff. I added a patrone margarita and a bag of chips with what they described as their hottest sauce.\nI had to wait about a month to try the place because the lines were so long the previous times I came. The staff was friendly when I placed my order. I got my burrito, chips and salsa when I paid and the maragarita came a few minutes later.\nChipotle failed to live up to the hype with my first bite of food. The chips are good quality chips. The salsa tastes mass produced. It was supposed to be their hottest salsa but it had a streak of that sweet ketchup flavor some shows up in salsas some times. My favorite salsas are the red salsa from the Michoacan region of Mexico with its nice garlic kick. \nThe ingredients in the burrito were fresh, but there were two significant flaws. No. 1 is that the rice overwhelmed everything else. Usually if one ingredient overwhelms a burrito it seems it is the beans, but not in this case. It made the burrito bland and a little dry. The second flaw was all the gristle I found on the beef. My tray had more than a half dozen chunks of inedible meat on it by the time I finished. I decided to spare Yelpers a photo of that.\nThe margarita was okay. I'd get one again but it was routine.\nThere's basically two kinds of wine bars: Those that serve wine that wine geeks like (these are the ones that have the hardest time surviving) and those that are a place where women feel safe to drink. I get the sense that Chipotle is a Mexican restaurant designed to make gringos feel safe to eat there.  Again, for a chain, they serve good quality food. I can get better food for less money at a half dozen taquerias around town. \nChipotle is a smoke jalapeno used in cooking. For people who have never had a good chipotle in a Mexican restaurant, I would suggest trying the camarones ala diabla (devil shrimp) at La Fuente in Sparks. It's quite a bit spicier than the hot salsa served at Chipotle but it has great depth of flavor.", "date": "2014-03-15 21:49:04"}, {"_key": "67798", "_id": "reviews/67798", "_rev": "_fNyp80C--E", "review_id": "UHCYCMvtqWeBVdwi8mP_zw", "user_id": "Dj77pkw_EZJvR-F4RIf_BQ", "business_id": "bKgyXSQUGA8IHGt8ne5NuA", "stars": 3, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "I remember the first time I tried Chipotle...I hated it.

That's about it. Because it's, like, a grocery store. With groceries.And sometimes wifi.\n\nWay back when I was stocking my cabinets with food instead of books, Dierbergs (and Trader Joe's) was a weekly run. I bought the hell out of couscous, cheese, sparkling grape juice and fruit leather. The cheese packaged in-store was phenomenal, plus I loved having an entire aisle dedicated to organic/natural/special diet items. Being able to pick up vitamins, sweet potato chips, dark chocolate, frozen Indian meals and toothpaste within 10 feet was perfect. The selection for these items was greater than at Schnucks, and the store always was cleaner. You'd pay $0.50-$1 more for things, but that was an acceptable trade-off. Also, huzzah for the store being at a Metrolink stop!\n\nDierbergs still has all of that, but I use the store completely differently now. These days, I go for lunch, snacks and wifi. I grab fresh fruit from the produce section, make a salad from the bar, pick up a $0.50 bottle of water and head to the cafe area to eat while writing. The store still works, but over the past few months, I've had some setbacks.\n\nSalad bar:\n- Not the best selection/variety of toppings. \n- Bar always is messy. \n-Labels are used only about half the time.\n- Not as vegetarian friendly as it first appears. Kidney beans are usually the only kind of vegetarian protein available, and those aren't put out all the time. Meaty toppings/pasta salads often are in back, so customers spill them into the vegetarian ones toward the front during the reach. Labels don't have vegetarian notation, and it's hard to see what's in some of the pastas. Hot soups aren't vegetarian, despite being broccoli or vegetable (usually made with meat-based stock/broth -- I asked).\n\nWifi cafe:\n- Convenient nook at the front of the store. Bright and pleasant, thanks to large windows.\n- Out of about 14 tables/booths, only one of them has an outlet, and it's not accessible unless you're sitting in that booth.\n- Wifi takes forever to be recognized and then to connect. Sometimes it doesn't happen at all.\n- If wifi is working, it's often very slow. It also bans you from most streaming media (No, I'm not trying to watch Netflix, but for my job I often need to listen to individual songs or watch videos embedded within blog posts). Despite this, Spotify works for some reason, though not well.\n- There are no utensils near the cafe area, so if you drop your fork, you have to go all the way back to the salad bar to get it - not awesome when you've already got your laptop and such strewn about. Why not stock some utensils at the cafe area with the coffee cups and napkins?\n\nGenerally, I like Dierbergs. If I actually kept food at my place, I'd likely buy some of it here. And having a store and wifi cafe in the inner ring is nice for a quick stop between clients. But even though Dierbergs is a little better than regular Schnucks stores, it could learn a LOT about salad bar arrangement and maintenance and wifi cafes from Schnucks' Culinaria model downtown.", "date": "2014-01-20 19:22:32"}, {"_key": "118637", "_id": "reviews/118637", "_rev": "_fNyp7dO--O", "review_id": "uwIowiMsBx5UnlMvdbUK5w", "user_id": "ml8VRTkq0CtEWKkDvOsEXQ", "business_id": "D4n4j_pBOhDJB6u1LRFaew", "stars": 3, "useful": 0, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "text": "Huge supermarket that is close to Metrolink.

I paid with my card,  which I immediately think might have been another potential headache on its own. They ran it,  reversed it,  and charged it again. We sat down and waited 15 minutes for a smoothie, which was OK. We did indeed wait 45 minutes for the wings, which were good. For medium,  they had a kick and were tasty.

If you're a dipper, and I am,  no or bad dip can be reason enough for me to give up on wings. Several customers were asking for their wings cooked hard because they were coming out a little underdone. They had no cocktail sauce for the seafood.

(I've even found some things to be cheaper than superfresh/fresh grocer/acme etc.). \n\nGoodbye, VGFOH qualms. \n\nPlus, they have rotating Monday through Friday specials that generally last 3 months or so (check the board by the prepared foods section).  Some of my favorites include: Buy 1, get 1 free soups, $2 off any made to order sandwich, and $2 off all deli meats.\n\nExtra perks are the exceptional service. There is always someone ready to help you.  The lady working at the bakery section actually tracked me down because she accidently charged me for a full loaf of bread instead a half.\n\nOnly complaint is that it smells funky over by the salad bar. I know, weird,  but true.  I have no idea what it is but it creeps me out.

I've never had a problem with any of the products I've purchased, except for the one time I thought I bought shredded cheese (it was the cheapest on the rack - $4, which is still ridiculous) only to go home and discover it's fake, imitation cheese, most likely made of soy.  I put it on my tacos and it tasted okay, but when I tried to make nacho cheese out of it by melting it in the microwave, it SOLIDIFIED into a hard, gooey ball of orange.  Cheese shouldn't do that.  Word to the wise: unlike me, read the labels carefully before you buy something Vegan when you don't want Vegan. \n\nThe store itself is way too crowded and the aisles leave you hardly any room to stop your cart and peruse the selections.

So Parada Maimon is a good compromise. Most of the times I've been here I've gotten the pernil with rice and black beans. I've tried the half chicken, the gizzards, and the mofongo. The chicken was good enough that I brought some home to my family. It was a hit. The price can't really be beaten. For those wondering, you can sub out rice and beans for some fries... or maybe some other side they're offering. \n\nWhat issues did I have? You can either order at the counter or you can have a seat. The counter (cafeteria style) food is ready-made while most other things are made to order. My first impression was underwhelming... as the pernil I had was dry. I didn't know to ask for gravy since I ordered from the menu. That wasn't enough to keep me away because I came back and had the mofongo and I didn't like it much. I mentioned in a review for another place that I don't fault the establishment. I just didn't know what I was getting into because it more or less tastes the same everywhere I've tried it. There was a little confusion in the portions... they should just say large and small, but instead they say lunch and dinner if I remember correctly.\n\nSo for the best dine-in experience... order at the counter, if you're not fluent in Spanish then English is fine...mostly (I got a verbal judo flip with my basic Spanish), state what sauces/gravy you want on your food and then have a seat. Also, get one of their fresh juices (Chinola for me). If you really want to EAT get the dinner (large) portion, but if you're there for the deal get the lunch (small). \n\nSo with a large plate of pernil with a good amount of gravy, some hot sauce and oil for the rice, and some thousand island or whatever for the little salad... I'm NICE! I think they have tres leches too, but I've been too full to try it.\n\nPRO-TIP: And ask for maduros... I don't think they're included, but I don't think they're extra. It's just like 3 or 4 and anyway.\n\nFUN FACT: The area is desolate so there's really no best way in or out on foot. You're catching alleys, bums, and long empty stretches on all sides.

Even cooked oysters need to have a blast of juice when you take a bite.  The shrimp, for the most part, were very well executed, crispy, flavorful and not over cooked.  The buffalo's were jumbo sized and had the right amount of buttery hot sauce heat and crunch, the firecracker were smaller but also crisped and expertly coated with sauce.  I didn't taste the coconut coated crustaceans, but the verdict was they tasted like they came out of a Sysco bag.  So a miss.  The frog legs were super plump, lightly coated and fried perfectly.  The meat was so tender and fresh, but it was missing seasoning.  A side of melted salted butter with garlic would have been the perfect accompaniment and the right fix for the lack of salt and flavor punch the legs needed.\n\nNext came another order of firecracker shrimp (they were one diner's Achilles heel), seared ahi tuna and a cup of the seafood bisque.  Tuna was deemed quite excellent, but the sweet drizzle was said to overwhelm the dish. More heat less sugar was the preference.

The time spent waiting was well worth every bite I ate. I think the only downside is the wait time. I don't know how long it takes to cook the pizzas. I'd assume awhile considering how thick the crusts are, but still, could they not have told us?\n\nAs far as the attitude of the bartender, I have to agree with Aimee K. The girl looked like she had a blank stare on her face, and she didn't seem too pleasant to talk to. I asked her when our salad was going to come out, and her reply was, \"when we get to it.\" I went back to my seat and continued to wait without questioning. I didn't want anything to happen to our beloved deep dish pizza!\n\nAnyway, aside from that, I like Black Thorn.

Chip's pork chop was a spectacle of gristle and fat.  Despite its huge size he probably got about a half portion due to the bad cut of meat.  His potatoes were pretty good. His asparagus were missing, but when he saw the sad little overcooked spears I received, he figured he'd pass.\n\nWhen Richard came back and asked if we wanted a box for the uneaten gristle and fat we told him it wasn't necessary and explained why.

Perhaps I have bad luck, but they are becoming skimpier and skimpier on their portions.  Tonight, my Dad's burrito bowl barely had any meat in it and when we asked for more, the girl gave a little snarl behind the counter and tossed about 2 more tiny chunks of meat into the bowl.  I generally order the vegetarian burrito bowl (not because I am a vegetarian, but for some reason this is the yummiest option to me).  It used to be that when I ordered a vegetarian, they piled on the beans, however tonight was another example of their cutting back on portions.  I asked for some more beans and again, the snarl and curt small plop of beans in my bowl.  \n\nWhen it came time for the cheese (one of my favorite parts) it was merely a sprinkle.  I remember the good old days when the cheese was piled high, in a beautiful mountain of cheesy deliciousness.  Not anymore though :(  however, I maybe should thank them for saving me the calories!\n\nFinally, I requested my guac on the side -- no problem there until I went to pay.  He tried to charge me for the guac... very un-dude.   I nicely inquired/informed that it was included with my vegetarian bowl.  He removed the charge, but he didn't look too happy about it.

However, lets face it, I'm a pig and every now and then, I can eat a normal human size amount of food.\n\nMy last time at Indian food was probably as a teenager, 20 or so years ago.  I don't remember it, except it was somewhere on Long Island.  Therefore, I didn't know what to order.  Thankfully, my girlfriend thought of posting a message on a yelp forum asking for advice for \"safe\" options for first time Indian food eaters, and Nick S and others (you know who you are) provided some great suggestions.  I went with one of their suggestions, the Chicken Tikka Masala.  Normally, I like spicy food.  However, with my preconceived notions, I decided to go with a medium heat (5 out of 10).  Glad I did, because even at a 5, I was sweating at the end (in fairness, I would be sweating eating a snow cone in Alaska in February).  Regardless, it was delicious - served in a creamy tomato sauce that I want to put on all of my food for now on.  \n\nWe also had a plate of nan bread with some dipping sauces that was also very enjoyable.  The sauces had an interesting flavor - couldn't quite place all of the spices - but very good.\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is very ethnic - decorated pretty much like you would expect an Indian restaurant to be decorated.  Very cute.  The service was fantastic.  Waitstaff couldn't have been friendlier, and our server couldn't have been more helpful with the menu.\n\nThey have a lunch buffet 7 days a week where they serve almost their whole menu (according to our server), so that our next trip will probably be for that so we can sample other dishes and see what we like.  Until then, the aforementioned Nick told us about an Indian market in Tampa, and I am going to try to make me some Chicken Tikka Masala...I might add bacon.", "date": "2014-09-11 21:08:28"}, {"_key": "117454", "_id": "reviews/117454", "_rev": "_fNyp7bu--U", "review_id": "9JpxZpcDPTGqIEBoz0IUBg", "user_id": "WuiEYopWZOWOuWQD87fVSw", "business_id": "YtSqYv1Q_pOltsVPSx54SA", "stars": 4, "useful": 2, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "text": "The general consensus about this place: Juicy, well seasoned prime rib, but with an overly pretentious atmosphere and mediocre service. \n\nWe had a reservation for 7:00, but wasn't seated until 7:30.

And if you have your heart set on seeing and touching a baby alligator like they show on their website, you may also be disappointed as there are not enough for all the boats to have one.  Some people on our tour (from Australia, no less) had their hearts set on it and the tour guide acted like he didn't know what they were talking about!\n\nThe tour itself, was fun.  A couple of hours in the sunshine on a boat?  What could be wrong with that?  And we did see a few turtles, an egret and 3 snakes (not the highlight of my trip, I must add)  And it was too early in the season for mosquitoes too so that was a win!\n\nBut it was so busy back on the bayou that we had to keep backing up to let other boats pass and the quantity of marshmallows that were floating in the water made me wonder why they were pitching marshmallows at the alligators- last I checked meat would have been a better idea but maybe the economy hit the alligator feeding too!\n\nThe $49 tour ($43 if you book it on line) will get you picked up at your hotel in their bus and admission to the boat tour.  If you have your own car- it's only $25.  If I had to do it again- I'd probably rent a car just so I didn't have to hear the crazy tour that the bus driver gave us on the 45 minute drive to the swamps.\n\nHe kept talking and offering up things like \"Katrina . . . . .as seen on CNN, and the weather channel, this is the bridge that people were walking on . . .as seen on CNN\"  or having us note the large amount of closed car dealerships that were closed around the route (I can show him a similar amount of closed dealerships in most states that didn't have a Hurricane).  But the real irritant was as we were driving along the interstate- he would suddenly swerve over to the side of the road and stop to show us some water where he would say, \"See . . . .no one is reck-creating today as there are gators in those waters\"  Urrgh.  After 45 minutes of this I had a headache!  And I kept thinking we were going to be rear ended on the freeway!!\n\nAnd know that you go back on the bus that you came on so remember the number. So we got to spend more time with this guy.   If the \"reck-creating\" wasn't enough- on the way back we went by a space shuttle from the very well known launch pad in \"Cape COD\".  Really?  I didn't know that Provincetown was launching rockets these days!\n\nFriendly, for sure, but I personally preferred the statically radio playing disco songs to the constant chatter of this guy.\n\nGo for the boat ride- it's worth it and a great way to spend a sunny afternoon.

Tour groups are always kind of a crap shoot, I guess, and Cajun Encounters is no exception. \n\nI enjoyed the Swamp Tour a lot. Our guide had the perfect mix of wry humor, interesting facts and amusing stories. Furthermore, he was clearly passionate about what he did and loved his city, so he didn't sound like he was reciting a rehearsed script. The tour itself takes you through some beautiful passages within Honey Island Swamp. Those silver, hanging Spanish moss curtains you see in pictures? They're real. In person, they are so utterly beautiful that I would actually recommend you tour the swamps in the winter than in warmer seasons. You may not see as much wildlife (although we still managed to see (and handle) a baby alligator, 2 snakes, 4 turtles, 1 magnificent blue heron, a beaver-like creature, and a mama wild boar with her 2 piglets who swam out to our boat for 20 mins feasting on the marshmallows our guide threw), but there is no foliage to mar the beauty of all that silver.\n\nThe Plantation Tour was much less impressive. Not so much for the plantations or the guides, but rather that it was very poorly planned. We were given far too much time at Laura Plantation (about 3 hours) and far too little time at Oak Alley (about 1 hour total from disembarking to re-boarding). Personally, I was completely unimpressed with our guide at Laura (who for some reason pronounces \"archives\" with a hard \"ch\" like the herb), and do not understand why people rave about the tour here. I was ready to leave halfway through. Oak Alley on the other hand is just as majestic and beautiful in person as it is in all the postcards, and the tour guides are far more captivating.

Make sure you can spare about 5 hours in total for the tour. The swamp they took us to was Honey Island, about 45 minutes away from the French Quarter area. The shuttle stops at about 3-4 other hotels and the tour itself is a little less than 2 hours, but there is still other time to factor in, including tour check-in and then waiting around again for the drop-off shuttle. \n\nWe made a reservation for a Saturday morning pick-up, but the weather was not too favorable. They called about 45 minutes beforehand to cancel and/or push the tour for a later time, keeping in mind the anticipated weather for the rest of the day. Glad they did that because I've booked other tours that just pick up patrons and make people wait in hopes that the rain clears out. \n\nThere are things to know about swamp tours which they tell you while you're on the boat. I wish there was a little check list beforehand. Like, we wouldn't see and big alligators in April because they're all out mating. Only smaller gators too young to mate would be in the swamp (so they were a little harder to see). And in advance, be prepared or ask around about mosquito activity. \n\nThe boat fits in about 20 people. Try to be one of the first on the boat so that you're not hit by the water when the boat accelerates. And you're also closer to the tour guide when he feeds and attracts the gators. Our guide was Captain Mark. At times the boat ride was a little bumpy from bigger wooden logs just floating around. He did a great job navigating and telling the history of pre/post Katrina and plant biology. He's also well-trained to spot the gators, which I thought is difficult considering they were only about 3-4 feet long. \n\nAt the end of the tour, we saw 4 little gators, 2 water snakes, a few duck eggs, and over 8 wild hogs. Didn't see any exotic birds, turtles or bears. Overall, I was quite satisfied with this excursion and the service of the driver, staff and Capt.

Know that when you call them, you'll get to speak to a live person without having to jump through any hoops. That was my experience at least, and since I was putting a lot of money onto my credit card, I appreciated the awesome customer service that answered all my questions up front. \n\nValue: \nThe plantation/swamp combo tour is $120/person and well worth every penny. Depending on the length of your stay in New Orleans, I would suggest buying the combo tour and splitting it over the course of two days, which they allow you to do (ex: plantations one day, swamp the next). We did both tours back to back the same day, and while it was fun, it was a LONG day (8:30am - 8:00pm). \n\nShuttle:\nOur shuttle guide going out to the plantations was great - she pointed out the local attractions and sights, including some damage from Hurricane Katrina, but also kept it light and fun with a few personal anecdotes. Liked her. The other shuttle driver on the way back from the swamp, however, was terrible. He went around the block several times attempting to drop a party off, and we had to run up to the front while the shuttle was in motion because he failed to call out our hotel as a stop on his route. It's listed on your paper, silly!\n\nPlantations: \nIt's not fair to review Cajun Encounters for the quality of your plantation tours (review those tour guides/businesses separately!). But our experience was so wonderful I might as well share it here. Laura & Oak Alley plantations speak for themselves. The plantations are rich with history, beauty and Southern tradition. You'll feel like you're on the set of Gone With the Wind. A few other highlights: lemon mint julep (Oak Alley) and some beautiful photo opportunities. At Oak Alley, the guides dress up in hoop skirts and you really feel like you've stepped back in time. At Laura, we had an amazing tour guide who gave us some detailed and interesting facts, including the slave codes and treatments in Louisiana vs. \"the other side of the river\". Very interesting. Again, the quality of your plantation tour all depends on your tour guide! :)\n\nSwamp: \nMany of us thought that this was the highlight of our entire New Orleans trip. Captain Bishop was our guide and he was the only one with the \"magic voice\" that lured Big Al to eat his marshmallow/weenie on a stick! The other captains tried but to no avail - it must have been the baby talk that worked! Yes, you will be reminded of Disney's Jungle Cruise, especially with the comedy schtick - but I for one appreciated the jokes, especially the \"Cajun humor\" that Bishop inserted. We went at the perfect time just around sunset, so it was cool and refreshing with the Spanish moss blowing in the breeze. The swamp was actually quite beautiful in its own way. We saw gators of all ages and sizes UP CLOSE (the juveniles were much more eager to eat the marshmallows and weenies). We also saw birds and different types of foliage, etc. It's really great. To keep it from getting too slow, you'll go fast in the boat a couple times - which was a lot of fun!! My favorite part of the swamp was drifting by the little shanty homes on the bayou, where scenes from Beasts of the Southern Wild were filmed. Folks were sitting on their porches, drinking beers and waving to us - it was kind of awesome. After all living on the swamp, to them, is just daily life.

This is a fine dining institution in Santa Barbara and it's French with a star LA chef and the owners spared no expense in the remodeling of the casual, not divey but not nice, State and A which managed to stay in business a couple decades in spite of the subpar food. \n\nIt turns out the owners have grown daughters in NYC and I have so enjoyed my afternoon here. My iPhone 5 makes a hotspot so I'm blogging before I meet a friend at 4 and swim to work off the potato daphinois--don't ask about the fat content--a sinful tower of thinly sliced potatoes with cheese and oil and all manner of terrible things which taste wonderful. \n\nMy scramble--a bargain at 12.95--included perfect carmelized onions, roasted peppers, spinach and a hint of goat cheese--and I will dream of this till my next brunch here after Chicago/Michigan trip. \n\nAfter 5 cups of coffee to wake me up from horrible asthmatic night, I had a glass of the Ballard Pinot for dessert Nice but no better than the cheaper--9/glass--Kenwood Cab which I think is quite a respectable Cab for the money. \n\nThe coffee is good but if you're like my father who, due to his time in the military, requires coffee which scalds the tongue, you will need to pull a Dad and ask them to nuke it in the \"radar oven.\" It's not hot but I don't really care as it tasted good and did the trick: that is, it enabled me to have two glasses of wine after a miserable night of wheezing, hacking and blowing my nose. \n\nI cannot say enough for Maggie's and am so happy it's here in SB. I will come before my next show at the Granada for dinner at the bar. I have a subscription (see Yelp) and come alone.\n\nPS I haven't eaten here at dinner yet but every single person who brought me food or booze was fabulous and I got to chat at length with the spectacular, smart owner with whom it turns out I have quite a bit culturally in common.

Usually I've been there for 10 course meals which are always way more food than I need to be eating but it's a sometimes treat that is worth having. So there's that! :) \nI don't avoid this place. I don't seek it out. I think the food is generally really delicious, but I know that the service is middling. I've had better. I've had worse. And usually when I finish a meal here, I'm pretty darn full and happy. But I guess a lot of that is the fact that I'm usually here with a group for a 10 course meal.

Yes, we did have reservations and no we did not need to wait for a table. We arrived right on time and were immediately seated. Zeppoli's is great because it is also a BYOB, so we sat down and were given wine glasses immediately. The menu is small and precise. Our server was wonderful and before ordering we were told that this is traditional Cicillian cuisine and not standard Italian fare. \n\nWe started out with the following apps: Panzanella Catania, Insalada Verde, and the Antipasto Siciliano. We were also given an order of Finocchi Salsiccia, Fennel Sausage, because they forgot to provide me with silverware. Both salads were good, citrusy and fresh. The anchovies that were on the Panzanella salad were ridiculously good and added a lightly salted note to the tomato and bread. The sausage was also delicious, it basically melted in your mouth and the rabe that was provided with the sausage gave it a great bitter element. But the star here was Antipasto. Good lord was that a good salad. I wish I could eat that dish every night. It was so wonderful. It has sharp provolone, marinated mushrooms, beans, salami, roasted red peppers and tomatoes and the list of awesomeness kept going. Probably the best Antipasto dish I have ever eaten.\n\nFor our Entr\u00e9es the ladies each ordered the Taglietteli al Limone with prosciutto and I ordered the Taglietteli al Limone with bottarga as a small order and my buddy had the Pesto Trapanese. The Taglietteli was wonderful. It was like a flavor explosion in my mouth. Super citrusy and fresh and then you add in the bottarga and the dish just blew my mind because it went, citrusy, clean, fresh and oceany (Not sure if that is a word, but that is what it tasted like). Awesome dish! The pesto dish was ridiculous as well. My friend did let me try a bite; he was reluctant to do so. We also both had the Fisherman's Stew. It was good; the standout on this dish was the calamari. I guess that is how calamari is supposed to be cooked. It wasn't even close to rubbery, it was tender and basically melted in your mouth.\n\nWe did have room for desert and got the Zeppoli. They were wonderful, especially after you dipped them in the nutella. They came out fresh and hot. I definitely burned my mouth because I didn't want to wait to eat it.\n\nOverall this was one of my favorite meals in 2012. I would come back to Zeppoli's every week if I could afford it, alas I cannot. However, next time we are looking for somewhere good to go near Cherry Hill, Zeppoli's will certainly be in the forefront of my mind.", "date": "2013-01-02 17:47:31"}, {"_key": "68629", "_id": "reviews/68629", "_rev": "_fNyp81a--T", "review_id": "_V9YU7_TiBZIAOeQKHW7eQ", "user_id": "zUk_Ww2q1At1QSyRbUjIGQ", "business_id": "B6Lvq3sOYwhKxPzadDka9g", "stars": 5, "useful": 3, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "text": "Absolutely beyond the 'woohoo! as good as it gets!' 5 Yelp stars!  \n\nZeppoli blew me away with every course from start to finish!

Everyone was very friendly, knowledgeable and cheerful. The rolls they bake fresh are very delicious (although I didn't particularly care for the cinnamon flavored butter). They also have roasted peanuts at every table (and also two very large barrel-fulls of the roasted peanuts at the entrance/waiting area). My parents really loved the peanuts and couldn't stop eating them.\n\nThe price was really quite reasonable since most of the dishes come with two sides. We ordered a full rack of ribs and side orders of mashed potatoes and steak fries.  The ribs were literally falling-off-the-bone  delicious. The flavor and texture of the meat and BBQ sauce was among the best I've had in a while. The quantity of the mashed potatoes was a bit disappointing since the size was the equivalent of a large spoonful in a small dish. Also, the steak fries were only average, although they were well seasoned. It would have been much better if it little was a little more crispy on the outside. \n\nWe also ordered the grilled salmon with a side of Caesar salad and a sweet potato. The salad was very fresh and well flavored. The croutons were super yummy, although it didn't feel like they gave us enough (either that or they were just that good). The sweet potato was also very well steamed and flavorful. The only complaint is that the salmon smelled... well... fishy (not in a good way). The taste was also a little off... and definitely did not mix well with the ribs. We ended up eating only a few bits of the salmon, and thought we'd let the manager know about the potential problem with the freshness of the fish.\n\nWe asked the server if we could speak to the manager (and she immediately went to get him for us). We explained the problem and the manager immediately offered to get us another dish or to take the grilled salmon off our bill.

It should also be notated that I only live 2 blocks away. I was not going to peel myself off the couch today!\n\nI was stoked to find out that they were able to accommodate my vegan requests by serving up spaghetti with marinara sauce, \"dry\" breadsticks, and a salad sans cheese. The food was filling and hit the spot and was delivered in under 45 minutes. I am curious to try the vegetarian sandwich but am bummed that pizza doesn't appear to be in my near future.\n\nService was friendly, fast, and the daily specials offered on the website are enticing.Their prices are quite reasonable! I was leaning towards 4 stars but would like to try a few other items on the menu before I can commit to that. Hopefully, some vegan cheese will be on their menu soon?
