My friend and I were seated pretty quickly with no reservations. We arrived at the restaurant around 5:30pm, on a Friday.\n\nThey have a pretty wide selection of sushi to choose from. I love how the menu includes pictures so you have an idea of what the food looks like. \n\nMy friend and I ordered : Sushi pizza (salmon), sushi sandwich (salmon), sushi cake (salmon), prawn tempura (6 pieces) and tempura ice cream (mango). We are major raw salmon sashimi fans and this was definitely reflected in our selections.\n\nThe prawn tempura came out first. The tempura was crispy and temperature was nice and hot. \n\nNext came the sushi sandwich - definitely shareable. There were 6 giant triangle pieces - altogether almost the size of 3 normal sandwiches. My friend opted to not have the Oranj sauce (not too spicy mayo) on this. It still tasted okay but was drier minus the sauce and thus a tad harder to eat. I dunked it in soy sauce to compensate. It had rice and nori (for the bread) and salmon, avocado and purple onion inside. \n\nThe sushi cake arrived next. It came in 8 rectangular shaped sushi pieces. Also very shareable. Easy to eat because of the Oranj sauce was drenched on top. This too had salmon and avocado layered between. I really liked this!\n\nThe sushi pizza had a 1/2 inch thick rice patty that  was kinda breaded and fried. The \"pizza\" was topped with avocado, fresh tomatoes and salmon. The taste was just okay. This was supposed to come with Oranj sauce but my friend opted to not have this. Personally, I think the sauce makes a difference in terms of making things taste better and easier to swallow. \n\nFinally, the tempura on the tempura ice cream kinda fell off the mango ice cream but I still found it pretty tasty! The tempura part kind of tasted like yellow cake. An cute touch was the 2 strawberry Pocky sticks (Asian crackers shaped like sticks and dipped in different flavors).\n\nAn interesting and slightly weird thing about this place is the washroom. You walk out through the back of the restaurant and partially into another restaurant! The washroom is technically in another restaurant!\n\nOverall, I'd consider coming back here to try the other items on the menu. The prices are a bit expensive but the portions are pretty generous. Our bill ended up coming to $71.40 and we didn't even order any drinks - just water. It's not the best sushi in the world but it's also not the worst either. \n\nThe service was okay. The waitresses were somewhat attentive but at times difficult to get in contact with. It's not a very big restaurant. There were 2 waitresses and 1 hostess.\n\nIf I'm in the mall, I MIGHT give it a try if I'm in the mood for some quick Japanese food. But I wouldn't come in here with super high expectations.", "date": "2015-09-26 00:57:59"}, {"_key": "100023", "_id": "reviews/100023", "_rev": "_fNyp7Cy--V", "review_id": "6Og4xRxKYtMf1ZDegHaWaw", "user_id": "7ONBs-KW1TlLBfaabxdk_g", "business_id": "V3BE5TB1LOWbne3r-fWLsg", "stars": 4, "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "This food truck was in front of USF Health today and I decided to give them a try. I ordered the Miso Love Love with Chicken. The Miso Love Love is a creamy miso coconut sauce that is on top of your choice of chicken, pulled pork or pork belly. It was served over rice and had a side of asian greens. The asian greens looked to be chinese broccoli and was topped with a sesame paste-like sauce and sesame seeds. Surprisingly, this was my favorite part. I wish it came with more. The chicken was very flavorful also and the portion size was good. Total was $8 for the meal. There were a lot of great options and I feel like I played it safe today. I want to try the other, spicy sauces next time. \n\nI usually stay away from asian fusion food trucks because the food is usually not as authentic and portions are small.

We drank it, obviously, but switched to beer immediately thereafter. Good selection of beers on draft and bottle as well.\n\nWe went ahead and ordered the tuna. It was seared and sliced ever so delicately. It was paired with toasted baguette slices and a nice horseradish aioli. I dominated that tapa and didn't let my lover even look at it. It was phenom.\n\nWe also ordered the scallop gratin; for the price tag, I was rather displeased. Minimal amount of scallop- too much potato.\n\nWe had some sort of trout dip dish.

If I were to revisit( a good chance I will) I'd probably opt for bar area, especially during happy hour since those specials are not offered in dining room. Trish made the reservation for our group and ran into one glitch, the day of the event our 5:30 was changed to 5:00 by the restaurant. This was supposedly to accommodate another party at 7. We were not rushed out when that time approached but we also saw no sign of another party. \n\nI first perused the beer offerings, there seemed to be at least 10 on draught and some earlier offerings in cans. I selected their blueberry Hefeweizen and enjoyed the crisp flavor on this warm night, even though little to no berry taste came through. I would probably try something else next time. The food menu was possibly too large( in my opinion) with sandwich, pizza, apps and entrees offered. I was very hungry and 75% of the menu appealed to me, so I went to our excellent server Frank for his advice. He suggested a few dishes and I thought my beer choice would pair nicely with the pan roasted chicken entree. It proved to be good advice, a nicely cooked Frenched breast with the skin crispified served with what seemed to be local asparagus and mashed potatoes. The fowl was tender and juicy still, the pan sauce was lightly citrusy and herbed, it was good but could have been better if reduced and thickened. The mashed were ok, and probably the weakest link in the dish. I had an add on Caesar salad that was fair and overpriced( as add ons go) at $6. Trish went with his advice and ordered a shrimp and scallops special, she loved it and I have to admit, they are sourcing quality crustaceans.\n\nMost others in our group ordered burgers and we heard many good things.

I used to go to this when I was younger and didn't appreciate BBQ as much.  Now that I live in Vegas and used to go to school in Texas, I'm always on the search for some damn good BBQ ribs.   \nThis year there were 24 BBQ companies.  Wow meat everywhere.  I hit up only a few, but I made sure that the ribs were drenched in sauce....Checkered Pig BBQ (dry and sauce needed some heat), Aussom Aussie Australian BBQ Co  (a bit dry, and just needed more tang and spice in such a sweet sauce), Desperado's BBQ Rib Co (lots of heat and tang, it also offered pickle chips to snack on---i wanted this place to win), and Porky N Beans (a meat dish over rice with too much sauce, so it was very sweet and tangy).   I also washed these down with ice-cold lemonade, and this great tasting Jalapeno Brew from the Great Basin Brewing Co. (you smell nachos, after every sip....it also has heat...i'll be back for this brew)  Finally, I had to get my vegatables, so I bought grilled white corn on the cob drenched with lemon juice and powdered w/pepper and garlic.\nIf you ever make it to the cook-off, I have a few recommendations to make the experience better:  1. Go with a bunch of people b/c there are not too many places to sit down and eat.  2. Leave someone behind while each person goes to each booth to buy a bunch of ribs and drinks to bring it back for a huge feast.  3.  Time..if you're early smaller lines, but hotter in the day..if it's later in the evening, longer lines, but cooler.  4.  Spend a long time there, to digest everything and try everything.    5.  Bring plenty of cash, some places take credit, but it's better to have cash.  6.  If you have money, buy a private table for $800 (share w/a bunch of friends b/c its all you eat and drink).    \nSo if you're craving ribs and you're in Sparks,NV during Labor Day next year, I'll definitely see you there!!!", "date": "2006-09-12 01:38:58"}, {"_key": "100710", "_id": "reviews/100710", "_rev": "_fNyp7Di--W", "review_id": "NbpjeY3zt0lvXvmdyUNAtg", "user_id": "UEIOT1JdvCDIXLN8dQIiGg", "business_id": "vFJIK-z3QWs-3XNjs1hcZQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 22, "funny": 7, "cool": 14, "text": "New Orleans Jazz Market is definitely the place you want to visit on a relaxing Saturday Night.

Not only was the content great, but Jeffrey was a great storyteller and if you had any questions, he had answers. I could tell immediately that he enjoyed his job and actually cared about being a good storyteller, unlinke some other tour guides that I've had who were just going through the motions.\n\nFast forward a year and a half, and then-boyfriend is now my husband, and we were back in New Orleans for our honeymoon! I decided to book us on their bike tour, the cemetary tour, and the ghost tour. All of them were fantastic. And this time, we met Jeffrey's wife, and she gave us the cemetary tour. She's just as good of a storyteller as Jeffrey, and we got to watch her yell at someone who was writing \"XXX\" on Marie Leavau's tomb. (You shouldn't do it, it's disrespectful. And a felony.)\n\nThe bike tour was lots of fun, and we got to see areas of the city close to the French Quarter but a bit beyond walking distance. The ghost tour was interesting, and the only tour of the three this time that had other people on it. Being the night before Halloween, there were more people on the tour than normal - but it was still only a group of 10 people! We were walking by groups of 30ish people, and I can't imagine trying to deal with that many people while trying to jockey for good position to hear the story. Blah!

That, plus a short bar, plus a corner kitchen area, constitutes the entire restaurant.\n\nIt's quite dark inside, with tabletop candles and Spanish music playing in the background - perfect for a first date, a hundredth date, or drinks with close friends and co-workers. Not, on the other hand, a family-friendly restaurant; I wouldn't recommend bringing any children here.\n\nThe wine list was quite extensive, as I expected it to be, and offered a variety of by-the-glass choices, and just as many by-the-bottle options. I tasted two red wines during my visit: the Ben Marco Malbec, Argentina (hints of blackcurrant and slightly acidic) and the Pasion Brava Tempranillo (Rioja), Spain (much sweeter, very smooth drinking). No matter your wine preference, Tzin has a variety of options to suit every taste, and the excellent service ensures that your wine glass is always topped up.\n\nTzin offers a typical tapas-style menu: a selection of small-ish dishes with a strong foundation in Spanish cuisine. Diners can either select several to share amongst their party, or choose one or two for themselves. Everything (and I mean everything) sounded delicious, so it was difficult to make a decision.\n\nIn the end, I decided to try the Olive Plate to start, since I love pairing marinated olives with wine. Alongside the olives, the plate boasted a selection of focaccia bread, olive tapenade, and a dish of olive oil and balsamic vinegar, all of which were delectable. The warm marinated olives were delicious and went extremely well with my glass of Ben Marco.\n\nFor dinner, we decided to order separate dishes, and opted for the Chorizo and Gnocchi Stew and the Chicken Breast Supreme. The stew, served with grilled flat bread, was absolutely heavenly and had a weighty tomato taste that complemented the manchego gnocchi and chorizo exceptionally well. The chicken breast dish was moist and tender, and was served on a bed of harissa couscous and dried apricots, with a dollop of minted yoghurt. Harissa is a Tunisian hot chili sauce, so the couscous understandably had a bit of a kick to it; if you don't like spicy foods, I'd advise you not to choose this dish. The spiciness isn't overpowering, but it'll set your mouth tingling if you eat enough of the couscous.\n\nWe had excellent service throughout our entire visit - the server was very friendly and accommodating - and enjoyed the chic d\u00e9cor, open-style kitchen, and gigantic wine rack (my next purchase).\n\nOne of the things I like best about Tzin is that they're all about the dining experience. This restaurant is about relaxing, enjoying a good glass of wine, and sampling delicious appetizers and tapas plates. They're a hole-in-the-wall restaurant simply for this reason; if they were to enlarge the space and cram in as many tables as possible, they'd lose much of the charm they get from the currently intimate, personal dining experience. \n\nIf you work downtown, if you enjoy wine and tapas, or, hell...if you live in Edmonton...you need to make a date to visit Tzin sometime soon. As I've said, and as their website stresses, they're a small restaurant, so please make the most of OpenTable and book yourself a place. Then all you need to do is sit back, quaff some wine, nibble on an appetizer, and simply experience.", "date": "2013-10-11 20:52:28"}, {"_key": "100953", "_id": "reviews/100953", "_rev": "_fNyp7Dy--R", "review_id": "9zFPVil4D1zByPPWRDSe2g", "user_id": "nr35WjC-YI0dFcsnW33Szw", "business_id": "VZFQS0SXzXPuxISbAgIVBA", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "So I love local coffee shops.

I heard the owner telling someone that his wife makes all the food and she only makes one dish at a time...which doesn't seem like the best idea.

I ordered longaniza and carnitas, which were served up promptly.  The longaniza was delicious, and matched up well with the excellent salsa verde.  The carnitas was a disappointment.  As I found at another taqueria in the area, unlike the pulled pork which often makes up carnitas, this taco was completely filled with parts of a pig I didn't recognize.  I'm usually an adventurous eater, but this looked so bad I didn't touch it and threw it away.  Looking back, I should have brought it up with the friendly owner, Roberto, but our conversation moved to other topics.  I'll definitely ask him next time about it, as it's possible I was served up something like tripe in error.\n\nI thought I'd add some additional info on Chazumba as a followup.  The interior is very simple, minimal decor and about ~20 seats.  Their menu has10 kinds of tacos (steak, chicken, pastor (marinated pork), suadero (brisket), lengua (tounge), carnitas (pork), longaniza (spicy sausage), cabeza (cow head), tripe, and Barbados (lamb only available on weekends).  I didn't see shrimp offered this time, so I'll need to ask if it's still available.\n\nIn addition they have burritos, huaracha, quesadilla, sopes, alambre (meats and cheese), and 10 kinds of tortas ($7-10).  Also available is 3 roast chicken dishes, 3 homemade soups, and 6 desserts (including flan and strawberries & cream).  Rounding out the menu is fruit jello, apple salad and pastes (a small pastry stuffed with a variety of fillings).\n\nTo wash all of that down, make sure to try the aguas frescas, an uncarbonated \"fruit water\" prepared every day.  Unlike a typical Kool-Aid or punch, these are not overly sweet at all, just full of great, mild fruit flavor, served out of a huge jug filled with ice.  The flavor of the day was peach/mango, and it was delicious.\n\nAnd if you have a chance, introduce yourself to Roberto and his lovely wife Rosemary, who work from 9am-midnight 7 days each week to deliver their authentic tastes.

This is one of my favorite appetizers. The garlic adds a nice flavor to this dish.\n\nWontons in Chili Oil (3.5/5) - I really like the actual wonton itself, but these soak up a little too much chili oil for me\n\nDan Dan Noodle (4.5/5) - This dish is a staple of Han Dynasty. I love it so much that after I moved away from Philadelphia, I learned how to make it myself. The only reason I'm giving it a 4.5 instead of a 5 is that sometimes, it comes out kind of watery. A must have if you come to Han Dynasty.\n\nCold Sesame Noodle (3.5/5) - These noodles are a nice substitute for the Dan Dan noodles if you don't have a high heat tolerance. They are also a nice side dish to have so not EVERYTHING you eat is spicy. It is a little too sesame-y for me though.\n\nBraised Beef Noodle Soup (4/5) - One of my favorite noodle dishes. The broth is nice and warm, and they are generous with the meat. This is also a nice, non-spicy dish to enjoy.\n\nSpicy Beef Noodle Soup (3/5) - This is a spicy version of the dish before. For some reason, there is something about the chili oil which I don't enjoy much. I don't like the way it coats my tongue when I am drinking the soup.\n\nDry Pepper Chicken/Fish (4/5) - I usually get this dish when I come here too. The level of fried is nice, and it is a pleasant level of heat. \n\nCumin Lamb (3.5/5) - Usually I enjoy cumin in my food, but this is a little too cumin-y for me. My other friends seem to really enjoy this dish though. Regardless, it is a pretty tasty dish, just a strong for my taste.\n\nCrispy Rice Chicken/Fish (4/5) - This dish is a favorite of my friends who can't handle spicy food.

Unfortunately I don't think I got a pick a of the prices, but basically you get about an 8-10 inch pizza with all the toppings of your choice, for about $9. The kids pizzas come with drinks and are about $5 give or take. The time to actually cook your pizza is magical as well. Yes, I know I said magical lol. Basically as you are paying your pizza will probably be completed. I have no idea how they do it but they do and it's really heaven. \n\nSo my daughter had the standard cheese pizza which was good. Pepperoni was too. I had the meats option which was tasty as well. We also tried this pizza with chicken, white sauce, mozzarella, artichokes, pesto, and garlic (oh btw, get the garlic. Get lots of it. Trust me on this). This pizza was so out of the norm for my normal pizza but it was so good! \n\nHonestly, to me the only thing that could've been better was the customer service. There was one particular guy, I think he may have been a manager, that was just going way too fast. Like, I get that it's a fast place, but don't be so rushed while I give you my ingredients that you end up putting something on my pizza that I didn't want. Also, he seemed to have an attitude while speaking with customers.

The cruise costs $28.50, and for $11 more you can get lunch, which I did.\n\nAbout five minutes before boarding an old lady on the top deck started belting out a deafening version of \"Pennies from Heaven\" on the calliope, which I think was intended to let the passengers know we were about to leave. There must have been a couple of hundred other people taking the tour, so I assumed it had to be reasonably good. \n\nI was wondering why they allowed 30 minutes for boarding, and found out as I got close to the front of the line. There were a few of crew near the gangway taking the obligatory cheesy tourist photo. Honestly, will I fall for this again? Probably...\n\nThey pointed the passengers who'd paid for lunch straight into the dining room, which takes up most of the first deck. They give you a little laminated card that says \"Occupied\" which you put on your table while you browse the buffet. I was greeted by a very friendly lady called Gina as soon as I entered. She settled me in, got me an iced tea, and replaced my bread pudding dessert as she said the first bit was a little bit burnt. How lovely!\n\nThe buffet included beans and rice, sausages, some salads, fried catfish and corn bread. Iced tea and iced water is also included in the price, but if you want anything else from the full bar that runs along one wall of the restaurant, you have to pay extra. The catfish was actually really good, and I liked the corn bread too, but the bread pudding was deserving of seconds. Tasted like the steamed pudding I used to have when I was a kid.\n\nThere was a good jazz band called The Steamboat Stompers playing at one end of the room when I entered. They politely stopped when the captain started his commentary. The Natchez is actually the sixth or seventh reincarnation of the original 19th century vessel and is only 40 years old, however the engines came from the tow boat Clairton and date from 1910. It's one of only two steamboats still operating in the US.\n\nGina took my photograph next to the window above the paddle wheel with the New Orleans skyline reflected in the glass, then I went up to the top deck where they have a gift shop. \n\nWe sailed seven miles up the Mississippi passed the site of the Battle of New Orleans where the Americans defeated the British in 1815, thus ending the War of 1812. I could see the white obelisk of the monument commemorating the battle over the top of the levee.\n\nBought a drink from the Texas Bar on the upper deck and sipped it at a table by the railing under the canopy. The jazz band had started playing again and a cool breeze was coming down the river. Very pleasant. Finished my drink and relocated to the rear upper deck, which also has a small bar. Ordered a Bacardi and coke and watched the river roll by. I can think if a lot worse ways to spend a couple of hours than drifting down the Mississippi in an old paddle steamer. Good tour, and certainly enhanced by gina's excellent customer service.\n\nSent from my iPad", "date": "2014-10-03 19:15:16"}, {"_key": "101391", "_id": "reviews/101391", "_rev": "_fNyp7Ey--i", "review_id": "al5NAgYm7JVL_7ZrXBtj_w", "user_id": "xgyCc5OZuI-YY9ApW9_AJw", "business_id": "jRLskcm_icZIKs81mYC4iQ", "stars": 4, "useful": 3, "funny": 2, "cool": 2, "text": "After finishing my meal at Abyssinia, I sit here thinking to myself and wondering why I have never tried Ethiopian food before. I must say it was quite the experience. I live up on the North Side around 116th & Ditch road and it's a bit of a hike to get down there, but today I said what the heck and headed down to the little strip mall that houses Abyssinia and several other worth while \"joints\" as well! Having never done this I wanted to read up on it a little which actually helped me and I knew what to expect at least as far as tradition went. I chose the spicy lentil pouch to begin. Similar to a beef patty but triangular and stuffed with spicy lentils. This was awesome and piping hot! Then I got a recommendation from the server and ordered the sampler platter. This says, on the menu, that it comes with beef chicken and spinach in various ways of preparation. It sounded very good. Because I've never eaten goat and was a little apprehensive I wanted to stay away from it my first time out. When my order came out it had.... Well..... I really had no idea what it had!!! The dish came served on injera with rolls of Injera on the side. Injera is a very spongy almost rubbery flat bead that has little holes in it like an English Crumpet. The trick is to rip off a piece and scoop up whatever it is you've been eyeing on the dish! This was fun for me because I started to have wondrous flashbacks of all the times my mother would yell at me to get my hands out of the food and here I was digging, scooping and squeezing my way through an absolute heavenly plethora of spices, flavors and self made concoctions from my plate. I was a little afraid to ask what I was eating because it was so good I didn't want to know, YET! Of course I waited till the last piece of injera was gone and tried to eat the flattened out piece on my dish that had been there to form the wonderful spongy cradle soaking up all the flavors. The problem was I was stuffed and couldn't enjoy this last little tidbit. Just for the record, on my plate was some type of curried lamb. I love lamb but this was a little tough ( hence the 4 stars). I feel it could have been cooked to tenderize a little better. Chicken in a dark BBQ looking curry and cumin flavored sauce which was excellent. A sort of creamed but not creamed spinach, if that even makes any sense, at least that's how it tasted. Some curried potatos in the center of the dish several hot spices that I was warned by the server to go easy on (Really not that spicy ) But the best, to my surprise, was the Goat!!! It was extraordinary. So much that I could probably bathe in it. I'm mentally bathing in it right now while  I recount the tender, full of flavor spiced Goat.  Why have I not ever eaten this before. The server was extremely pleasant and attentive and the chef actually came out to my table and asked how I liked everything. I couldn't have like it any more. I will say this, I will come back. I can see me regularly ordering the spiced Goat and indulging with fingers grasping the injera to cradle the love on that plate.", "date": "2011-02-18 11:28:14"}, {"_key": "101393", "_id": "reviews/101393", "_rev": "_fNyp7Ey--k", "review_id": "AcO0-_QTF0Y5Yt5ukpvN6A", "user_id": "iybgPbUG0-LGfyPuCqGJKQ", "business_id": "gUyfJlJRxu1fHuZ4dpBheQ", "stars": 3, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I really loved my house salad with chicken and the tastes that I had of my wife's fish.

See, I always feel like a moose woman in a china shop anyway, or I'm carrying a huge bag that I'm trying not to hit into people with, or I just generally have some other ridiculous issue where a tiny shop can gimme a panic. So, the point is: ahhhh spread out a little. It's the same delicious vegan fast food stylins and salads from your original HipCityVeg; now with more leg room. \n\nAlso, here's another thing, a sidenote to all this limited seating talk. I love the hell outta that udon salad, but I'm one of these people who seem to take forever to eat a damn salad. I have felt much anxiety, self-consciously imagining that those waiting to score my seat are hissing at me in their minds, \"Jeeeeezus, just will this one just take it to go already.\" Neuroses. So you understand what I'm saying. You can at salads at your leisure, or enjoy sweet potato fries and crispy, crispy nuggets at their peak crispiness. Or both. Makes such a difference, I tell you: a lil extra space and maximum crispiness.\n\nSpeaking of making a difference- when they take the time to griddle a little char onto that seitan in the udon salad, I love that. It really gives the protein that grilly somethin somethin. I love it that this arrugula-y salad it's an actual greens-packed salad with noodles in it, rather than, you know, a bigg asss noodle bowl with some greens fluttered lightly in. Listen, I'm all for extra noodle, but, ya know, sometimes your trying to do a thing. Anyway, I enjoy this dish, I do, even if it could use a little less dressing at times. I'm not complaining bout that though, really. So tasty.\n\nIn closing, I'd like to repeat the announcement that the Crispy HipCity Ranch remains my favorite, favorite. It cures a chicken sandwich yen for me, maybe better than a real bird sandwich, even. I have real HipCityVeg hankerings and I find myself coming up with more reasons to head West to University City.

I get it, it's a steakhouse so maybe not for me (a non meat eater). Favorite part was the carrot cake. It was literally like a quarter of a cake. Moistest carrot cake I've ever had, I ate around the icing but everyone loved it. It's a tad expensive (our total was $145 including tip) and again, the atmosphere didn't fit to me.  Not sure I'd go back. They also made several mistakes with our orders but they were corrected (didn't bring salad dressing, left us with meals an no silverware, forgot my friends blue cheese, drinks left at bar forever, etc).

The chorizo patty was nice and crispy on the outside, with a nice juicy center. Our server was also very sweet and attentive. My only issue with this place was the bartender that was working. The ratio of margarita mix to tequila was very inconsistent, with a taste equivalent to overly sweetened lemonade with barely any alcohol. When we kindly requested the bartender add an additional shot (we even stated we were willing to pay extra if we had to), he gave us a sour attitude about it and proceeded to talk about us to his coworker.

This by far makes him my favorite instructor, because this experience is intended to be entertainment, and with him it certainly is. Prior to attending Picasso and Wine, I had never so much as attempted to paint artistically since using a Crayola watercolor box in grade school. Even then, I was frustrated with the lack of ability to convey a mental picture into a physical medium, and quickly gave up on being artistic. But after painting my first canvas here, I was inspired by having learned a few basics and acquired a bit of confidence, so I went out and bought my own paint supplies and began painting at home as a hobby. I have since produced some work that I like enough to hang in my home, and I am grateful to Picasso and Wine for having provided the encouragement to have fun exploring artistic expression.

This place doesn't quite deserve 4 stars.\n\nI decided to try El Camino Real on a Tuesday night since it's impossible to get a table on a weekend (see my review of Bar Ferdinand). \n\nWalking in last night ECR immediately endeared itself to me.  Cibo Matto was playing! Throughout the whole night there was a super fun mix of 80's and 90's music. It was great. Of course it's neither Mexican or Texan, but great nonetheless.  We are in Philly, after all.  I even got the pleasure of watching a server dance like M.C. Hammer. \n\nThe food was delicious.  The pig wings are a stellar idea. Their blue cheese is super strong. The pig wings aren't spicy at all, just wonderfully cooked. My friend and I ordered the brisket sandwich and the short rib sandwich.  We both joked about how the kitchen seemed to throw whatever toppings they felt like on the sandwiches.  The sandwiches are huge, thanks in part to the thick sliced toast. None of the sauces were very hot, but the fries are super spicy. I eventually gave up trying to eat them. \n\nThe place has a great selection of drinks and food.  It's really hard to decide what to order if it's your first time there. The service was decent, if a little slow towards the end.  \n\nThe reason I really want to under-rate ECR is how our leftovers were handled. My friend and I both asked to have our food wrapped up.  We each had half of a sandwich, a plate full of fries, and sauce. So the server packs it up, puts it in a plastic bag and places it all next to my friend.  Now, I think I need to state two things.  One, I was in the bathroom when my friend asked to have the food packed up so I don't really know if something was said and misunderstood. Two, my friend is male and I am female (and super pretty! just kidding). But you can imagine my surprise when we get back to my place and attempt to divvy up the food. \n\nThey use the foil containers that fold over a cardboard top. So they aren't super easy to open and close. The first container is our sauces in two plastic containers. Weird, and annoying since it's a waste of packaging.  The second container was only fries.  Both of our fries, combined! The third container was the top piece of bread to each of our sandwiches.  And finally, the fourth was the bottoms to our sandwiches. I'm not sure why our server decided to combine our meals in so intimate a way.  Maybe he assumed we were a couple and heading to the same place?  Even so, that's pretty brazen, and totally out of the norm. \n\nThe place is so popular on Yelp, I really wanted to love it.

It's actually really refreshing to drink on a very hot day. Mango lassi is very good also, once again with just the right sweetness and enough mango flavour.

Sbraga was a great place for this \"party of one\" to belly up to the Chef's Counter for the $49, four-course prix fixe menu. The atmosphere is dark, contemporary, and lovely. Great for a nice date, a pre-theater meal, small groups, or post-theater drinks (if space is open at the bar).\n\nFirst Course- Foie Gras Soup (with Rose Petal Relish) Wow! So many things going on here, this soup was amazing. Very rich and delicious. FYI, watching the chef's crank out what looked like a delicious Beet Tartar, after Beet Tartar, this was a hard choice to make, but I'm glad I did.\n\nSecond- Grilled Salmon, sprouts and Vadouvan. I live in a \"Vadouvan\" down by the river! My excellent server for the night (she was always on point) described Vadouvan  as an Indian curry-like set of spices. This was a good dish!\n\nThird- Meatloaf, Charcoal Potatoes, scallion and Romesco. Lovely presentation, this one got big ups in Yelp reviews, but I just think it didn't live up to the hype. It didn't wow me, it was just okay.\n\nDessert- Dirt Pudding with homemade Gummy Worms. Since I was basically overlooking the dessert station of the Chef's Counter, I saw a lot of desserts go out. I actually almost ordered off menu after I saw a dish of what looked like three scoops o f berry sorbet on a bed of Pop Rocks go out (off menu). But the Gummy Worms alone, were worth ordering this nice dish. So citrusy, they cut through the chocolate of the Dirt Pudding well. \n\nI loved Sbraga, and there were so many other good looking dishes on the menu, it will get a return visit!", "date": "2013-11-01 17:20:42"}, {"_key": "103468", "_id": "reviews/103468", "_rev": "_fNyp7Hm--F", "review_id": "PSyR084aRNJVdB-AtDnJgg", "user_id": "Vwslifegl59fQVOe5BH1gw", "business_id": "s8KNTkHGjMnzx5zcnWBbwQ", "stars": 4, "useful": 4, "funny": 0, "cool": 3, "text": "I had plans for a tea date with my bestie when we both realized we were starving.

I managed to sneak one bite and I thought it was fine - not outstanding but not bad either.  Wines were well priced and I sipped a lovely glass of pinot noir with my meal. \n\nMy sister and I both started with caesar salads.  Salad was standard but good. My sister tried to order the lobster ravioli but they were out.  Her second choice was the seafood linguine and she was pleased.  I didn't get to taste but I from the looks of the sauce splashing around I think it could have been reduced a little more. Her bf ordered the chicken tortelloni and he devoured it - meaning I didn't get a bite. Again I thought the sauce could have been a bit thicker but that's just what I gathered from the appearance.  I went with the veal scallopine picatta.  I absolutely loved the roasted veg on the side and thought the sauce had a pleasant lemony caperyness to it (yes, I made that word up). The veal I thought was okay but if I were to order the dish again I might go with chicken.  We all shared the tiramisu for dessert and it was another standard but tasty dish.  \n\nWe were there 5:30/6ish and were the only ones in the back dining room at first but as we were finishing up the room was getting more crowded.

I love meat, all kinds of meat, so I didn't think I'd be satisfied with an all veggie sandwich. Govinda's is good, but after eating their chicken cheesesteaks again and again, you'll realize that you're just eating bread (seitan) with bread (the bun or wrap) with a small helping of peppers. The focus is not on the seitan or soy meat but on all of the delicious, wonderful ingredients that are married to it. For fast (or speedy) food, this is really good. The Crispy HipCity Ranch is also delish. The Bella Bistro is a big portabella mushroom sandwich. Many vegetarians will claim that portabella mushrooms taste almost exactly like beef. It doesn't. It's good, but to call it beef would be insulting to both beef and mushrooms. The Bella Bistro is a nice, hearty sandwich filled with plenty of red onions and artichokes, a couple of slices of tomato (from possibly a small beefsteak tomato), arugala, and olive tampenade all in a big multi-grain roll. Be forewarned, your breath will stink of onions when you're done, but it's sooo good. The Fajita Wrap with its blackened soy chicken, peppers, onions, pico de gallo, and avocado is a little more forgiving. The use of intense flavors in both sandwiches masks the fact that you're not eating meat. The Buffalo Bella is another yummy. I find myself ordering the Philly Steak quite often these days because of its delicious mix of soy meat, mushrooms, and onions. The Jerk Caesar Salad is my only nonfave so far. There's too much salad compared to the protein portion. Give this place a try. The servers are friendly, which makes the wait in the occasionally long lines bearable. It's not exactly a sit-down place as there is limited seating, but on a warm, sunny day, I can think of few places around Rittenhouse Square that can provide you with a more satisfying sandwich that you can enjoy while sitting in the park people-watching.

So one of my friends went on Priceline and got this 4-star Downtown hotel for approximately $70 after taxes for several December nights.\n\nThe good:\n*Front desk was efficient and effective. I was not the primary roomholder, but I didn't have any trouble checking in. However, we needed to actually extend this staycation extension also without the primary roomholder, so it was a bit tricky to change the name of the room over to another person. They handled it with aplomb. \n*We got connecting rooms without much trouble.\n*The rooms are comfortable, clean, and nice. It's a solid hotel room. Some rooms have a straight on view of the Arch (not ours). \n*The bathrooms are nice in that they have an extra sink outside of the main bathroom. I love that kind of stuff. But they were kind of stingy on the towels. Three bath towels for a two queen bed room? How does that work out?\n*They have amenities galore if you've forgotten toiletries at home...and believe me, I had. It's also a really nice touch that when you call for them, they call you by the roomholder's name. \n*Really nice 24 hour fitness center including water, cold wet towels, and earphones. \n\nThe bad:\n*It's not that quiet. I was reminded of my college days in Chicago...all night, I heard the traffic even though our room was facing 4th instead of the highways.\n*Parking is $28 for valet, $8 for self parking. Rumor has it there is a $3 garage north on 4th, but we never found it. We usually did street parking because we were gone all day and back after 7 PM.\n*Internet is $10/day, but free in the hotel lobby. \n*Obviously, since it's a nice hotel, the attached restaurants have pretty high prices for average food. They are a couple of choices from Ruth's Chris to Red to a sports bar (which does have a free foosball table) to Starbucks. \n*They do take a while to clean a room. I'm not sure why. One day, we came back to find them cleaning the room, so we decided to go out for a late lunch. Three hours later, they were just finishing up the room. \n*The key cards stopped working midway in our stay.

We actually found a spot right next to the elevator that took us up to the entrance of the museum, so that was a good start to our visit! Parking would have been quite expensive for the garage, but the museum validated our ticket so that we could leave the garage for free - another plus :) On the negative side, I thought the admission tickets for the museum were kind of pricy: $15 for an adult ticket? Not outrageous, but a bit more than I expected for a pretty small museum.\n\nAnyway, we paid for our tickets and began our visit with the \"Reel West\" special exhibit. This could be a generational thing (I'm in my early 30s), but I thought this exhibit was super boring. It seems like this exhibit, which includes various mementos and outfits from old Westerns, would be interesting to older people that grew up watching the relevant TV shows and movies, but it was not interesting to me at all. Maybe just an issue of personal taste, though.\n\nOur next room contained some really nice paintings of Western landscapes and Native Americans as well as a few interesting sculptures, so that improved my mood quite a bit. Unfortunately, the neighboring room was under construction or something, so we likely missed out on some other good pieces.\n\nWe then went down to the lower level of the museum, but it didn't seem to contain anything interesting, so we journeyed up to the top (and final) floor of the museum. There was definitely a lot of content up there, so I'm glad we checked it out! First, there were at least a couple of rooms dedicated to one particular Native American artist - unfortunately, I was not a huge fan of his work. Some of it was pretty good (the abstract paintings, for example), but a lot of his work consisted of poorly drawn coyotes. I'm not trying to be a jerk, and it's possible that the true meaning of his work just flew right over my head, but that was my interpretation of what I saw :) So many pictures of coyotes!\n\nThe remaining part of the museum contained a lot of artifacts and objects created by different Native American tribes. That part was pretty interesting as well, although I tend to prefer paintings over artifacts/objects, so I wasn't super captivated. After finishing up with the actual exhibits, we checked out the gift shop, and while we didn't buy anything, it had a pretty good selection of stuff to purchase.\n\nOverall, I can't imagine I'd ever come back here. I am interested in Native American and old Western culture, but only as much as I'm interested in most other things, and there are lots of other museums to check out in the world. That being said, if you're particularly fascinated by the themes explored by the work in this museum, then I definitely recommend you go, as there's a good amount of content and some of it is pretty cool!", "date": "2018-06-28 20:03:22"}, {"_key": "104020", "_id": "reviews/104020", "_rev": "_fNyp7IW--S", "review_id": "OUsGaWVMMsG39PxH9btE8A", "user_id": "3tAW8YObI7gpFggazZEsOg", "business_id": "Fok0BLJP0OMxbbl3l6QmZA", "stars": 5, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "text": "I freaking love Sauce on the Side.

I felt adventurous, but NOT that adventurous to go too far.\n\nAfter living in the Tower Grove area for nearly 2 years, I finally decided to give Black Thorn a shot. All I've heard were good things minus the long wait people usually endure when coming here.\n\nJason and I got here around 7:30. To our surprise there was not a line nor was it insanely busy like we had anticipated. Another thing we had not anticipated was the set up of the place.\n\nYou have to place your order at the bar, get your own drinks from the bar, and pay all before you receive your pizza if you aren't going to keep an open tab. It basically has the same concept as a Bread Co. or Qdoba. Once you order, they'll bring you your pizza out.\n\nWe ordered a 12 inch Chicago style sausage and pepperoni pizza and a bowl of caesar salad to hold us over until the pizza came out. Little did we know that we were going to wait 30 minutes to receive the salad, then an additional 30 minutes after that for our pizza. As mentioned before, it was not busy. It had a few patrons, but not enough to cause the wait like we had to.\n\n8:30pm. Pizza is out. We're ready and holy hot damn, am I excited! The pizza lived up to the hype I had hoped for. The time spent waiting was well worth every bite I ate. I think the only downside is the wait time. I don't know how long it takes to cook the pizzas. I'd assume awhile considering how thick the crusts are, but still, could they not have told us?\n\nAs far as the attitude of the bartender, I have to agree with Aimee K. The girl looked like she had a blank stare on her face, and she didn't seem too pleasant to talk to. I asked her when our salad was going to come out, and her reply was, \"when we get to it.\" I went back to my seat and continued to wait without questioning. I didn't want anything to happen to our beloved deep dish pizza!\n\nAnyway, aside from that, I like Black Thorn. The rustic looking 1980s dive bar setting who outlived its hay day truly adds character to this place. It has darts, hurling, and a juke box.

I take exception here as I feel as if someone just gifted me with my NYC/Soho Pegu Club twin and saved me a roundtrip ticket and the horror of JFK/LGA. some striking similarities btwn the two that pleases me greatly.\n\nWe went as a couple around 8.30pm on a Wednesday. Had no problems getting in and finding a table, there were also plenty of open seats at the bar. \n\nLocation: down the street from Fogo & Mortons, around the corner from the crazy Dunkin Donuts on Penn, i.e. located just off a corner block-- so it's easy to stumble out and get a cab; or, park in the convenient public garage across the street.\n\nAmbiance: It is not 'lounge-ish', but relaxed & enjoyable nonetheless. It is a longish room, high loft ceilings, modern clean lines, grays and whites, soft lighting. Not too dark where you can't read the menu, not too bright where the mood is shattered. not too big not too small, trendy but not too cheesy I'm-trying-to-impress-you, not too loud that you can't hold a conversation without losing your voice, not too hushed that you feel awkward laughing outloud, high end but not pretentious. Bartenders in uniforms of vests and newsboy caps. Great place to come on your own, with a small group of friends, or on a date.  NOT a place to come to get rowdy.  \n\nService: The host greeted us with a welcoming smile, bartenders were all smiles and seemed to love what they were doing.  Waiter was extremely attentive, competent, and well-informed on all menu items.  No condescending or impatient attitudes anywhere.\n\nPrice: As mentioned by others, slightly higher prices but at this joint you know you are getting quality. And it caters to that clientele that can appreciate that distinction. I feel the price is right.\n\nDrinks: The drink menu is a work of art. This is not your average bar-- this is not even your average artisanal bar. This place serves up another realm in a glass. Excellent handcrafted concoctions. The menu is categorized by the main spirit-- i.e., gin, whiskey, rum, tequila, vodka, and yes, absinthe. You will find your classics as well as some more intriguing choices. The drinks are made of the finest ingredients, and each drink is precisely as you have wished it when placing your order.  Their signature, the Seelbach, was a successful delicious start.  Every drink thereafter was also divine. You can tell they really put time & effort in making their cocktails.  All are beautiful and there's an elegance to them.  Many come with very nice in-house steeped fruits & syrups. They do offer a fine wine and beer list but I could have cared less.  You want beer, go to Twenty-tap or Tomlinson. You want wine, go to Corner Wine Bar... or find your Opus at Kahns across the way.\n\nFood: Delicious small plates. Again, obvious invested thought, quality, and careful preparation here. I recommend getting food if you sit at a table. We had duck meatballs w gnocchi in a wonderful jus/sauce, 3-bacon flight w/ condiment sides of aioli/beets/horseradish-ketchup, lamb rilette w shallots/mustard/ super thin crostini, and the perfectly grilled one-eyed jack with fig jam & roasted garlic. the bacon (from Smoking Goose) was my favorite. Everything was delicate yet hearty, if that makes any sense. Next time I'm going for the apple salad, mushroom salad, beef tataki, and either the pate or one of the sandwiches.  We saw others getting the oysters. \n\nLittle Touches: white cloth napkins. fresh herb garnishes. check out the quirky personalized coasters. the postcard that comes with your bill. the pretty orange peel zest. \n\nSynopsis: 5 stars. I loved everything about this place. Yes, more than both Ball & Biscuit and Black Market.  Easily.  If you enjoy quality cocktails in a mature, urbane setting, this will quickly become a new favorite... I know I'll be a regular at The Libertine.", "date": "2011-11-04 20:21:57"}, {"_key": "104581", "_id": "reviews/104581", "_rev": "_fNyp7JK--Y", "review_id": "Fs-nvuNhQ2vyYv1DWpfN2w", "user_id": "tmsHu3v6Ot6emPzHxBgsrw", "business_id": "tr366vgAkbcpJBVKSdBxZg", "stars": 4, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "Alberto's was my go to place when I was still in school because it opens until midnight and it's cheap!

I think it's the sexy sorghum glazed bacon, yes, most definitely the bacon and probably the Sweet Tea Fried Chicken and the Dutch Baby Cornmeal Pancake but most definitely the bacon. \n\nHere's the nitty-gritty:\n\nSpace/Ambiance - Open, inviting, and captivating. From the coffee bar to the open concept kitchen \"to the windows to the walls\" there is something magically creative happening here and it's exciting just to sit back and watch. \n\nDrinks - A wide and vast assortment ranging from artfully presented espresso drinks and pour overs, to cocktails, beer, and wine. I might be so bold to say their latte is one of the best I have had in a long time. The presentation and the addition of Traders Point Creamery milk adds a special local touch. The bottomless house brewed coffee on the other hand was a bit strong for my liking, but wasn't undrinkable, just a bit too rich for me. I have not yet had the pleasure to enjoy one of their cocktails. I do have my eye on the White Bloody Mary. Next time! \n\nFood - I have tried the Sweet Tea Fried Chicken, Belgian Waffle, Dutch Baby Pancake (sweet variation), Uova AL Forno w/grilled Merguez Sausage, Sorghum Glazed Bacon, and the Chocolate Shortbread. The Sweet Tea Fried Chicken is a great dish and is consistently delicious. The gravy and chicken pair so well together like a perfect harmony. If you order the Uova Al Forno add the Sausage. It definitely adds to the dish bringing in great flavors. I really enjoyed the Dutch Baby Pancake & Belgian Waffle but felt the portion size was small without the addition of a accompaniment from the adjacent menu. This can be good or bad depending on how you look at it. Good if you want to pair a few dishes together but bad if your on a budget.\n\nMy Experience - Most recently I decided to share Milktooth with family which included my dad who is the pickiest eater on earth. He simply refuses to eat anything green and sneers at ingredients like pickled avocado and clementine confit. Knowing full well \"modifications are politely declined\" I was a little uneasy and had my fingers crossed that he too would have a pleasant experience. To my amazement the man who hates most food groups loved his Belgian Waffle! Hallelujah there is hope!\n\nSpecial Notes - I like that you can enjoy a coffee and/or pastry while waiting for your table.

We bought the living social from a few weeks back ($15 for $30 to spend) and tonight we finally cashed it in.  We decided pretty last minuted to go out to dinner and called them a little after 7pm (on a Friday!).  They sounded crazy busy on the phone but said we could come at 8:30.  We showed up a few minutes before and the place was pretty full (and they were setting up for a large group which took up 3-4 tables).  We had to wait about 15min for some tables to clear out and we ended up at the sushi bar.  \n\nThe menu is pretty huge and they have sushi and non sushi options (bi bim bap,udon, terriyaki etc).  We went for sushi so that's what we spent the most time pondering.  The place was super busy and it took them a little bit to take our order, but one of the sushi makers was super on top of things and had someone come over as soon as he noticed we were no longer absorbed in the menu choices.  We started with the veggie tempura which was well done and the dipping sauce was really tasty (more like a broth than a sauce).  There was carrot, sweet potato, asparagus, onion, broccoli, and cucumber.  Yum!  \n\nFor the sushi we got: Raw Viking Roll, The Stallion Roll, Sweet Potato Tempura Roll (I loveee sweet potatoes), and a normal yellowtail roll.  I have to say they were all well done.  I hadn't had torched sushi before so the Stallion was my first time, I was a little wary since I generally prefer raw fish to cooked fish but it was soooo good!  \n\nSo after this great experience, we decided to keep it going and ordered the tempura vanilla ice cream.  It was HUGE.  At $8 I was a little wary of ordering it since I figured it would be small, but goodness did they give us a ton.  It was gorgeously presented with fresh cut strawberries, and giant mounds of both tempura ice cream and whipped cream.  I can't believe we finished it, but I'll admit that we did.  I wish we had taken pictures of everything, but we both left our phones behind so that we wouldn't get distracted (ok really I just forgot my damn phone!).  \n\nAfter all of this the bill was only $60 ($55 pre tax).  After the living social was applied it was only $30, yayyyyyy.  Had it been a little less busy it would have been perfect.

He noticed that they only did NY-style by-the-slice, but he was really craving STL-style (since he's new to the area and had JUST tried it for the first time the prior weekend). Apparently, National was pretty dead, so he figured he'd go ahead and ask if they could do a STL-style slice. They said, \"sure, why not?\" and told him to come back in about fifteen. He wandered around Grand for a minute and came back, only to be surprised with a full-on medium pizza! I got to try it for dinner (since his lunch provided leftovers), and it was great! It's not the best STL-style pizza, but it's awesome that they were so nice and flexible and I'm sure they'll get into their groove in due time.

Caesar didn't appeal to me, so I opted for a House salad (the small is $3.95 and the large is $5.95 + tax). I didn't know which dressing I wanted between two of them, so they were gracious enough to just give me one of each. I also don't eat pepperoni, nor do I particularly care for cherry tomatoes, so they happily left both items off the salad. What I got wound up being just mixed greens, grated provel cheese, croutons, and dressing...but it was actually a REALLY good salad. (I took it home and tossed it together in my own big bowl.)

The Opera cake and croissants were as good if not better than what could be found in the best of pastry shops in France. \n\nThe chocolate croissant was decadent, filled with delicious dark chocolate and the texture of the croissant was flaky and crispy. A perfectly made pastry.\n\nThe ham and cheese croissant was filled with delicious ham and gruyere cheese. Fantastic. \n\nAnd the opera cake? Don't get me started on the opera cake. It had layer upon layer of sweet and delicious fillings and cake. The bf swears that Maple Street Patisserie's version is better than anything that could be found in Paris. \n\nAll in all, Maple Street Patisserie is a fantastic option for any pastry lover.

Their plants are just so sad. There's no love, only a giant corporate box store and their giant corporate farms located who knows where. The quality at GoB is sooooo much better than most garden centers I've been in. The plants are well taken care of and you can tell just by looking at them. The plants are shipped across the country, they don't arrive dried and shriveled up. I find plants that have gone through this end up being dried and shriveled up, or over watered. They usually die within a month. Now to be fair I'm a terrible gardener, I have no green thumb to speak of. But the hostas and caladiums we bought from GoB this past spring are still trying to sprout and it's December! I certainly know I forgot to water them quite frequently during the blistering summer, but they never died! That's what I mean by quality. We bought the plants when they were tenderly taken care of at the store, so when they came home with us they already had a good chance of survival.This past summer I was impressed with their home gardening options, including veggies, lettuces, strawberries and other plants that you can start growing in your own backyard. They also had a bunch of really cool herbs that you can't find at the grocery store. \n\nWe recently came back to GoB to get our first Christmas tree. They are grown right here in Tennessee, ethically. Plus a portion of the profits goes to the TN Environmental Council. Take that home depot. PLUS their trees all get names!

We laughed our asses off. Don't get me wrong, there were sexy moments too. And live singing, which I definitely wasn't expecting! The show featured characters like Beast, Ursula, and Maleficent. Maleficent and Ursula, both drag performers, were absolutely fantastic. I really liked the balance of men, women, and drag that were all here. Way to be inclusive, 708!\n\nWe also had drinks. Two (of the four) of us were a little bummed because we wanted to try a cocktail called the Cruella de Ville, but they were out of one of the ingredients. It was a definite bummer but, stuff happens. Our \"cocktail kitten\" (I believe her name was Serenity?) was super sweet and apologetic about it. Instead I had a Lost Boy and a Tarzan, both were well poured and good, though I preferred the Lost Boy. I loved that the servers were dressed in burlesque style outfits as well- the one dressed like Alice is stunning. Our server was super cool about taking the Yelp discount, and was just overall really attentive and nice. \n\nAfter the show, we grabbed a few drinks at the bar. The bartender was super nice and attentive. The cocktail kittens were friendly and energetic and danced and talked with us, which I appreciated because all four of us were women. I was happy to see that they weren't just focusing on the men (which I've seen at other bars). I took a selfie with one of them, and she let us know if we checked in on Facebook we'd get a free shot. Which, who says no to a free shot?\n\nWe wandered outside to drink, and it was just a really great night. I'm not from the area, and have never been on that block in STL before.

Roxie Bagels, daughter of NJ mobster Tony Bagels, is one tough cat!  She has a clubbed foot, I'm guessing it stems from an altercation back up north.\n\nNo but really, my boyfriend brought me to the NHA to cheer me up.  The NHA was clean, friendly, and had a pet for everyone.  I especially like that it is a no-kill shelter.  So I made it out of the cat room, it was tough, I wanted to adopt like 4 of the cats.  Then I headed over to the dog room and they had puppies!!!  Awww.....on my way out of the dog room I found my boyfriend upfront in the first room when you walk in.  Inside was Roxie, cat of the week.  She was up on his lap and rubbing her head into his arm.  She was adorable.  We left that Saturday and I could not stop thinking about her.  So cute!!  The next day I submitted an application.  She had been in the shelter for months and I knew we were the right home for her.  I was able to pick her up the following weekend, thankfully no one adopted her that week.  They gave me all of her paperwork in a nice neat packet with some really informative reading material.  It took a few days for her to acclimate but now she's part of the family.  She plays hard and we love that!!  She naps on her window seat and even sleeps with us most nights.  What I love even more is that the NHA called a week later to follow up.

We were here for UC Dining Days and the dishes were great.  I had the chicken satay app with the red curry chicken, and found both to be very good.  The satay was juicy and flavorful with a great peanut dipping sauce, and the curry was very solid although it wasn't very spicy.  I also had a few bites of the triple flavor tilapia in the sweet and sour sauce, and really like the crispy, pan-seared fillet combined with the garlicky sauce.  Will definitely have to get this next time.  Most restaurants like to fry the fillet when they make a sweet and sour dish but pan searing actually brings out the flavor more and gives that delicious crispy exterior without killing your arteries.  We finished off with the mango sticky rice and coconut rice pudding.  While the mango sticky rice was very good, I liked the coconut rice pudding more because I love all things coconut and this was a delicious coconut-based concoction.  If you are in the area this week, and need to grab a bite, definitely stop in for the $15 dining days special.  It's a great deal and the food is very good.  They also have homemade beef jerky at $6/order, which I couldn't resist getting to-go; while it wasn't as fantastic as my aunt's homemade jerky, the meat was very well-marinated and flavorful and great paired with the accompanying chili paste.

Parmesan garlic wings with fries and ranch dressing.  The combo was $6.99, and an extra 70 cents or so for a large ranch dressing (bummer to charge extra for it!).  Dinner companion (DC) ordered the chicken strips in the Hot Mama! sauce, with mashed potato.\n\nThe wings took 10 minutes to cook, and when they came out they looked pretty tempting.  Big pieces of parmesan, but not drowning in sauce.  Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, just like they should be.  The size of the wings varied pretty widely.  I had a 5 piece and 3 were what I'd consider normal while 2 were considerably smaller.  I was pretty disappointed with the taste though.  They weren't very flavorful.  Not much garlic at all, and I love garlic.  The fries were just plain fries with some seasoned salt.. not the magical awesomeness of Wingstop fries.  \n\nDC was kind enough to let me try his boneless wings (a rarity, to talk him into sharing!!)  They were strangely thin pieces of chicken, in almost a tempura type batter.  Bonus points for that, since most breaded tenders are overwhelmingly breaded.  The Hot Mama! sauce was pretty good, started out with a sweet honey taste and quickly transitioned over to a heat.  Too spicy for me (I'm a total spice wimp) but a tasty few bites.\n\nOverall, DC and I agreed we still like Wingstop better for now.

Living in Bensalem there are a ton of chain restaurants in the area, so it is hard to find a good mom & pop place, but even harder to find a good BBQ place. The famous one is Smoken Dudes around town, and I was not really impressed by the taste or the prices, so I'm glad that we saw the sign for Ben's BBQ - which by the way is VERY easy to miss, since it is located inside the hotel and the sign is not upfront in on Street Road at all, so make sure you just pull into the Best Western Hotel after the Dunkin Donuts.\n\nAlright, well the location situation aside, because it is kind of awkward to walk into a hotel and not be staying there, but walk into the back just to eat. The restaurant area looks like a hotel lobby that wasn't given the full permission to be a BBQ pit. I was thrown off by that situation a lot, especially because it didn't even smell like BBQ! But, loyal to my review reading, I still decided to give it a shot. There was a wonderful bartender, an older woman, who was taking our order and gave us great recommendations. \n\nI decided to go with the coffee rubbed brisket - because omg that sounded amazing and the hubby went with the smoked sausage which was keilbasa for the day. Let's just say if I could eat this coffee smoked brisket everyday for the rest of my life, it might still not be enough! It was melt in your mouth good, with a smokey, but sweet flavor, just perfection. The hubby's kielbasa was great flavor too, neither one of us wanted to share our plates! As for the sides, the Mac n cheese was creamy and out of this world! And the baked beans were like I've never had, also amazing. We both got platters, which were good sizes, but enough for one person on the meats. They do give you 3 sides, which is awesome, I could've probably just done with 2. \n\nAs we licked our plates from the delicious meal, our Bartender told us the history of Ben's BBQ and how they went from a station in the corner of the lobby to a full restaurant recently. The owner also has a catering business that does well. She told us about their craft beer selection and how everyday is happy hour with $4 16oz crafts!

I wanted to try as many dishes as possible so I opted out of the entree and instead ordered several appetizers. For our main dishes we ordered the calamari, saganaki and bureki and the lamb kofta entree. \n\nThe Calamari was served with a side of Armenian tomato dip. It was perfectly cooked and tasted light, crispy and tender.Next up was the Saganaki- a favorite of mine. The pan friend halloumi cheese was served in ouzo and lemon sauce with a delicious caramelized fig and side salad. This was one of the best I've had...including those which were devoured on many restaurants in Athens, Mykonos and Paros.  The Bureki was served next: a fillo pastry parcel stuffed with feta and thyme drizzled with honey served with a side of roasted beats. The presentation was so beautiful with a taste to match. Crispy layers of fillo oozing with feta cheese. The Count found that the honey made it more appropriate for dessert but I loved it, especially the presentation.\n\nThe lamb kofta was served next. It was a skewer of ground lamb kofta mixed with apricot and pistachios served with a  side of pomegranate salad, lentils and Greek yogurt. The lamb was excellent filled with magic flavors. But what truly made it special were the side dishes. The pomegranate salad was so original. I've never had pomegranate served as a salad as in Iran it tends to be eaten as a fruit or juiced. The mixture of pomegranate with onions and spices was excellent. Then there was the lentil salad which was again a first for me. I mixed spoonfuls of the kabob, pomegranate and lentil salad together and found the combination to be intoxicating. The quality of the ingredients are present in each spoonful. You can tell that the chef really prides himself on his food. \n\nFor dessert we ordered the pistachio and olive oil cake and warm chocolate mousse. Both desserts were out of this world. I really loved the pistachio cake it was light yet intense in flavors served with a side of pistachio ice cream and cherries.  The Chocolate mousse was baked to perfection oozing with warm gooey chocolate served with a scoop of ice cream. Wow. Is all I can say about this restaurant. I loved the food, the presentation and the friendly chef. Kanella offers rustic home-made dishes with fresh and mostly organic ingredients.

They also have roasted peanuts at every table (and also two very large barrel-fulls of the roasted peanuts at the entrance/waiting area).

I had a great time and I hope they are planning to do it again, as I will be back.\n\nSacred Journeys started off with a complimentary drink token, to which I indulged in some red wine. From there, the open bar was $5 for drinks (Im not sure if it was an all inclusive price...they had Sun King beer and wine). There was small table with lightweight snacks for dining, but the food and drinks were not allowed into the exhibit. Pretzels, chips, hummus and pita bread, fried wontons and spinach artichoke dip and some mini pizza bagels lined up the table for guests to cure their stomach rumblings. I admit to over indulging on the pizza bites.\n\nI unfortunately only saw two of the exhibits, which means they either have to do this again OR I will have to go on my own and deal with the big laugh & play time of the children. Seeing two of the exhibits and not even in their full capacity just opened up the Pandora Children's Museum Box that now says I MUST SEE MORE!!!!! \n\nI visited Sacred Journeys, which is really incredible, interactive exhibit about five different areas of the world that people journey off to in order to celebrate their  religion. The long corridor that leads you into the exhibit has a looped video playing that gives you the synopsis of what you will see. Once you turn the corner, all colors of religion, spirituality and love shining. They even had the throne that the Dali Lama sat on in a glass encasing. Pretty cool ! I didn't see the entire exhibit as I was called away but what I did see, I loved !!! I love that the kids have a space that teaches them ABOUT religion and the differences in people, all while showing some of the most beautiful parts of the world. \n\nThe other exhibit I checked out was the Beijing exhibit which comes complete with a replica airplane that flies you into the Beijing while you feel the vibrations of the chair and see the amazing sights that you would see out your window if you were really flying. Once you get off the plane, an entire world opened up ! There was everything, themed and precise, including a grocery store, a Saigon theater, a house, restaurant and much much more. You are really allowed an authentic experience of life in Beijing if you were to travel there. Me and my group had a ball in this area playing dress up, taking pictures and learning to write calligraphy and say hello in native tongue.\n\nUpon leaving, we were asked to sign up on their email list. The ladies told us there would be more of these events in the future!

I have dissected it and all but looked at it under a microscope, and it's a total culinary revelation.  It even reheats well for next day lunch leftovers.  The fajita wrap is super flavorful, and the veggie burger, though not as inexplicably identical to its carnivorous counterpart as the crispy chick'n, is meaty and hearty.  Sweet potato fries are good - pretty standard - but what makes them unique is the dipping sauce, a whipped concoction of savory cilantro goodness.

Based on what a great experience I had last year, I had to come back to Tampa again this year for the same event. I was excited that I knew exactly which hotel I wanted to stay at. It was very easy to book, which I was surprised about because there are so many people usually here for the festival. It ended up being at maximum capacity when I got here. The hotel itself, is just as lovely as it was before. I think there is always something special about it being brand-new, for the first time which, this experience, of course was not. The check in process was easy. I got there a day before all of the kids so it wasn't crazy. Unfortunately Tampa was experiencing unusually cold weather for this time of year. There was no time to enjoy the pool. I still love the location, I had to work at the convention center and at the Straz Performing Arts Center. It's about smack dab in the middle so that was perfect. Also walking distance to the downtown area, lots of restaurants and such. The food in the bar/restaurant is not good but the service is ok. The breakfast in the morning is a disaster! The lady is so rude & slow. No respect! They never have anything you need & always out of coffee. The service is just not great here. It was dirty & gross. The rooms are nice-again, ask for the Riverwalk view. Expect pizza delivery menus everyday under your door. You can get a $5 Voucher or 250 SPG awards if you opt out of cleaning service. That's new from last year! I definitely took advantage of that. Don't expect anyone down at Valet to be friendly or ask you if you need help with anything either.

I think the execution could be a little better if it were a little less sweet.  But honestly a donut with jalapenos has already won me over.\n4) Huskey Boy - the peanut butter and chocolatey heaven :) (Not my personal fav... but everyone in our group loooved this!!!)\n5) Gooey Butter - very creamy and rich.  Great for splitting, but there was no way I would be able to finish the entire thing myself.\n6) Blueberry - pretty good, but nothing out of the ordinary.  It's your typical run-of-the-mill blueberry flavored donut\n7) Blueberry Cheesecake - interesting take on the blueberry; the cheesecakiness was creamy and smooth. A little heavy for my personal taste, but it was still great!\n8) Fat Steve - I probably wouldn't order this again personally. There was nothing really wrong with it.

Didn't need excuses, the apology would have sufficed.

There are also two large, clean bathrooms with showers. Each classroom has yoga accessories that you may need during your class including yoga blocks, mats, yoga straps, eye pillows, bolster pillows,  and blankets. Each instructor varies what you may need but you always find out when you walk into class. Every instructor teaches a little differently. I didn't find any that I didn't like.

We had ventured from Derby City (Louisville, if you didn't know), along miles of wretched Interstate 65, to Indy in order to see the Varekai production of Cirque du Soleil. We had already made reservations at another (I won't name names) steak house for 8:15 pm. The show let out at 6, so we had some time to kill...we wandered. We browsed a couple bars, having a drink at one. But, as 7:00 approached, we happened upon a place called \"Mo's, A Place For Steaks\". I said \"hey, I bet they have good martinis. We can stop in and have a couple drinks while we wait for reservation time to roll around\".\n\nSo, we went it. We were quickly greeted by a friendly hostess who seated us at the bar, where we met one of their excellent bartenders, Keith. I had one of the best Manhattans I've had in a long time, which means a lot coming from a whiskey snob. We chatted with Keith and the other bartender, Bridgette, who was equally amazing and gave us some great ideas for places to check out for fun night life activities. Then, we got some great input on our dining choices from some regulars, which led to a change in plans.\n\nAfter ordering another drink, I asked the lovely hostess if we might be able to get a table, even without reservations. She checked with the manager, who gladly accommodated us. So, we cancelled our reservations at *anonymous steakhouse*, and took a nice corner table for two near the window.\n\nWe met the two marvelous ladies who would be serving us that evening, the lovely Chelsea and Ruby. They were on top of everything from the moment we sat down, to the moment we left.\n\nFirst, I perused the wine list, stopping almost immediately on the glass of Caymus Cabernet, and was informed of a special 40th anniversary liter bottle they had. Guess which way I went? Nectar of the gods!\n\nSo now, it was time to actually consider food, now that the important choice had been made. We started with the Kung Pao Calamari, which was at least twice as good as imagined...a perfect heat level blended with the slightly sweet sauce over perfectly cooked, crispy calamari.\n\nThen...the harder decision came: our entrees. But, we selected the Grilled Breast of Chicken, and the Bone-In Filet.\n\nI don't believe in ordering chicken in any place known as \"a place for steaks\", but I have to say that it was mighty good. Well seasoned, cooked, accompanied and presented. It was an excellent choice for the bird lovers of the world.\n\nThe filet...was PERFECT. Perfectly aged. Perfectly seasoned. Perfectly cooked. I ordered it medium rare and oscar style, and was amazed from the first bit to the last. I was going to lick the plate and chew on the bone, but was told that was not appropriate public behavior, so...\n\nWith a steak that good, you probably could care less to hear about my side dish, but you get to anyway. I went with the sauteed spinach, which was super yummy. Perfectly cooked in a balsamic sauce.\n\nNeedless to say, I will return here on my next trip up to Indy. Next time, I want to give the scallops a shot, even though it breaks my \"only eat steak at a steakhouse\" rule.\n\nSo...ignore the previous review. If there were kinks before, they certainly have worked them out.", "date": "2014-07-31 19:01:30"}, {"_key": "108097", "_id": "reviews/108097", "_rev": "_fNyp7N2--S", "review_id": "SJ-mamT77icCa9RFm6yIsw", "user_id": "Xaa12Zr3gzCvT9-8UAljZQ", "business_id": "m1ohyfs8gcS9X-ZQ3Coj2Q", "stars": 3, "useful": 0, "funny": 2, "cool": 0, "text": "I have a love/hate relationship with this food truck.

I enjoyed my stay at this hotel, I tend not to when there's a casino involved but I've learned to let my bf enjoy gambling while I enjoy sleep.

Not to mention slides of Seattle which is where I'm pining to live. The large tvs are everywhere in the hotel/casino, it gives you something to look at while in line for the buffet, waiting for someone or when people watching isn't enough. We skiied for 2 days out of our 4 day trip and the Mt Rose shuttle picked us up directly in front of the hotel (in an airport shuttle, FYI: the REAL airport shuttle says Peppermill on it!) One of the first nights, we wandered around and found the bar across Biscotti's with music and singers, those singers can sing! I loved the rendition of Tainted Love. The trumpet player could use a little practice though, his playing was over powering and choppy when I think he meant to compliment the song with accents. The bar stocked Yamazaki whiskey which has been a fun find for my bf. The Island Buffet was ok, I wouldn't stand in line for it again, although there were a ton of various crab dishes and crab legs available. The spa was AMAZING.

Completely. Obviously Frost has struck a chord here in Tucson, with all of its fans giving high reviews here and its many franchised stores. Me thinks that many, if most, have not tried Allegro's.\n\nOK, I start sampling flavors. I think I'm going to try as many in-common flavors as Allegro's for a fun comparison. Start with one of my perennial favorites--salted caramel. Yuck. Tastes artificial. OK, cinnamon next. Nope. The same. This is not good. Two of what should be home run flavors foul out. Maybe a fruit flavor will be better. Strawberry. Ugh. Tastes like grocery strawberries. (Coming from CA, that's NOT a compliment. How *does* Ivan at Allegro Gelato get his to taste so much like fresh CA freshberries?!!!) Only three flavors and already my mouth is \"frosted.\"\n\nMy wife tried Peanut Butter Crunch, Pumpkin, and Cinnamon. She said they all kind of tasted the same. She loves anything peanut butter. She passes.\n\nShe ends up with Cookies and Cream. It's OK. In desperation, I try chocolate. Acceptable.\n\nAfter experiencing Allegro Gelato, it was disconcerting to watch them just slap the gelato in the cup. Almost unappetizing. I'm thinking, \"You're not slinging mortar to lay bricks! Isn't your product better than that?\"\n\nI liked the flakes of chocolate in my flavor. It gave it a little nice texture to it. But let's compare other qualities. The texture of Frost in this chocolate was not bad. The texture in the other flavors were more \"airy\" than at Allegro. One thing that struck me was that with Allegro's gelato, there is a wonderful after taste that lingers on the taste buds like a romantic memory on my palate. 'Twas not so with Frost. The flavor was only present when it was in my mouth.\n\nLike Allegro, Frost has a round cookie (see photos) they put in the cup of gelato. It is a cheaper cookie than the hazelnut cream filled pirouettes you get at Allegro. I mean it's a good cookie, but I'm comparing here, and it is not of the quality at Allegro.\n\nThe spoons. Ah, here is where they outshine Allegro. They are multi-colored mini spade-like paddle things. And bigger than what Allegro uses. They are kind of cool.\n\nPrices are comparable with Allegro. Service is really good. My server always called me \"sir.\" Many employees on a Friday night made for fast service.\n\nSo bottom line is Frost is OK. At least the chocolate. The rest tastes like medicine to me. Will you Frost fans, who obviously have fallen in love with gelato, go give Ivan's gelato a try?

Pretty impressive being that they just opened. On top of that, every worker I've encountered has been nothing but nice and well informed. \n\nMy favorite sandwich is the #2  spicy deluxe sandwich with Chick fil A sauce. It's so spicy, but in a good way. Eating the juicy spicy chicken patty along with the buns, cheese, tomato, lettuce and sauce is just the best. Everything is incredibly well balanced. \nI mistakenly ordered the regular spicy chicken sandwich without cheese, lettuce and tomato one day and it wasn't nearly as good. \n\nI was surprised at how fresh the chicken was. I could see the moisture after taking a bite out of it, just as when I cook chicken at home fresh from the market.\n\nChick fil A must have the healthiest, tastiest and smartest kid's meals on the planet. The nuggets are fresh and delicious just like their sandwiches. For sides they have great options- applesauce or a fresh fruit cup. Their fruit cup was legit. It had mandarin oranges, blueberries, strawberries and apples and everything was so fresh. I also love their drink options-milk or organic juice. To top things off, they include a fun educational toy such as I spy booklets or pop out assemble yourself animals. Doesn't get any better than that. Finally a fast food place this mom approves of. \n\nDid I mention that they have the best milk shakes ever? I never order milk shakes but they turned me around all right. Seems like they use real ice cream and fresh milk. Their Oreo and vanilla milk shakes are so delicious and refreshing. They use fresh crunchy cookies and  actual vanilla flavor. The thickness and cool mouth feel is just right too. They top them off with whipped cream and a maraschino cherry. \n\nTry all of their sauces!!!! Sooooooo good. The combinations are endless. I like the Chick fil A sauce the most but also like combining the ranch with the zesty buffalo.\n\nI've been here more times than I can count because I'm truly addicted.

My husband and I arrived a few minutes early and were greeted by a sleek hostess immediately and even took our coats. We checked out the bar area downstairs and ordered an \"old fashioned\" from a beautiful bartender who also noticed us right away when we walked in and did not make us wave for her attention. The drink was expensive for us but good. The bar area is small but the decor is modern and yet warm and cozy. There were business people there for happy hour, romantic couples and even a few singles by themselves enjoying a light dinner by the bar and a book. Everyone looked comfortable. The kitchen is at the back of the room and you can see the chefs in there cooking up a storm. Bless them!\nOne of the bartenders found that I was there for RW and he took at least 5 minutes to go through the entire menu with me and gave me his opinions of his favorites. He recommended the following: Tuna Tostadas, Octopus, Lobster Pot Pie, and others for appetizers. For entrees, he noted how pleasantly surprised he was at the chicken, and also recommended the NY Strip (not a full fillet). I was interested in the seafood entrees and he approved my choice of the grouper.\n\nWhen our party was ready, we were led upstairs to the dining room. Similar decor but now you get to check out the details of the table setting. It is a small place but after settling into our seats I did not feel cramped at all. It's a great date place. The lighting again was low but warm. There were some interesting flower arrangements at the bar in the back. Our little appetizer/bread plates were really cute, it looked like a big coaster and it in was a print of a studio apt layout! The colors were soft gold with specks of red. Festive and romantic. The girls were giddy.\n\nThe service was great. Our waiter was not pushy but informational. I didnt ask for his recommendations though. I should've. \nRun down of the food we ordered:\nApps: Octopus, Lobster Pot Pie, Beet Salad, Regular Salad, Tuna Tostada, Potato Gnocchi. It seems that all were good. I heard the Beet Salad had a fishy taste in part of the sauce and we suspected anchovies but another taster could not find it.\nMy lobster pot pie had a buttery flaky crust topped with a CLAW! It was such a  cute presentation! The soup was just as indulgent and naughty! Creamy, lobster bisque like with root vegetables that were still crunchy and flavorful. My husband had the Tuna Tostada. It was a good combo of tortilla chip (salty), jalapeno, spicy sauce and raw tuna. There were 3 bites on the plate which was probably not enough for my husband but he shared the pot pie with me. The tuna tostada was good but not as spectacular as the pot pie. I had a taste of the octopus. Very refreshing! It had a tang to it and it was tender and not chewy. It paired well with the fennel. \nFor entree I got the \"Pan Seared Grouper with\nwhite sweet potatoes, roasted corn and truffle vinaigrette\" The sweet potatoes were pureed so that it could've been a polenta look alike on the dish. The corn and truffle was served on top of the sweet potatoes with a just right size piece of grouper. I loved the sweet potatoes. It was sweet & savory. The corn and truffle added the saltiness and interesting texture. The fish was good. Nothing too crazy. I felt like the star was the side dish. The presentation was lovely. I really felt like I was on Iron chef.\nMy husband's NY Strip was cook right and the purple potatoes were fun to eat. He said while it was good, he has had better steaks before. But men can never resist ordering red meats at places if offered.\nEveryone finished their entrees. One ordered the bass and one ordered salmon. Another ordered the NY Strip as well and he finished his first. The portions of the entrees were not obnoxiously big or too petite. It was just right for a 3 course meal. Dessert: I looked forward to this the most, but alas, the appetizer was my favorite course. That's because I didnt order the apple fritters!!!!!\nLuckily my friend ordered it, it came out looking like fried donut holes! I got a bite and was in love. Fluffy, with sugar, and gooey apple inside. Better than my apple pies out of the oven. My cranberry upside down cake was sort of rustic and dry. The goat cheese ice cream was not kidding! It really tasted like goat cheese. I had half the chocolate orange tart of his and the chocolate was creamy and the tart was ok. I think they wanted the chocolate to stand out more. Not bad. With a couple of drinks per person, our bill came out to about $50 per person. I thought it was a great price for the amount of food and lovely experience. I was really pleased that they didnt automatically add gratuity in there. The waiters had to run up from the kitchen downstairs to deliver our food.

Immediately, one caught my boyfriend's eye. \"I like that one.\" I came back the next day and took him out of the cage and he stretched his little head up and touched his nose to mine. I WAS IN LOVE! Within a few days, I took him home and now the four of us are one happy family.\n\nI love that their adoptions have a good turn-around. It warms my heart.

Came with some friends and got to try a pretty good variety of stuff.  For burgers we had the Walk of Fame, the Prime Degree and the Semester at Sea.  Walk of fame has an egg on top, Semester at Sea is a seared tuna burger. Prime degree is prime aged beef burger with bacon.  You really couldn't go wrong with any of them.  We started with the Shishito peppers for an app.  Wasn't a huge fan of them, but it was more that I just got tired of eating a plate of fried (blistered) peppers.  \n\nWe also had the beer cheese tots, cucumber-tomato salad and the pork belly mac and cheese.  Tots were good, but lets face it: they're tater tots.  The salad was amazing.  Its an asian flavored salad so it has the sweet vinegar taste.  I loved it!  The mac n cheese was delicious, but it was inconsistent.  We had 3 bowls of it and all 3 were very different. Like goldilocks and the 3 bears, one had WAY too much cheese, one had none and the 3rd was perfect.  If they all came out like the 3rd option, I'd say its a no brainer, but it just wasn't consistent.  I suppose its nice in the sense that it seemed like each bowl was made to order, rather than having a huge vat of it that they scoop it out of repeatedly.  \n\nThe service was phenomenal also.  \n\nOverall, it was awesome!

I got to celebrate my birthday at Red Pony this weekend and was so pleased. We were promptly seated at our reservation time, and I do recommend reservations. Our waitress, Jaclyn, explained the menu and daily specials. She was so helpful, thoughtful, and knowledgeable! I started with the Midnight Sun cocktail (Picker's Blood Orange vodka, St. Germain, passionfruit, lime, and champagne). I love St. Germain, so I knew I had to try this. This cocktail was so fresh, citrusy, and bright. It was like a vacation in a glass! My boyfriend had the Open Season, which was equally delicious. \n\nIt was quite difficult to choose between all of the first courses since they all sounded amazing, but we went with the nightly special, Korean BBQ sliders. We received two sliders in what appeared to be steamed buns with moist and flavorful Korean style pulled pork, a fresh slaw, and a house spicy pickle. These were BOMB! They seemed super popular, so I think they should be added to the menu! I've never had anything like this, so it was a very fun dish. \n\nAll of the entrees sounded amazing and unique....rabbit pot pie, crispy fried elk, almandine branzino...so many choices! Since I'm a sucker for risotto, I was sold on the meatballs, which are ground in house with beef tenderloin and elk, with garlic-parm risotto, rustic tomato sauce, and mushroom bacon. Mushroom bacon, what is that?! I have no idea how they make this, but it's phenomenal. I don't even like mushrooms, and I ate all of these. It seriously tastes just like bacon! This would be amazing for vegetarians. The meatballs were juicy and packed with flavor. I loved the perfectly executed risotto. I did wish there was a bit more texture, but overall it was an amazing comfort dish. My boyfriend went with the shrimp and grits, which they're apparently known for. Fun fact: you can add filet, scallops, whatever you like! I don't even like shrimp and grits, but this was AWESOME! I want to put their broth on everything. It was slightly spicy, acidic, and bright. The whole dish was concentrated with flavor. My boyfriend said it was the best shrimp he's ever had and perfectly cooked. I loved the garlic cheese grits! \n\nSince it was my birthday, I received a free dessert. It was hard to choose between all of the fabulous options, but I had to try the Chocolate Demise. Just the name alone is intriguing. The dessert was basically a chocolate lava cake with homemade vanilla bean ice cream. Mamma Mia, this dessert was like crack! I am a dessert snob, but I loved this dessert. It was so chocolatey and perfectly baked. The ice cream was equally delicious. I really enjoyed my birthday treat! \n\nWow I was so impressed with Red Pony! It seemed like everyone there was celebrating an event or visiting with friends from out of town, and that's for a reason! This is the place to impress! If you live downtown, drive to Franklin and check out this gem. The service is top notch with unique dishes, cocktails, and desserts. You will not leave hungry!

It was difficult to decide and when I did make a choice I thought wistfully of roads not taken.  Though many things tempted me, I went w/ the grilled cheese sandwich and tomato bisque.  Alan ordered the tri tip slider, a house made cheddar biscuit, scrambled egg, arugula, jalape\u00f1o jam, served w/ country hash.  He ordered coffee and I ordered Lady Earl Grey tea.\n\nThe tea was served in a French press-type device.  We had whole milk on the side for both coffee and tea.  My tea cup was tall, graceful white porcelain.  The contents of the press just filled it.  The tea was very tasty.  When our dishes arrived they looked beautiful.  My sandwich contained tea smoked tomato, pulled mozzarella, brie,\nparmesan rubbed bread, mint cashew pesto.  It was luscious and generous enough to share bites w/ Alan and still be too much for me to finish.  The tomato bisque was dark and subtly smokey, w/ occasional chunks of tomato.  It was my childhood comfort food grown up and elegant.  Alan gave me a taste of his biscuit and it was delicious.  He loved the dish, although he found the finely diced potatoes disappointingly bland, lacking onions, peppers or anything else to give them interest.

The beef reminded me of taco meat, but the kind that is seasoned extremely well.\n\nWatching him make the Chaat was like watching an artist. It was like Jackson Pollack at work with the piling on so much stuff. A threw a bunch of stuff down. Then he added 3-4 sauces. He threw more stuff down. Added more sauces.

That didn't interest me, so I said I would be back. \n\nI arrived today, and was excited to eat here, as I tried a small sample at a Yelp Elite Event (YEE). I ordered at the counter with a younger gentlemen and it wasn't busy to me, 1 guy waiting and 2 people already eating, and 1 couple behind me. \n\nI asked what to order as I was REALLY HUNGRY, and the gentlemen right off the bat said the Bison Burger ($16) without skipping a beat. I rarely eat bison and I was craving what I had at the YEE, and next he said Paleo Hunter Zoodle, either one was super filling. \n\nTotal for food was $3 for Cauliflower Fingers, $12 for the Paleo Hunter Zoodle. A full check plus small tip was just over $17, that's w/out a drink! I consider this a high price point for a lunch. \n\nI thoroughly checked over restaurant, something feels missing here, not sure, what best describes. My best interpretation is it's feel like an empty cafeteria, order here, fill your drink here, get condiments over there, and bus your table, basically no service, order, and just wait. I had a number on my table and the food comes out, a bit slow considering there was 1 order in front of me, and I think the dish I ordered much of it was pre-made like braised beef, vegetable noodles, etc. \n\nMy dish arrives and it looks naked, I only ate a sample at the YEE, so I didn't know why it felt naked, but I felt like there should be a sauce over it or on the side, as it looks very much NAKED, I was quite confused because my cauliflower (C) fingers had a salsa side. I tried the C fingers first, as it's my guess is it's the C pizza, cut into strips, to make the fingers. I had enough salsa for about half of them, and it was okay, kind of cool to be able to order a unique side, but wouldn't need to order it again, as the flavor was okay to below okay, not enough C for me (also no notations on nutrition on this dish nor other hand-helds???) \n\nI am looking at my main dish the Paleo Hunter, and again, it feels so naked, I start thinking about what sauces I can add to it, but nothing looks like a match, but I did notice a wasabi in the cooler when waiting to order, and thought if it's real wasabi that might give it a bit of flavor and heat, and at least add much much needed moisture to this dish that looks like it needed something to blanket. Please note, I did ask cashier, who said it was okay to grab the wasabi dixie cup from the cooler.  \n\nI added the sauce very carefully and then being a professional salad tosser (Western Village Steakhouse) from 1994, I tossed my dish expertly and thoroughly in case the wasabi was super hot, which I was HOPING it was! It was NOT! I started eating the dish, and the first I notice it was below lukewarm in temperature, it was just between cold and luke warm, I was quite confused. \n\nI spent only about 2-3 minutes eating the C fingers, so that couldn't be it, the wasabi from the cooler was about 1.5 oz Dixie cup, carefully poured to cover the dish, why was my dish almost cold, maybe that's how they do it here, it's a unique place, serving unique, maybe they don't want the nutrients to cook off??? I wasn't sure, but then again, I really didn't want to just eat it and assume, so I waited to talk to the cashier, who really just takes orders and gets food from the back, but all of the sudden it took over 5 minutes and a phone order, to get his attention. \n\nI said, should my food be almost cold? He said yeah maybe, because it didn't sit under the heat lamp that long. I was still puzzled so I said, how was it cooked? He said on the stove. I was was still puzzled, his answer was that yeah, if it goes from the stove to the plate to your table that happens. Okay, I decided to eat the food as it was, and as I did I realized, I was never eat here again, so it's really simple, just eat, leave, and a solid review, to let my fans know the biz (I want to save you $$, if you value it)! \n\nAgain love the concept of BFF, but based on today experience THIS PLACE IS NOT FOR ME! Last but not least, as I was relaying the story to co-workers, because you know the power of a bad experience, you usually share 10x and a good experience 1x, I remembered, looking at the menu, and then I remembered being at my YEE event, that this dish is suppose to have a Blanket, which today was Missing, and that is the Chimichurri Sauce! That was another aha moment of the terrible experience I had today. \n\nLast note the cashier told me that they had a big rush before me that's why the food didn't sit under the heat lamp long enough to warm up the food, I guess that big to go order before me really stressed the chef!

My friends both got the Mie Kepiting (homemade egg noodles with crab meat). The noodles were phenomenal; a delightful and unique combination of texture and flavor. The noodles and crab meat are in one bowl, and the broth is served on the side, so you can pour it in to suit your ideal ratio of noodles: broth. I got the Nasi Urap with what were described to me as \"stinky beans\" (I did not find them very stinky at all, which is a good thing). The beans came in a rich, spicy, coconutty sauce that I absolutely adored. The plate came with a nest of assorted crispy fried vegetables, which complimented the texture of the beans and rice perfectly. I was a little disappointed there were not more vegetarian items on the menu, considering the many vegan options available at other Indonesian restaurants in the area, but apparently they can make several dishes to order, so I would love to come back and try a vegetarian version of the noodles if they have it.\n\nI'm so glad I finally tried this place!

Often we didn't have the cash so we'd split plates. Nino (the owner) would see us doing this and would give us extra food because \"growing kids have got to eat!\".  \n\nDuring this time my mom had cancer so when she'd actually feel like eating I'd call in a pickup order for her. He'd tell me to stay home and take care of my mom and he'd have his kitchen help run down the street to my house to hand deliver it. \"Fresh food help you feel better fast 'eh?\"\n\nSeveral years later when one of the high school gang died suddenly my hubs and I stopped by Nino's after the funeral.

Everything is very very fresh.  Watching him make the bread and dough is pretty awesome.\n\nOf the cafeteria style dishes I love  the lasagna and the veal parmesan. \nAs for the other stuff they have..OMG the philly cheese steak. It's probably not a real proper philly cheese steak since we're not in philly but so so tasty. Nino makes it fresh on the grill and pairs it with bread he bakes.\nThe pizza! Nino's pizza will ruin you for all other pizza. He makes his own dough and sauce. I've watched my hubs put away a whole  pizza all by himself and they are NOT small just very very good.  Nino actually knows the difference between stromboli and a calzone. Dat stromboli yo.\n\nExtra parking on the side and rear. Does not take cards.\n\nMommy notes: Nino loves talking to kids.

After a day of training for a new job, my new co-workers and I ventured into the city with a free bottle of wine and free bottle of cider in hopes of finding a nice BYO to imbibe. We were told Kanella could be hit-or-miss, but we decided to give it a try. \n\nRight off the bat, everything was great. It had just opened so we had no problem getting a table sans-reservation, and the hostess gave us a table that was right by a window, albeit next to the kitchen, that gave us a nice place to people-watch. The decor itself is lovely. The banquets are lined with loose pillows, everything is done in light colors and the big windows really complete the whole comfy, relaxed vibe. Our server (I'm totally blanking on the name) was really nice, funny,  and efficient, despite him coming off as a bit spacey. \n\nNow, the best part is obviously the food. We shared 4 appetizers and 2 desserts for our meal which definitely left us super full. The dips of the day that we got to try were a garlic-potato, which was pleasantly chunky, a creamy yet somewhat savory lentil spread (my FAVORITE omg), and traditional baba ghanouj. The pita that it was served with was warm and obviously right off the grill. The dolmathes were also great and had an interesting spin in that it was served with raisins, giving it a sweet aspect. I wish it had come with 3 pieces, as opposed to two, but that's just a minor complain. We also had a pastry that had feta cheese and spinach, topped with honey (they even gave that honey thing that is used traditionally...the wooden one? You know? I have no idea what it's called), and it was divine. Our final appetizer was the grilled calamari, which I found delightful for being a bit overdone. Fortunately for us, the chef felt the same way and gave it to us on the house without us even making a comment on it. Finally, the deserts were AWESOME. We got a trio of ice cream which included mint, cardamom, and jasmine. The jasmine wasn't my deal, but the mint was AWESOME. It tasted like actual mint, as opposed to something you would buy out of a carton from Acme. The small pastry tasting I felt was slightly over-priced, but then again they managed to make semolina cake really good so I guess I can't really complain. \n\nWhile Kanella isn't the best Greek/Mediterranean food in the city, it's definitely up there.

The chicken on the other hand, had NO flavor. I ask my girlfriend how her food was, and I see this look of disappointment.

I always order my pizza extra crispy and as some places may tend to over cook my order, Precinct cooked mines to perfection!

The stew had the absolutely best flavor, reminiscent of Indian but very much a comfort food on a cold day. My hubby's sandwich was just wonderfully cooked, the meat had the consistency of melted butter. The apple butter really brought the flavor together. His came with so many shoestring fries - I don't normally love shoestring fries but these were very nice and crisp but soft in the middle. \n\nWe decided to do dessert, date cake with housemate frozen yogurt. It was good but not entirely my style. \n\nThe service was awesome - Kirsten really knew her stuff and she was extremely pleasant. She checked on us the right amount and was very knowledgable about the menu items. The only (not very) negative point I will say is the support staff who brought the dishes didn't explain them - like which cheeses were which. But Kirsten came right over to make sure we knew! \n\nOur bill was $93 with four drinks, cheeses, 2 entrees, and dessert - not bad! My hubby said he was happy to spend a $100 on that meal - which NEVER happens. The entrees were reasonable ($11-19) so don't worry about spending too much unless you indulge like we did. \n\nWe immediately began talking about when we would be back and who we wanted to come with us.

I think she noticed the shock in my face after how she spoke to me because she approached me afterward and was very helpful and chatty. Later, we went to buy some pajamas and the lady at the double sided counter ignored us and stood with her back facing us as we stood there waiting to make a purchase.

I did not say I would check you out on this side. You can go back to the other side\" in a very stern voice. I considered putting my items back and leaving the store if I hadn't wanted them so badly.

My husband had the Sbraga punch which was sweet and perfectly balanced.  I enjoyed the South Carolina Serenade which was strong and delicious! \n\nWe were then shown to our table where we found birthday cards for each of us signed by Chef Sbraga and were greeted quickly asking for our water preference and going over the set up of the menu. \n\nWe tried to order quite a few different options to share: \n\nTruffle Popovers: One of the most delicious bread services I have ever had.  Hot and delicious.  We each had two and probably would have had more, but were glad we didn't so we could enjoy the rest of the food fully. \n\nFirst Course\nFoie Gras Soup: Perfection.  There are no other words that I can use to describe the serious deliciousness of this dish.  It was rich, hearty and light at the same time, and so silky. I must love my husband because I didn't cut off his hand when he kept reaching in to steal more of my precious soup. \n\nPork Belly with chili oil: Delicious and surprisingly light for pork belly.  This was a perfectly balanced dish that would have been a standout anywhere else, but I definitely won the round with the soup.\n\nSecond Course\n\nGnocchi, Escargot, Tom Ka Gai: We both could not pass up on this so we ordered the same dish, and in now way did I feel cheated.  This was the essence of delicious food.  Cloud like gnocchi with delicious and perfectly cooked escargot in an amazing tom ka gai broth with a bit of kick which helped to cut through the richness. \n\nThird Course\n\nSpring Lamb: Delicious, though I didn't personally appreciate the raw shaved asparagus (personal preference, not a deterrent to the dish).  I enjoyed the dish, but it was not as memorable as the previous courses. \n\nWagyu Beef Supplement: Wonderfully unctuous beef cheeks.  Definitely worth the supplement charge and a must try. \n\nDessert\n\nWith so many interesting choices we asked our waiter for his opinion and he was quick to suggest the banana split and rice pudding. \n\nThey were both delicious and light after such an amazing meal.  We sat for a few minutes savoring all of the interesting flavor combinations and reminiscing on one of the best meals either of us has ever had.  \n\nThe services was fantastic and we later found out that the staff had been at the restaurant from 9 am due to the PIFA street fair.  You would never have known that they had been there for more than 12 hours by the end of our meal and still going strong.

I'm so glad we did -- overall, the meal was quite good. There were a few slip ups, but it was definitely worth it. \n\nAppetizers\nPotato and Herb Gnocchi -- This was absolutely delicious. The little salad that came with it was fantastic and added an excellent crunch to the dish. The broth was so good that I used the bread (also wonderful, by the way) to mop it all up. \n\nLobster and Shrimp -- The shrimp were, and I quote, \"amazing\". Cooked extremely well and the cocktail sauce was exceptional. My boyfriend enjoyed the contrast between the warm shrimp and cold lobster, and it was paired very well with the avocado. \n\nMain Courses\nBoth of us got the Butcher's Filet of Beef. It was good, especially the Bearnaise sauce, but both of our dishes had temperature issues. I prefer my meat extremely rare, nearly a Pittsburgh blue, and made sure to tell our waiter this. Jon prefers his a little more cooked, though still pink in the middle -- a balance, perhaps, between medium and medium rare. Both of our dishes were overcooked. The manager was extremely apologetic and immediately fired new dishes, but a restaurant of this caliber should not have issues cooking meat to order. Aside from that, the steak fries were awesome. Not too bland on the inside, a danger with a lot of steak fries, but rather deliciously spiced and aired nicely with the short rib gravy. \n\nDesserts\nWarm Vanilla Cake -- Jon ordered this, and I wish I'd had more of an opportunity to steal from him! Unfortunately (for me), he ate it at record speed. He does not typically enjoy desserts, but this was a clear exception. The bite I did have tasted like melted sugar cookies and was reminiscent of my childhood. We both adored it. \n\nPeruvain Chocolate Mousse -- This was my dessert. It was.. ok. Not memorable. I was shocked that it was a cold preparation because, honestly, it was more like chocolate ice cream. I wouldn't order it again, especially when that warm vanilla cake is available.\n\nWine\nWe got a bottle of the Arbios Cabernet, which was fantastic. On the pricey side, but it was well balanced and paired nicely with everything. Not too dry, sometimes a downfall of Cabernet, but still had the characteristic boldness we like so much. \n\nOverall\nReally great experience.

Every restaurant he recommend was great, and every place he recommended we should go see was worth it. If you have questions about the city, definitely go say hi to Milton and he will point you in the right direction, plus he is always so full of life!

I felt the same way. I would not have gone if another wedding guest did not suggest it. Ironically, I definitely recommend it. The tour guides are stationed at the gate. However, they need to take you across the street to collect the $20 fee because of a city ordinance. The burial process is unique in New Orleans because the city is below sea level. As a result, the tombs are buried above ground and then sink. Since it gets extremely hot in New Orleans, the bodies will basically be cremated naturally. The tour guides give a thorough explanation of the burial process.\n\nThe most famous of the cemeteries is St. Louis Cemetery No. 1. There are a lot of famous New Orleans residents buried in it. The tour guides do an excellent job pointing out the famous and historic figures buried there. Some of the most noteworthy are Homer Plessy who was the plaintiff in the landmark civil rights case Plessy v Ferguson and voodoo priestess Marie Laveau. There is an interesting urban legend about the tomb of Marie Laveau. If someone wants Laveau to grant them a wish, he should draw an X on the tomb, turn around three times, knock on the tomb, and yell out his wish. If it is granted, he needs to return to the tomb, circle his X, and leave Laveau an offering. Our tour guide gave us a funny warning not to do so. Since there has been issues with cemetery desecration; she noted that if you draw an X on the tomb, your wish is a $10,000 fine and jail time. She also did a great job explaining the history of the city. I love learning about history so the tour was very enjoyable.\n\nYou can reach St. Louis Cemetery No. 1 by taking a cable car or walking down Canal Street before turning north on Basin St. Definitely stay on those two main roads though. The side streets can be sketchy. We wandered down a side street going to the cemetery. We kept quiet and remained at a steady pace before we got back on Basin St.\n\nIf you are visiting New Orleans and looking for recommendations, feel free to message me through Yelp and I can share my itinerary, which includes my Yelp reviews.

Our waiter forgot three of the drinks and to put the wing order in. He apologized profusely and comped the wings. He did everything he was supposed to so I'm not totally faulting him but you know, it was a hiccup. The pizza was good, my manbot says great, and the wings were just fine as well. I had a vanilla donkey (I think that was the name) to drink and it was fantastic. We also tried the weird shot that Chicagoans adore? and I will say, \"no, never, it just sat in my throat and I will never drink it again.\" I don't regret trying it though. I love regional drinks.\n\nOverall all this is what Germantown has been missing for quite some time. It's a place where you can come drink, or you can come eat. It's family friendly and sports friendly. The TV's are huge and viewable from anywhere. The room is clean, open, and well-lit. This also causes it to be loud. So be prepared.

Good Pie is a comfy little shotgun pizzeria in mid-town that pretty much everybody has tried by now and from what I've heard, mostly liked.  I finally got around to stopping in for lunch and tried their lunch special, one of four pizza's with salad for about $12 ($1 less for meatless varieties).  This includes a salad, which is kind of awkwardly put on the pizza pan beside the pizza (yes, some spilled off onto the table, so a little less for me - no 3 second rule for this guy).   I had the sausage pizza and a chopped salad, both were excellent.  The pizza is really plenty for two, in fact I only ate half of the pizza. \n\nThe pizza had some charring, which is standard for neopolitan style, so I understand (not something a St. Louisan would be expected to know).  This is all good for me, but I know a couple other people in my family who would balk at the touch of black.  Their loss, I say, I also say it's why it took me so long to get here.\n\nThe ambiance here is very comfy pizzeria, nothing fancy.  They have an interesting list of craft beers on draught, which is a huge bonus, especially with pizza.  I had something called Left Hand Milk Stout and it was excellent.   So lunch was around $24, including tip - a little high, but again I brought home enough for another lunch.  \n\nI saw somewhere they are moving over to Delmar somewhere.

That was all I wanted - some delicious korean ribs and some kimchi. We went into Crystal BBQ with fairly low expectations and came out happy.\n\nWe didn't even look at the menu - we ended up having the all you can eat barbeque dinner, which was basically just every meat they could possibly offer, cooked right in front of you. The restaurant was dead, so we had one server all to ourselves (mostly) all night to help facilitate the cooking process, as cooking on the crystal bbq was tricky (as was figuring out which meats were which, and which were cooked or not!). The menu was huge, the waitress was very friendly and just said she would bring out a little of everything and we could try what we wanted before we ordered more. We barely made it through our \"try\" of everything before we were bursting at the seams. Tons of korean beef, beef ribs, pork, bacon, marinated chicken, shrimp, you name it, we had it. And it was actually REALLY good.\n\nAlong the piles of meats, they also served up korean dishes like kimchi, potatos, salads, veggies and steamed rice. The cost was very good, I think it ended up being something like $18 a person, including soft drinks. \n\nThe restaurant is located in a rather shifty area of downtown, just east of the court houses and slightly north of Jasper. It's fairly nice inside and the staff were very accommodating and friendly. I can't speak for the rest of the menu, but all of the meats we had in our dinner were seasoned just right and were super delicious. If you are looking to try out a variety of korean barbeque, I definitely recommend Crystal.\n\nONE RECOMMENDATION I HAVE: When this place gets busy and all the tables are cooking meats, the whole place can get very warm/greasy very fast. I don't recommend making this your go-to date place or dropping in for a meal before going anywhere important, because you walk out completely drenched in the smell of the restaurant. Just a tip.

For anyone that knows San Diego, this place was more hood than National City, but this is the only Filipino joint in Indy, so I gotta go where the food is.\n\nWe got there and noticed the \"Eduardo's\" sign just beneath the awning that said \"Charlie Biggs.\"  If we hadn't known better, we would have thought this was some cheap KFC knock off (yes, a \"cheap\" KFC knock off) as the  menu had mostly fried chicken combos and sides.  Heck even the heating window was mostly fried chicken.\n\nAs we looked over the menu a bit more carefully, we saw familiar items.  They had 3 special combos that had no names, just numbers.  One combo was for menudo, a second for \"shish kebob\" aka Filipino bbq, and the third was for lumpia.  I gotta be honest, I was a bit disappointed in the selection as they only had turon and adobo as their other standing dishes.  To be honest I was expecting more of a turo-turo joint, but we were there, and we were going to make the most of it.\n\nI ended up getting the bbq, the wife got the menudo, and we split a thing of lumpia.  As the lady behind the counter started scooping the rice, she looked over at us and asked \"one scoop, or two.\"  Bonus points for her, as I thought I was going to be disappointed and have to ask for more rice.\n\nWas this the best Filipino food I've ever had?  By no means.  Did it satisfy my craving for Filipino.  Certainly.  The people were super friendly too.  They even gave us some free casava cake while we waited for our turon to cook.  I think it helped that we established ourselves as Filipinos.\n\nOverall- if you want a true taste of Filipino food, order from their catering menu.  Their standard menu of adobo, menudo, and bbq is ok, but if you know Filipino cuisine and want some palabok, kare kare or sinigang, ordering is the only way to go.

I believe one of them was the titular Roselena.\n\nAfter another FIVE minutes I asked someone if they could check up on my order to see what was going on. He disappeared and came back to say it would be \"2 minutes.\" The perhaps-she-was-Roselena woman said that the delay was probably because of a change in shifts.\n\nFive minutes later, after a total of 25 minutes of waiting (which was easy to clock because a TV showing an episode of \"King of Queens\" went through an entire episode while I was there,) I left.

I lived right around the corner, and this was very disappointing to me. I came here often. Sometimes to get stamps, sometimes just to have them weigh my parcel so I did not accidentally put to much postage on it. All things considered, I was happy this place was so close, but always a bit annoyed when I had to come here.\n\nIn the age of Fedex and UPS, lots of people criticize USPS. Here is something that I love about them: the one-rate boxes. They have boxes that you can cram as much stuff as possible into and it is always the same rate.\n\nHere is the problem with USPS. Fedex and UPS are much more conveniently located and spread throughout cities. I was lucky to have USPS so close, but not that lucky. Because this is the main branch, it would ALWAYS be packed. Most recently I was here bright and early at 8am. There was only one employee working and I had about 4 people in front of me. I am thankful the employee was cheerful and SO FAST. She really did a good job. I only waited about 10 minutes. By the time I left, the line behind me was twice as long. It will probably get worse as the day goes on, but more employees will join her at the counter. \n\nI recall that since I was a little kid, I have never been to a Post Office that did not have a huge line. That is why I used to despise going there when I was little. I still feel that same angst as I walk through to automatic doors. \n\nMichael S. is right to point out that they sure do have a TON of P.O. Boxes. And I never recall being uncomfortably warm while waiting in the huge lines, so he must also be right about the air conditioning. \n\nOverall, I like the employees at this Post Office. They are friendly and really kick butt doing their job while keeping customers happy. I also truly hope they decided (or decide) not to close down this branch. While I do not live as close as I used to, I can only imagine that the crowds at other Post Offices will only get 100 times worse if this branch is closed. Sometime less is more, but I guarantee that saying will not hold true for the number of Post Offices that the government has in any given region.

The staff responded to my emails within an hour of sending them and answered all of my questions each time. The company is also one of the few that are open for tours on Christmas Day. However, despite the \"local flavor\" of this group, be prepared for much of the same touristy feel complete with crying kids and exasperated parents. Tour groups are always kind of a crap shoot, I guess, and Cajun Encounters is no exception. \n\nI enjoyed the Swamp Tour a lot. Our guide had the perfect mix of wry humor, interesting facts and amusing stories. Furthermore, he was clearly passionate about what he did and loved his city, so he didn't sound like he was reciting a rehearsed script. The tour itself takes you through some beautiful passages within Honey Island Swamp. Those silver, hanging Spanish moss curtains you see in pictures? They're real. In person, they are so utterly beautiful that I would actually recommend you tour the swamps in the winter than in warmer seasons. You may not see as much wildlife (although we still managed to see (and handle) a baby alligator, 2 snakes, 4 turtles, 1 magnificent blue heron, a beaver-like creature, and a mama wild boar with her 2 piglets who swam out to our boat for 20 mins feasting on the marshmallows our guide threw), but there is no foliage to mar the beauty of all that silver.\n\nThe Plantation Tour was much less impressive. Not so much for the plantations or the guides, but rather that it was very poorly planned. We were given far too much time at Laura Plantation (about 3 hours) and far too little time at Oak Alley (about 1 hour total from disembarking to re-boarding). Personally, I was completely unimpressed with our guide at Laura (who for some reason pronounces \"archives\" with a hard \"ch\" like the herb), and do not understand why people rave about the tour here. I was ready to leave halfway through. Oak Alley on the other hand is just as majestic and beautiful in person as it is in all the postcards, and the tour guides are far more captivating.

It was completely EMPTY. We spotted one other couple there. That's it. Maybe that should have been the first sign?\n\nOur waiter was terrible. He seated us, handed us menus and grabbed us some water, and then all but disappeared for the next 20 minutes. What was he DOING? Like I said before, the restaurant wasn't super busy. \n\nBut that's not why he was terrible. No, he was terrible because he did the one thing that bad waiters always do: they turn into douchebags when you ask them for suggestions.\n\nLet me explain. The burger bar has tons of combinations that you can use to put together your own burger. You choose your bun, the burger itself, your cheeses, toppings, etc. Of course, they also have specialty burgers where everything is chosen for you. But who wants to do that when you can play chef for a night and make your own burger?\n\nOkay, so here comes the waiter douchebag part. We asked for some suggestions on what combinations are popular among other guests, and the waiter POINTS TO THE MENU and tells us that the pre-selected options are pretty good. Gee, thanks, hun...I know how to READ. Gah! Maybe I'm weird, but that just burned me up. \n\nBut anyway, the food. We ordered the trio of fries as an appetizer: zucchini fries, onion rings, and pickle fries. \n\nFor my entree, I made my own burger using a ciabatta bun, buffalo burger, pepperjack cheese, avocado, and jalapeno bacon. I asked for my burger to be cooked medium. \n\nWell, guess what? Our appetizer came out at the same time as our entree. Awesome. Don't you just love when that happens? Poor timing, folks. Poor timing. \n\nThe app was pretty terrible to boot. How can you go wrong with deep fried goodness? Well, let me tell you: I bit into the deep fried pickle, and the whole pickle slid out in the first bite, leaving me with a sad empty breading shell. Ew. Same thing happened with the zucchini fries. And the onion rings. I guess this was God's way of telling me not to eat things that are deep fried? It worked. I stopped after a bite of each. \n\nMy burger was also lame and sad.

Like I said, I expected it to be soaked in honey, but it was just the right amount and none of it stuck to my teeth. The fillo pastry was airy and the filling was the perfect amount and not too strong. The sausages were so moist and aromatic. I'm also not a big fan of beets, but it was done well. I didn't feel like I wanted to spit it out.\n\nI also got to taste the Papia (duck leg) - very juicy and tender too with a crunchy skin. Arni (lamb) - medium actually means med rare, which was perfectly done to me. It wasn't gamey. Katsaki (braised goat) - very soft.

I will most likely probably never order Mexican food from here, since it's along the same lines of Cantina where you're overpaying for non-authentic and bland food.  However, I'm kicking myself for not getting the unlimited chips and salsa since I hear good things.  We opted to start with the grilled Mexican corn, which was very, very tasty with a delicious crema and scallions on top, but the parmesan cheese wasn't really melted on there and looked unappetizing on the plate (read before re: sloppy presentation).  The limes on the plate were browning, which is always a turn off, but whatever.\n\nWe ordered a pitcher of classic mango margarita on the rocks. I was excited because one thing Cantina does have going for it is the margaritas, so I assumed this place would taste like that- where the mango is infused in the flavor.  Not one bit.  It was a decent margarita, don't get me wrong, but it just tasted like the basic lime flavor.  The bottom was more yellow, so we were hoping that by the time we got there, it would taste more like mango, which it didn't.  What it did have were hundreds of tiny specks of mango chunks, just small enough to not pick out of the drink and irritating enough to make me wonder why they didn't use a strainer to get the bits out before they served it.  Luckily, it was damn strong and rendered roughly 3 glasses for each of us, so totally worth it (especially at half price for happy hour).  Just stick to the classic flavors and you'll be set.  \n\nFYI: the glasses they served us with salt were only like a quarter covered in salt, rather than brimming with it.  The limes on our glasses were also browning.\n\nFor entrees, I ordered the Texas cheesesteak off the regular menu and the BF ordered a Texas cheeseburger with bacon, onion rings & BBQ sauce off the discounted happy hour food menu.  Both were very tasty and filling and served with seasoned fries that sort of tasted like BBQ chip seasoning.  My cheesesteak was giant with pretty tender ribeye and served on a really fresh roll and smothered in a delicious cheese sauce, fried onions, and deep fried jalapenos for a kick.  The smoked ketchup on the side was VERY smoky, but grew on me throughout the meal and paired really nicely with the sandwich.  The burger was also very good and served on a nice big bun, but my BF said it really didn't need the onion rings, since they turned to mush under the weight of everything.\n\nBONUS: I didn't even realize until after the fact you could order any of the sandwiches in a toasted wrap form, which is always a good option.\n\nThe meal before tip was under $50 after all was said and done and I had a buzz, so I'd say it's definitely worth the trip during happy hour.\n\nOverall, I would still love to come back here for those bangin' happy hour specials alone, as well as try the infamous Chronic sandwich and MAYBE fajitas or quesadillas if I'm feeling adventurous.  \n\nPRO TIP: If you love dogs, come here to dog-watch.

Great place to start.\n\nFood: Started with the SHISHITO PEPPERS, def glad I did.  These are perfectly charred.  Cooked well, so that they are still a little crisp and not soggy.  Lightly salted.  Greatest part, they give a little pile of sea salt on the side, so you can season to your liking!!  Be careful with these.  Some of the peppers have a super spicy kick.\n  \nBUFFALO CAULIFLOWER was another starter.  This app was a bit too sour for me.  The tanginess was pretty potent that I could not focus on any other flavors.  Also, the exterior of the cauliflower was not that crispy.  More on the soggier side.  Not a fan.  Pass on this.\n  \nTURKEY BLT was a good choice.  The pretzel bread was nice and chewy.  Lovely choice of bread for this sammy.  Wonderfully smoked turkey with crispy bacon.  Comes together beautifully with the smooth gruyere cheese, and the creamy avocado aioli.  Great textures and tastes that really comes together in this sammy.  I got it with the Tuscan tavern fries.  Nice and crunchy fries.  Def try.\n\nSMORES on the tabletop.  Even comes with a small campfire.  Classic fix'ns for smores: graham crackers, marshmellows, and chocolate bar.  In addition, some strawberries and reese's peanut butter cups.  Was quite the indoor smores experience.\n\nService: Drinks were full, food got to the table fresh and hot, server was attentive, and table was cleared away promptly.  All together, I think it was a good experience.\n\nAmbiance: Very casual.  Rustic and slightly romantic.  Nice for a girls gathering, as well as date night. \n  \nDranks: Great selection of beers, wines, and specialty cocktails.  A little something for everyone.  I had wine that night, but def would like to go back and try one of their cocktails.  \n \nOverall: A place that I would like to visit again.  Food was good.  Drinks were good.

There is a small parking lot for customers and some free street parking across the street on Cornell.\n\nInside, the pub is quite dark.  On the north end of the pub is where you can see the brewing tanks behind glass next to the bar.  I grabbed one of the smaller tables in that section and ordered a flight of their in house brews.  The flights are about 5 oz each and were only $1.50 each.  I opted for four:  The Cerveza de Sol (a Mexican style lager 5% 10 IBU); the Nice Weiss (Hefeweizen 5.25% 14 IBU) with a mild banana/clove taste; To Helles With It (German style lager 5% 17 IBU); and I Got Rye on It (a malt liquor 9% 28 IBU).  I enjoyed each of the samples and recommend trying the flights to get a sense of what you might like best.\n\nI was drawn in by the Indy Burger Week promotion, so I went with the tasty Cheese Crock Bacon Burger with a side of brewpub \"chips\" and cole slaw.  The burger can be ordered to \"doneness\" and since I always order my burgers with a nice char, I was really pleased how great the kitchen did the grilling.  They then dunk the burger in cheese and serve it on a thick pretzel bun with bacon, lettuce, tomato, and pickle.  I have to admit that this was one huge stack of sandwich!  I ended up squishing the bun down to fit the sandwich in my mouth.  The taste was really good.  The cheese doesn't go on in a thick sheet like when a processed cheese is placed on top.  Instead, the heat of the burger melts the cheese so that you can see the cheese down in the crooks and crannies of the burger, but see mostly burger on the top.  Still, there was plenty of cheese flavor.\n\nThe cole slaw had a bit of a pungent taste.  I couldn't tell if it was the vinegar, but it may have had a touch of horseradish inside..not the heat, just something in the taste made me think of it.  It worked really well with bites of burger, but a little stronger than expected when eaten alone.\n\nThe brewpub \"chips\" are the English style thick sliced potatoes, not the crispy type we normally think of here.  I think there may have been a little bit of seasoning on them for additional flavor, but I didn't notice it throughout the batch.  \n\nThis service was attentive and helpful.  Although my waitress had customers in other sections of the pub, I never waited more than five minutes once I finished a glass or my meal to have them cleared.  Checkout was fairly quick too.\n\nAs Indiana's oldest brewery, they have a number of quality ales to select from their own tanks.

Not a bad dish, just really nothing special. \n\nTruffled Egg Toast\nI love truffles. It seemed like this piece of buttered Texas Toast with a truffle cheese. Was it real truffles. VERY unlikely. It tasted like it had some truffle aroma in there. But it wasn't the nasty stuff. This dish was really enjoyable. Really because truffle flavor is just so darned good. This was a nicely balanced dish. I really enjoyed it. \n\nFigs and Prosciutto\nThis was the standout. Truly an incredible blend of flavors: figs, honey, and prosciutto.

The setting was small and intimate with only 30 tables. Our table was nicely set and reserved for 6.  The 3 courses were impeccably paired with wine by one of my attendings (have to LOVE the BYOB option). We were started off with warm, fresh popovers.  It was hard to resist these  tasty, glutinous, soft buttery rolls and I could not help but eat more than one.  I loved my first course- the Bloody Beet Steak. The delicious tart \"meaty\" beets were perfectly marinated with beet drippings and creamy velvety yogurt. My second course was shared with someone and I got to taste the sturgeon as well as the creamy lamb ragu paired with Hand Made Fettuccine.  Who doesn't love fresh pasta?  My main course was the Great Lakes Walleye fish and it was cooked perfectly.  I thoroughly enjoyed the seared crispy skin on top.  The creamed lettuce, peekytoe crab, asparagus whole grain mustard really complemented well with the delicate, flaky fish and not overpowering the subtle flavors.  This restaurant constantly changes their menu and I can see that they make a point to use farm fresh/ in-season ingredients like fiddleheads and ramps.  The dessert provided a great sweet ending and we all really enjoyed the ricotta doughnuts!   The service was superb.

So were were both miserable when we came in (bless you air conditioning). The restaurant is split up into cold items and lunch foods and warmer meals and coffee on the other side. Of course for brunch the coffee/hot food was the busiest and had a long line (though nothing compared to Biscuit Love). It took us around 10 minutes to get through the line and order our food, which I consider pretty amazing for peak brunch time on Sunday without a reservation. I ordered the avocado toast with one fried egg and my BF had the fried chicken biscuit with gravy. We each had coffee and lucky for me they had just started serving frose (rose with watermelon puree and vermouth). It was delicious, refreshing, and not sweet at all which is how I like my rose. The coffee was strong and delicious and came out pretty quickly after ordering it. The drinks were really on point. Our entrees came out on paper plates and we had to use plastic silverware. This was really confusing. The ambiance is sleek and upscale, so this was quite a bit of a turn off and left something to be desired. It's also difficult to eat a messy fried chicken biscuit with gravy using a flimsy knife and fork. Also my avocado toast looked slopped on the plate. I thought that was again weird for a nice establishment. Especially when the total cost with tip was $32.00 (I did get alcohol but still). \nHowever, what the food lacked in visual appeal more than made up for in taste. Both dishes were very good.

Second, they have the largest selection of specialty Oysters I have ever seen. Cheeseburger Oysters? Philly Oysters? Dessert Oysters!?!? I had all intentions of ordering the Apple Crisp Oyster - I just couldn't bring myself to do so once I got there. I chickened  out.\n\nI started off with a dozen of the classic, lightly steamed. They were very good. I then went for a traditional specialty oyster. This girl couldn't cheeseburger oysters. I ordered the Oysters Rock - also known as Oysters Rockefeller. Half a dozen only sent me back $7. Amazing!\n\nWe also trieed Chicago Baked Oysters, which were Garlic Butter & Parmesan. Sounded greatly like Acme Oyster House charbroiled oysters. Half a dozen for only $6. \n\nThe oysters were amazing, the prices were very good. If you were looking for something other than oysters, they have a pretty decent menu with options for everyone. It was definitely worth the trip to that side of Tampa. I still can't get over the Apple Crisp Oysters and would love to know if anyone is daring enough to try them.", "date": "2012-07-19 02:36:12"}, {"_key": "116100", "_id": "reviews/116100", "_rev": "_fNyp7Yy--M", "review_id": "8toYnGxd33jthEEVf7fS-g", "user_id": "7vmV8eFjKO3fKTlqrDsrjA", "business_id": "2er_V-oAd7IbQ5YTY56r7A", "stars": 4, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Their honey fried chicken was to die for!!

Plus, we got lots of help and guidance from the staff. \n\nHalf of our group was in town from Europe and Asia, so I wanted something that was fun, interactive, and uniquely American.  This fit the bill perfectly, and the space was perfect for our needs.  I was a little nervous driving into the strip mall parking lot, because the space looks a little nondescript from the outside.

From now on, I will question anyone who says \"Blah blah blah has my favorite burger...\" with \"Have you been to Village Whiskey?\" Because it's really that good. It's an all around phenomenal burger.\n\nDan and I had lunch here last week. It was a beautiful day, and Village Whiskey has some great outdoor seating.  They run tables along the wall like most places, but they have a bit more room than normal and an awning to provide shade.  We didn't step inside, but I'm sure it has a nice atmosphere.  The service during our whole meal was good; I'd be surprised to find anything less at a place like this.  \n\nTrue to its name, this spot has an incredible selection of whiskey.  We didn't partake, but I'd like to at some point.  The beer list is decent, even though everything is one or two more dollars than it should be.  There are about six draft beers that rotate, along with a decent bottle list, including about ten large format bottles.  We split a 25oz bottle of red and white for $25, which isn't bad at all.  This Dogfish Head beer is a a whit aged in pinot noir barrels.  I really love it.\n\nWe both went with the burger.  There's an option to get a $24 burger with blue cheese, bacon and foie gras on top.  It sounds like overkill to me.  I went with the regular burger with blue cheese.  When it came out, I didn't like the looks of the burger.  Large chunks of blue cheese topped a patty that looked larger than a hockey puck.  I thought this huge patty was ridiculously oversized.  It only took one bite to change my mind.  To start, the burger was more tender and juicy than any other I've had.  Second, the ground beef was so lightly packed that it was almost barely formed.  This gave the meat great texture, and was why the patty seemed so large.  The burger was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The blue cheese was a fantastic addition; it's quickly becoming my favorite cheese for burgers. \n\nThe burgers don't come with any sides, so we put in an order of fries.  We decided to splurge and order the duck fat fries topped with Sly Fox cheddar sauce and braised short ribs.  It's a bit of overkill.  It's also delicious.  Every part of this side dish is well executed.  If you can forget that it's well over 1000 calories, you'll be able to enjoy these beefy cheddar fries.  To be honest, I think I'll order the plain fries next time.\n\nBottom Line: The burger here is amazing, and it's reason enough to visit.  It's a bit pricey, but that's what you should expect for the area.  If you eat meat, I highly recommend coming here.  A little more effort in the beer list is desired, but other than that Village Whiskey doesn't disappoint.

After going out for PYT at the piazza and loving it, we decided it's a bit far for us to go there every week, so after looking around Yelp, we settled for 500 Degrees. It earns point from me just by naming it a numeric symbol.\n\nOutside the door, there's a burger of the week sign with some interesting concept burgers.  Upon entering and after reading the menu, I asked for a \"Heat Lover Combo\" and I repeated myself 3 times because apparently the server has never heard of the Heat Lover before and I have to point at the sign right next to the cash register and tell him I want that burger in a combo. In which he told me that the special burgers don't come available in a combo. Huh? Is it so difficult to put that in a combo deal like all the regular burgers they have here? (After reviewing their facebook page, apparently a lot of burgers of the week comes in a combo pack, so I don't know what the problem was)\n\nAnyway, after ordering that and a 500 burger combo with mushrooms, we sat at the well lit dining room and started analyzing. The burgers were quite superb, perfect sized, good soft buns with a juicy, soft, meaty patty that goes perfectly with the cheddar. The special sauce in the 500 burger is tasty and the bacon added some crispiness. The grill has slightly charred the outside and give it a smokiness that's ever so alluring. The special sauce and a lite dijon mustard is also served at the table that undoubtedly enhance the flavor of any burgers.\n\nThe Heat Lover burger has a lovely pickled jalapeno peppers on top that tickle the taste buds but not enough to give you an intense heat. The spicy fries and the truffle fries are also a bit weak in flavor, so was my chocolate shake. I wonder if the fries can benefit with just a tad more salt and pepper or the flavoring it promised. The fries are also a bit on the soft side. \n\nThe burger outweighs the bad, with a well lit place and an affordable menu, it's still very much worth coming back again.

The decor is absolutely beautiful. It felt warm and inviting but also very modern and fun. We started our meal with the crab cake and the corn dogs. I was a bit surprised to see a crab cake appetizer with only one crab cake. I think it would have been better to have two smaller crab cakes to make it easier to share (it is an appetizer). However, the flavor of it was very good. The corn dogs were also good, but the portion size felt very off to me. It was served with five corn dogs, but they were almost the size of my palm. This required us to use a knife to eat them, so then the breading was falling off, making it somewhat strange to eat. I would have liked to see this served differently. For our meals, we both ordered the jambalaya. I enjoyed the sausage and tiny shrimp in the dish and felt it added some much needed texture. I found myself seeking those bites out and stopping when they were gone. I was surprised at the dish it was served in. It essentially came out in a boat instead of a bowl, which I felt was an odd choice. Our server, while a nice person, was not very helpful in terms of recommending items on the menu. For a new restaurant, I wanted to hear the house recommendations or customer favorites so far. They also went missing for about thirty minutes after we were served our main dishes and we had to flag someone down to get our check. I really wanted to love this restaurant but it fell a little short of my expectations. The food was good, but not as good as I was expecting for the price, and service was inconsistent.

It has a lot of positive qualities, but there's also plenty of negatives. I've been here twice with the beautiful wife, so it's time to write a review. Rather than writing some gripping story, let's just hit some points. I'll also say that this could have just as easily been a 4 star review. But for the price, I'll keep it at three.\n\nThe Good:\n1) We've only been here in the evening for dinner, but service has been really good. We've also sat upstairs both times (more about that later). We also appreciated a visit by Gene Bailey (manager and brother of owner Dave), where we were able to give some feedback\n\n2) The two burgers that I've had (PB&J (pesto, goat cheese, tomato jam on a bison patty) and the Ozark (Ozark mushrooms, caramelized onions, and goat cheese) have both been great. Lots of lots with a good amount of toppings\n\n3) The flavor of the shakes -- we've had the Irish Coffee (delicious) and the Sweet Sweet Bacon (bourbon, candied bacon, salted\ncaramel ice cream). If you're a fan of Pulp Fiction, you'll remember Vincent commenting about the $5 milkshake. Do they put bourbon in this one? Oh yes they do. And is this a good milkshake? Nay, it's a a pretty fucking good milkshake\n\n4) The beer list -- they're keeping it mostly local and there are some excellent beers on tap\n\n5) The house made pickles and catsup, the fries, the smoked onion rings -- I enjoyed all of them\n\nThe \"not so good\":\n\n1) Price -- especially if you enjoy alcoholic beverages, you can rack up some stupid bills. The two times we've been there we've ended up with hefty bills (with tip, over $90 each time). I guess if you're a \"let's split a burger, an order fries, and have one soda each\" type of couple, you'll be able to walk out of there for $20. But, you're not much fun either. So live with that.\n\n2) The consistency of the shakes -- I'd put the Irish Coffee shake up there with anything that Kota or the Fountain offers, but at Bailey's Range, they're just too thin. I know that Kota bought some uber shake machine, and while I'm not buying one for them, at some point, they should upgrade\n\n3) The cheese curds -- I like cheese curds, but admittedly, I expected fried cheese curds. Instead, these are fresh. So Wisconsinites, you've been warned.\n\n4) The rest of the alcoholic drink menu -- just haven't been a fan of anything the beautiful wife has ordered. For instance, The Bermuda is pretty much a Dark & Stormy with passion fruit nectar. But as presented, all you tasted was the passion fruit. Other drinks tasted more fruity/light, but then again, when you've gotten used to drinking mixtologist concoctions all the time, it's probably my palate.\n\n5) The Carolina burger (topped with smoked pork shoulder,\nhouse bbq sauce, sweet & spicy slaw) was so drenched in BBQ sauce that you couldn't taste anything else. The sauce was wonderful, but if you really want this burger, get the sauce on the side so you can moderate the amount you put on.\n\nI really want to love Bailey's Range -- but that doesn't mean that I hate it. More that I was hoping it would be a place where we'd go on a Tuesday night when we don't feel like cooking. Instead, it feels more like a \"we'll come here once a month.\"", "date": "2011-10-31 00:42:39"}, {"_key": "119314", "_id": "reviews/119314", "_rev": "_fNyp7eG--H", "review_id": "BJP_EfVGWn43_gPDz1-Qbg", "user_id": "dV6DEH43Cw5Puv8VGh_uQA", "business_id": "tuDKqV-4zBZDaAsCoLeGxg", "stars": 4, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "This is a great hotel!

We also ordered the singapore mei fun, which I believe Szechuan House makes the best I've ever tasted. There is real curry powder in it and you can taste it. Another thing we ordered was the duck with black bean curd in spicy sauce. The sauce was spicy and salty and oily and delicious.

I'd never been that I can remember (while my dad claims our family has before). We were there for breakfast on a weekday morning. There were a decent amount of people in there - mostly elderly folk enjoying each other's company. \n\nI really liked the industrial vibe of the place. Apparently this look is new. The reno is working for them if you ask me! Great look! \n\nAs someone who loves breakfast, but is both gluten and dairy intolerant,  I sometimes struggle to find good options. Dale's had plenty that I could try with a little adjustment - like ordering with no cheese. I tried an egg scramble - hash browns with mushrooms, tomatoes, and sausage, topped with an egg. It was supposed to have cheese as well, but I ordered it without.\n\nIt took a little longer than we would have liked for our food to come out. I was pretty hungry, so that could have been more of a 'time is passing less slowly than it feels' thing. That's fine! The food came out, and I immediately see cheese melted on my eggs. I made sure to send it back right away, while my mom began to eat her meal. They had to completely remake the order, so it took a bit to get it back the correct way. (I did enjoy the \"NO CHEESE!!!\" I heard someone yell in exasperation from the kitchen at my seat by the front door.)\n\nWhen I did get the corrected order, it didn't look as good as that first plate I received. There seemed to be less eggs on it. I think they were just rushing to get it out to me and it showed a bit in the presentation. Not really a huge deal. I care more about the taste! But that wasn't that great, either. I really wanted to love it, but alas... The hash browns were more of a shredded potato layer, and it was a bit limp. It would've been better with just a little bit of crisp. The eggs were good! But when they were gone, that left the potatoes with what looked an awful lot like canned mushrooms and what I honestly believe was one sausage link, sliced super thin and mixed in to the dish. \n\nOverall, I wasn't impressed by the food. That said, I would give Dale's another shot in the future. My expectations of the experience, though, will be fairly mediocre moving forward. Maybe someday they'll change that for me!

Four of us finished the hike about 30-40 minutes ahead the remaining 3, who had lingered to swim in the falls. Frost Gelato  made for the perfect stop as we waited for our friends to finish. \n\nI recommend the affogato. Authentic affogatos (affogati?) are composed of an espresso shot poured over a tiny little scoop of vanilla gelato. I love real Italian affogatos, but I much prefer the more substantial American version served by Frost. For about the same price as a medium, you can get TWO flavors of gelato and chocolate sauce covered in a generous serving of espresso and topped with whipped cream.

That's not a bad thing, but I was decidedly underwhelmed.  I had been hearing the burger raves for months, but had also heard about the 2-hour waits.  I had been waiting for just the perfect occasion, and it came on a random Wednesday afternoon at 3:30 while entertaining an out of town friend.  \n\nGarces has done a very nice job with the space, and has achieved a classy, old-school bar vibe.  The tiles and woodwork are beautifully restored, the mirrors are antiqued to perfection, most of the light fixtures are charming.  In light of how-well designed everything else seemed to be, the cheap white metal fluorescent fixtures above the bar with label glue still staining them stood out like sore thumbs.  But I digress . . .\n\nWe claimed a primo table by the bar and set out to enjoy the \"best burger in Philly\".  Our waiter was very friendly, helpful with beer selections, and solicitous without being intrusive.  My friend went with the burger as described on the menu; I added cheddar.  We split an order of duck fat fries and washed it all down with beer.  To get right down to business, the burgers (both ordered medium) were good.  They were so good that I did not even mind paying $10 for them.  However, they were NOT the best burgers in Philly.  Both were slightly overcoooked, and the meat, while juicy, would have benefited from a bit more salt or seasoning.  If I had waited 2 hours for the experience, I would have been right pissed.  The duck fat fries were very good - crunchy on the outside, redolent with duck fat flavor, and filled with fluffy potato-y goodness.  Though the order looked on the small side, they were rich enough that the two of us could not finish them.\n\nI expect I will be back to Village Whiskey.  I really dug the vibe, and I saw some intriguing cocktails being prepped with tender-loving-care at the bar.  I was entranced by the shaving of limes and muddling of herbs.  Speaking of cocktails, I ordinarily loves me some whiskey and the list at Village was pretty spectacular.  It makes it all the more sad that I will probably not be having any of them there.

Northern Liberties is now home to it's very own El Camino Real offering two menus of either Mexican or Barbeque fare.  In the resting place of the former Deuce in Liberties Walk, owner Owen Kamihira (also of Bar Ferdinand next door) has taken a swing at the ever growing mexican genre in the eastern most section between Spring Garden and Girard.  With SO many places in 10 square blocks to get nachos and burritos, can the king's highway possibly bring anything worthy to the table?  Can I at least get a decent margarita?!  Please?\n\nUpon entering El Camino, I notice that the kitchen has been opened up and the bar swings all around - similar to Johnny Brenda's.  The chairs have a mission-made look to them, the lights aren't too dark and the decor is far from overdone.  It's like, a restaurant!  The three flat screen tvs behind the bar are welcoming for those who want to keep up on the game.  For those trying to get away from the game, there's a large seating section in the back away from the bar and potential rowdiness of the inevitable Philly Phan.  \n\nWith so many mexican't offerings in the neighborhood, I focused completely on the barbeque.  You have your apps, ala carte, entrees and sandwiches and some sides to boot.  It turned out that because the place has been so busy in it's opening week they were out of a few items that I would have loved to give a try.  The menu includes pork ribs, beef ribs, short ribs, brisket, burger, shaved pork, links, and one seitan offering.   I went with brisket and shaved pork and a side of potato salad.  \n\nTo accompany my barbeque, I ordered an El Camino Margarita.  Folks, BEST margarita I've had in a long time!  It's five bucks and I really can't urge you enough to try one for yourself.  \n\nThe food arrives and I take a bite of my shaved pork.  I think it might be a pork loin, it's nothing like ham.  Much firmer and barbeque-y.  Very tasty and even better with the side of BBQ sauce.  The potato salad was splendid.  Some of the best I've had.  Rustic and creamy with red skin and chives and onions.  I've saved the best for last though.  I'm not sure if The King's Highway has a signature dish but I'm going to write a petition to have Great Northern Liberties Brisket Day.  My guess is a little more than a half pound of the slowest cooked beef ever to set foot this side of the Schuylkill.  Want to get your vegetarian friends to eat beef?  This is the deal my friend!  The only thing that could have made this MOUTH-GASM any better would be if there was six more pounds of it.  One of my dinning partners exclaimed that this beats ANY philly cheese steak ANY day.  Mr. Chef, I bow in your greatness.  \n\nObviously, no dessert would have been any better than the meal we just had but we had a shot at some banana pudding anyway, just to see if this place is still taking us seriously.  Sure enough, they've even managed to make the best pudding ever!  \n\nI just need to go back here as often as possible and try everything on the menu.  Next time will be the mexican for sure.

The smell of baked goods in the air also led us to order a strawberry filled sugar cookie whoopie pie which was on the dry side but rockin' in the flavor department. I could have gone for a whole scoop of that filling. The pops were not the best we've ever encountered so I'm going to throw my chips into the baked goods next time.

Our starters were \"the beets, the carrots, the leeks, and the dates.\" Don't ask me what the exact names are! Bottom line: they were all wonderful! The beets had little dill sprigs that added a nice touch to the flavor. The leeks melted in my mouth! The carrots were a nice surprise with the umami sauce. The dates were wrapped in bacon and the sweet/salty combo was perfect! Our mains were the Pork Belly Gnocchi and the Brisket Meatballs. I love gnocchi. Period. And this dish totally raised the bar! It was something so simple that was served in a tasty Southern fashion! I could go on and on about how much I loved the gnocchi and how I wished I could've kept it to myself (but I promised my husband I'd share)...! The meatballs were excellent! They had a nice kick to them...and the seasoning was spot-on! For dessert, we had the Chocolate Stout Cake and the Baklava. The cake was very sweet and rich. It's topped with salty pretzels that help balance out the sweetness. The Baklava was good, not great...but still good! It's like a \"deconstructed\" baklava. A phyllo nest topped with the fillings. Personally, it wasn't nutty enough and the rose jam kind of overpowered the rest of the flavors. Of course, that didn't stop us from licking the plate clean! I had an espresso, also.

Ever since Novemeber when these nice people opened up a beacon of deliciousness up the street, I feel finally as though my world of comfort food in proximity is more complete.\n\nGrowing up in the Bronx, surrounded by killa Puetro Rican and Dominican cookin, a redheaded stepchild develops mad hankerings that really take hold. For instance, mine is a life-long love of every incarnation of plantain. I mean, crispy tostones, or soft cartelized maduros, mofongo- they're just the epitome of comfort food for me, however you wanna prepare em, gimmmeee. \n\nI repeat, there is some good Latin home cookin happening at between 6th & 7th on South. You're covered whether you want a lil snacky, or, light-to-no-coma-more-of-a-heavy-nap inducer of a platter. Whadda joy to stop real in real quick, to this cafeteria style restaurant, for empanadas, or a Cuban sandwich, or those rellenos de papa! More of those potato balls later. You babies get your own paragraph.\n\nWe skew porky pernil (so juicy, fatty, and crispy skinned- every kinda porky way) when it comes to platters but have also developed a real habit with the tasty beef stew, too. These meats and many more, served platter-style, come with choice of type of rice and beans, a little salad, and then some so delicious maduros. So good. Sweet plantains: creamy sweetness between salty bites. I wax poetic about plantains. That's what happens.\n\nI'm such a fan of sides, though. That's where the ole gal gets herself into a real, \"Carb it up, carb face,\" situation, I'll call it. I could do me up a plate just like that. Like, all sides all day. If there was ever to be a national day dedicated to starchy carb feasts, I'd like to spend such a holiday here at Latin Flavor, cause all my favorites they gots.\n\nLatin Flavor's yellow rice and peas- arroz con gandules-  that's the move. We order extra sides of black beans, because they are perfect. Yuca frita is really crispy-fluffy and just what you want. If I mention plantains one more time your eyeballs will scream, but you know? \n\nAnd then there are the potato balls. The rellenos de papa. Do you want a crispy softball sized orb of seasoned mashed potatoes with a beefy center? You should. Cause they're dope. They're also the best that I've had in YEARS. Super flavorful. As other wise reviewers have noted- get em with gravy. Doooo it. \n\nNow here's the one thing, certainly you can scurry on home with generous portions of Latin platters, stuffed into take-out tins, but I say to you, eat your rellenos de papas at the restaurant for optimum excellence. Of course they'll still be good to-go, but take some time outta your life to enjoy the crispy, crispy, crispy outter shell in contrast to the mash and gravy. That's peak potato ball time.\n\nRight, so I command you: You sit there and eat your potato balls.\n\nAlright, you see what's happening here. I'm loving this spot for lunch and dinner and snacks and everything.

Steaks aren't chopped (not my usual style), they come on a fairly good roll, and with a healthy slathering-o-cheese.

What the kitchen got very right: the bread (e.g., the grain bread that came out first was awesome--I would stock my house with that bread, with the grains adding interest and texture without being dry), the Tuna Crudo (loved the celery leaves, crisp Granny Smith apple slices, and parsnip, though my fellow diner thought the mixture overpowered the fragile flavor of the tuna); the Spinach Gnocchi with Brown Butter (pillow-like gnocchi rivaling those found at Ristorante La Buca); the Almond Tortellini with Truffle Sauce (fantastic texture and a sop-every-last-drop-with-your-bread sauce!); the pre-dessert sweet cream gelato with fruit and lemon poppy-seed cake (tasted like a whipped-cream gelato with zesty, slightly sour fruit and a perfectly cooked cake); and the Chocolate Polenta Souffle (perfectly executed).\n\nAs I stated initially, it was a good meal.

It was enjoyable for sure, but I'd only come here maybe once a month for the extra pampering and a partial complimentary drink.

I did the Nouvelle pedi which includes a paraffin wax to soften dry cracked feet. Since my feet are so rough and cracked, yeah my feet aren't perfect people, I chose this. It was a wonderful treatment! My tech was Linh, she was so nice and gentle. I told her I like my nails cut to the shortest they can get them, and she listened to my wishes. I enjoyed a nice foot massage, and since my heels are chapped she brought out this cheese grater looking tool. It was ticklish and then afterward I was completely shocked how much better my feet looked and felt! Next followed a leg exploitation, and then a massage with a lotion or clay type mask. Then, se brought out the two bags of the pink wax. It was hot at first, but then it began to cool.  After it was dry, she removed the bags and the wax came off with ease. Lastly, she rubbed my legs down wth lotion. Now, I have a thing if it's too much lotion and it's a greasy slipper feel. Once we left, my husband noticed my legs had lotion caked and streaked on and it was very noticeable. I tried to blend it in, but it was already dried. When we get to La V for lunch I had to wash my legs off. I will definitely go back next month for more pampering, but in between I'll get a pedi at a normal price. My husband had mentioned when he came w Malary that they refilled their glasses during their pedis a few times, but today, we never were offered anymore. I love how my feet look at feel now! They also gave me useful tips on how to keep my heels soft and well moisturized between pedis. I look forward to going back whether I'm alone, with a friend or my husband. I'd like to get my eyebrows waxed next time. Clean salon, well lit with elegant chandeliers and clear pendant lighting. White booths for clients and a back room for the brow waxing and such.

Yet another grocery store in town!  I was actually pretty glad to hear Sprouts was coming to Tampa - I had shopped at one in Alabama, and loved their ready-to-eat section.\n\nSince I went on opening week, the parking lot was full as I expected, but fortunately the store is in the center of a huge strip mall, and there was plenty of parking to be had in front of other stores.\n\nSide Story #1 - as I was walking back to my car, I watched as a car pulled in next to mine, flung open her door, and whacked my car.  When I walked up to inspect it and said, \"Hey, you hit my car!\" the response I got back was an angry (at me) \"I barely touched it!\".  I suppose an \"I'm sorry\" was too much to hope for, in this day and age.\n\nWhen I walked into Sprouts, the first thing I noticed was the enormous selection of produce. I have heard it compared to Trader Joes and Fresh Market, but this section looked larger and fresher than either of those stores.  I also loved that they had a huge variety of fresh cut flowers and plants.\n\nSince I couldn't wait to get in and out of the madness that was the store on this day, I headed straight to the area that had pre-packaged food, and bought a smorgasbord of items to go:  buffalo nuggets (very spicy), turkey meatloaf with vegetables (surprisingly filling and good), a premade sandwich with deli buffalo chicken and tomatoes, which sadly had very soggy bread from the tomatoes, and falafel balls (see Side Story #2).  My biggest complaint with all the to-go food was that it was hard to get the plastic lids off, and that the plastic lids could not go in the microwave.\n\nSide Story #2 - the falafel balls are supposed to be microwaved for 2-3 minutes before eating them. I took the lid off, took the sauce out, and heated them up. They came out perfectly, and were delicious. There were so many in there though, I saved about half of them for the next day. Next day, heated the remainder up, and after about a minute the whole microwave started to smoke and I had to rush over and dump the flaming falafel balls in the sink!  Phew!  Boy did my house stink!  Apparently the falafel balls are a one-time-heat-up type thing - who knew?\n\nSo, other than the falafel excitement, I will definitely be heading back to Sprouts to try some of their other ready-made options.", "date": "2017-03-06 19:20:10"}, {"_key": "121527", "_id": "reviews/121527", "_rev": "_fNyp7g2--v", "review_id": "c4gO-BzimetcdpLspP5GkA", "user_id": "xqS2PjKu16g2cFDBNgJ8Ng", "business_id": "1gV0EbA00qcP7oZFrFhxUA", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "My favorite theater our of all of the AMC ones.

It is anything but ordinary with its exceptional montage of creative cuisines expertly paired with fantastic wines from their massive selection of old and new.  I am no wine expert so although I thoroughly enjoy sipping it, I will not even attempt to review it.  Cru Cellars is South Tampa's newest and best-hidden secret. Although located in a prime location on South Macdill with a clear street view and a large sign, Cru Cellars appears as a mere wine market.  Up until a couple of months ago, like many, I too was oblivious to the dimly lit, posh lounge nestled discreetly in the back of the market. This little secret has gradually been leaked to more and more wine and food-lovers alike who have been steadily making their way to wine and dine at this classy and quaint eatery.  Cru Cellars has only recently opened up their kitchen, enabling them to be part of Tampa's ever-growing culinary community.  Word of mouth has worked well for this up and coming food and wine gem and it seems they are responding well to the recent buzz.  Having visited the establishment twice now, both times a packed house, the ambiance, service and fare have been satisfyingly superb.  \n\nWith both visits to Cru Cellars, I have been blessed with wonderful service.  This wine bar may be refined, but in no way do the employees act pretentious.  Not only are they extremely knowledgeable with their wines and appropriate pairings, they are also friendly and very quick to please their guests. The carefully crafted menu includes a large list of chef-inspired eclectic small plates as well as a charcutterie board selection with a wide variety of tasty cured meats, exquisite artisanal cheeses and small bites such as olives and bruchetta.   These choices are accompanied by an array of delicious jams, mustards, nuts and crostini.  \n\n\nMy friends and I began with a charcuterie board.  We chose the two year-old gouda, the Cabot-cloth bound cheddar and the Kiev Russian-style salami. The board was presented attractively, though I did expect larger portions of cheese.  The salami had a nice salty bite and was particularly delightful with the gouda and crostini.  The cheddar was not as sharp as I had hoped and was slightly harder than I expected it would be.  The mustard and pecans were flavorful and added a perfect touch.  If I were to order a charcuterie board again, I'd probably lean toward the goats and sheep's milk cheeses instead.\n\nWe also ordered the half portion Roasted Mushroom Orzo.  Wow.  This dish was incredible.  Who knew orzo could be spruced up like this?  The fresh rosemary and thyme defined this glorious recipe and the bite from the Parmesan and the earthiness from roasted mushrooms was just outstanding.  The orzo came studded with bright red cherry tomatoes that served to add a pungent tang to the otherwise aromatic and rich ingredients.  Although not too complex, it was divinely rich and rustic with flavors my palate now constantly craves.  \nPer suggestion of our server, we then ordered the Coriander-crusted Pork tenderloin.  This plate was beautifully presented with Spanish olives and Yukon Golds as its tasty accompaniment.  The pork was melt-in-your-mouth tender and had flawless essence from the coriander.  Refined comfort food with its meat and potato front, the scrumptious reduction and the salty Spanish olives make it a creation worth the \"ohhh's and Ahhh's\" it received.  A rather large \"small plate,\" this dish was perfect for sharing amongst the four of us.  \nTo add to the already marvelous mix of cuisines, we ordered the flat bread with fig jam, arugula, bleu cheese and prosciutto.  The flat bread was delivered to our table bursting with colors.  The crust was crisp and tasty and the diverse flavors from the bold ingredients on top created quite the party in my mouth.  Intense bleu cheese, salty prosciutto, super sweet fig jam and the bitter arugula fashioned a brag-worthy combination I would recommend to all.  \n\nIf you haven't visited Cru Cellars yet, you are seriously missing out.  Delectable dishes are present as well as enough wines to satisfy the snobby.  They aim to please the hungry and the thirsty and do so with such eloquence; not a soul should leave disappointed.", "date": "2012-08-27 19:12:01"}, {"_key": "122130", "_id": "reviews/122130", "_rev": "_fNyp7hq--d", "review_id": "IQvDdRjTmHSSKgHGnRKdBw", "user_id": "RNWJx8g-TIMVn1fpNFOCvA", "business_id": "Dv6RfXLYe1atjgz3Xf4GGw", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I love this place.

Luke made it worth the wait.. \n\nMy wife and I love France and the food, while Luke is a mix of classic French and German flair the French side is definitely the shining star here.. \n\nThe decor is a bit simplistic, but in a good way. Light colored hardwoods and shared bench seating are both warm, comfortable and inviting.\n\nThe menu is is a bit German, a good amount of French and a splash of Creole added. \n\nWe started out with the gumbo which was perfectly balanced and seasoned well. I'm not a seafood lover and I have to say this was the best gumbo I have ever tasted, my wife agreed. \n\nOh before I forget.. The French bread and butter were done so well it would have made Lionel Poilane smile..\n\nFor mains my wife had the crab ravioli and I had the ribeye, both were excellent.\n\nThe pasta looked and tasted handmade and the sauce was creamy yet delicate, while the crab was fresh and large.\n\nThe ribeye I had was great, I want to address the comment below about  the ribeye being mostly fat.. Ribeyes are just that, a well marbled cut of meat which lends itself well to being slow roasted (Prime rib, Standing rib roast) when grilled the fat will be more prominent especially at lower temps.. Maybe he got a bad cut, but knowing your proteins is half the battle.. Back to the steak, I enjoyed my ribeye and the presentation on a wooden cutting board is a nice touch, however I did not care for the b\u00e9arnaise sauce.. The fries were a bit salty for me, but I'm a hypersensitive to course salts so some might like them.. After brushing the salt off the taste was spot on and tasted like they were fried in a good oil not just plain ole veg.\n\nFor dessert we split the bread pudding and were pleasantly surprised at the souffle style presentation.. The taste was good, however the ice cream could use some work and I would try another dessert next time.. Even with the ice cream, it's still a very, very good dessert, I'm just more of a chocolate lover.. \n\nDrinks at Luke are AMAZING! It's not the typical NO drinks, these are high end fine cocktails.. The French 75 is well worth the price of admission and the brandied cherries that are put in random drinks are out of this world good.. Also, any time someone goes to the trouble to put a super high end Italian steam pump espresso machine in his restaurant I'm impressed..

My bf was full of questions about screen printing that he probably spent a good half hour quizzing someone who works there. The salesmen, however, did not seem bothered by the questioning and ended up being really helpful. I was real happy to see that the people who work at the store really known how to work their products. And it looks like they're not BSing you to buy unecessary tools for projects.\n\nOh, did I mention my bf was extremely excited to have found a .3 lead pencil for his work.

This macaroni was thoughtfully seasoned (I know that sounds so pretentious, but it's the only way I could describe it) and worth choosing.  I am lactose intolerant, so I have to take medication to eat mac 'n' cheese, and I'd deem this worth it!  The sandwich was top notch too.  I really thought the ratio of sauce to meat was perfect, and the bread was good too.\n\nDan got a half rack of ribs, as well as the brisket chili.  I got to taste both, and it was delicious!  There's great brisket meat and spices in that chili.  I'd recommend this option too, if you're into ribs.  My cousin got the ribs, mac, and banana pudding.

These were by far my favorite part of the meal. It was perfect.\n\n- Louisiana Strawberry Tart -- We're stealing this and claiming it as an old family recipe passed down from our great grandparents. It was that good. Really solid execution. The basil ice cream was clearly made with fresh basil and packed too much flavor on it's own, but when eaten with the tart it was really well balanced. The tart almost tasted like it had a little custard in it and was really delicious.\n\n- Gulf Fish Tacos -- The only thing we ordered that we didn't love. It reallyyyyyyy needed something crunchy in it to give it texture/bite since it was a bit soft and squishy. My fianc\u00e9e actually couldn't handle the texture and ended up having to spit it out.

The saucing was a bit uneven since only one taco had enough sauce to really punch through and give it a vibrant flavor; the rest were just mushy and bland.", "date": "2015-01-23 16:03:12"}, {"_key": "122955", "_id": "reviews/122955", "_rev": "_fNyp7iu---", "review_id": "1M4oufCaT72IYkoac9RwPQ", "user_id": "wifiu6mD-T0f8aX7ksaIvA", "business_id": "0d223PXcDFzz52qLgSHFUA", "stars": 2, "useful": 8, "funny": 2, "cool": 1, "text": "First I want to start by saying that I truly applaud these guys for what they are trying to do. Local BMX and skateboard shops have completely disappeared in the Reno/Sparks area due to major retail stores like Scheels, Zumies, and Tillys. I wish that this was not the case. For me, walking into a bike shop that carried BMX supplies was like going to Disneyland. There is so much potential for Forever 2 Wheels but I'm just not sure that they know how to capitalize on it. I hope that the owners read this review and use it as constructive criticism in order to prosper.\n\nThe bike shop couldn't possibly be in a better location. Located directly across the street from Burgess Skate Park there is so much untapped potential. I was riding the park and asking the people there if they knew of any good places where I could go to find a new bike tire. Turns out that all the riders there just referred to purchasing them online. Nobody even knew that this shop existed, let alone that it was right across the street from where we were! They should really work on reaching out to the community. If I worked at this shop I would get in contact with the City of Sparks and apply for a permit to hold a park jam where I could bring awareness to the demographic in which is their ideal customer base. Hold contests and give away some things for winners, throw out swag, and build up facetime with the kids.\n\nNow for the shop itself. Walking into the shop it feels more like an old garage than anything. There is way way too much used equipment. It seems to be a second hand store. The frames, wheels, and even shoes that they have are all so antiquated and gross that I wouldn't even be able to give them away for free. All that stuff would be given to Goodwill without doubt. who is trying to buy old beat-up skate shoes?  The pictures they have posted on their Yelp just go to prove this point. There is new equipment but there is also problems with their inventory of that. You guys are located across the street from a skate park but you are not carrying park equipment. I was in there for a street tire and there was only one. The tire was mangled and there was no chance that it would have even been up to manufactures standards, plus they were asking way too much for it. I could order the same tire online, have it overnight delivered, and still end up paying less. I love to buy local but that doesn't mean that I am willing to overpay for it. You have to offer competitive prices to your biggest competitors like Danscomp.com\n\nOverall I just feel that the guys at this shop are not up to date with sport. I believe that they once had a passion for riding bikes but have since been separated with the current trends. I really do hope that they succeed and learn what the bike community is looking for. As for now Forever 2 Wheels just isn't there and I think that they are going to end up losing more customers than they can attract. I will try back in a few months to see if anything changes but until then, online shopping it is. Hopefully I can change this review in the future.", "date": "2016-02-25 22:12:51"}, {"_key": "122960", "_id": "reviews/122960", "_rev": "_fNyp7iu--D", "review_id": "V1gZTbmPoJIed8DW4XK6gg", "user_id": "WY7FOzVi4Fa9zezilupH5w", "business_id": "VJEzpfLs_Jnzgqh5A_FVTg", "stars": 2, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I went to Jasmine Rice on a Friday at 8pm.

I love nothing more than burgers & fries, but this is just a little off from being a great burger place. \n\nI dinned here on a Sunday afternoon, around 1:30pm. The restaurant was pretty busy, a large church crowd present. I entered the building & was greeted by one of the two unfriendly, female hostesses. I didn't know if she was a hostess or not because I had to say hello first to her. I thought by the look she gave me that I was just talking to a teenage girl that was standing near the hostess stand. \n\nWe were sat at a high top table & was greeted by a friendly waitress.

Burger Up! prides themselves on using local meet & produce. The beef was nice, but didn't have much favor, it needed a little salt & pepper & maybe a little more fat for flavor. The mushroom & Swiss comes with onions with horseradish sauce. The sauce didn't have much flavor, which I was surprised by, because horseradish is a very intense flavor. The fries were okay. They are cut from the potato with the skin on, which I like, but they tastes too greasy for me. The fries also didn't have much flavor other than grease. \n\nOverall, for 11 dollars, the burger tasted like a 6 dollar burger.

It's very awkward to have to slip into the small space in between the toilet and shower in order to open and close the door.  And as mentioned in another review, it seemed curious to me why they'd dedicate so much extra space to the room itself, and leave so little for the bathroom -- It's not like use of that room is optional!\n\nWe'd stayed at a competitor's similar-tier hotel the night before and loved the free breakfast there, so in contrast we found this one disappointing.  The breakfast sandwiches were pre-assembled (English muffin with egg, meat, and cheese), so if you didn't like something on them you were out of luck.  There weren't any other hot items provided, and not much else to choose from.  The breakfast area was also messy and picked over.\n\nThe front desk staff was great -- friendly and efficient.  We asked for a dinner recommendation because we'd seen two barbecue places nearby, and we weren't sure whether to go to one of them or another one we'd been to before a few miles away.  She sent us to Judge Bean's BAR-B-QUE, and we had a wonderful dinner as a result.\n\nWould we go back?  For the price, room size, and location, yes.

The restaurant is only half a block to my apartment, so I pass by it all the time and after trying it for the very first time when it first opened. I couldn't honestly call myself a fan. What can I say? I ordered the kebob and everybody who knows anything about Greek/Turkish food is that kebobs are the most generic thing on the menu and can't really reflect the skills of the chef. On top of that the restaurant is popular and the space is small with tables arranged very closed to each other and I'm a bit claustrophobic. At the end of the meal I freaked out  a little and had to run out of the restaurant to catch a breath. After that experience I was a bit afraid to go back. Then there was a pretty long and angry respond to a newspaper review that got pasted on the window of the kitchen, I'm sure I'm not the only one who got weirded out by it.\n\nIt wasn't until Food Network's The Best Thing I've Ever Ate that got me pay more attention to my Greek neighbor. I went back for the Cyprus breakfast promoted by the program and it was good, real good. Everything on the plate was done perfectly; Eggs are fried to a crispy edge with the center remains raw, bread is toasted to a crunchy goodness, lounza ham is salty and dry is a good way. and can I just scream how I love the Halloumi cheese especially when it's fried to a crispy outside and a melty inside? I can have that everyday and be content. \n\nA second visit to the same plate proves that it's better to visit on weekdays when there are less patrons and the cooks can pay more attention to the food. On weekends, the quality can suffer because of the rush. The wait staff is knowledgeable and friendly, the decor simple and homey. I think they took the kebob out of the menu and I remember the dip being stellar. They also seemed to have a cooking class held on weekends sometimes, check their glass window.

Some very negative.  Others slightly positive.  Most complimented the food but nothing spectacular. \n\nSo, this past Friday night a few friends and I got together for dinner and I wanted to try some place new.  I put out a list of 3 new places (new to me anyway) I'd like to try - based upon the Menu.  I listed Red Pony in Franklin, Burger Up and Tavern.  I sent my friends links to the restaurants and ultimately we agreed that Tavern would be the place.  \n\nWe arrived at 7:30 and ended up having to wait an hour for a table and they don't take reservations.  That was fine.  We figured about anywhere we went on a Friday night at this point we would encounter a wait of similar length.  So, we waited and ordered a couple cocktails while we waited.  \n\nThis is probably the biggest downside of the restaurant.  They don't have a place for you to really wait.  The bar was jam packed and there was no seating up front.  There was seating outside on the patio - but no one was out there because it was raining and cold.  So, we stood inside near the door for an hour.  \n\nWhen we were finally seated the server asked us if we needed any more drinks and if we wanted any appetizers.\n\nWe decided to go with the 'Bazooka\" Guacamole Appetizer.  I pretty much hate Guacamole and never order it anywhere.  I've tried it several times many different places.  Never liked it.  But, this was supposed to be 'different' with some goat cheese and other stuff in it as well.  The presentation of the appetizer was very cool.  They bring it out in a 2-3\" deep round cake pan lined with parchment or wax paper - I don't really remember.  Inside there is a glass jar with one of those hinged glass lids on top and its filled with this guacamole concoction.  They have a few chips out on the pan, however, there is also a small, brown paper bag with the logo of 'Tavern' on it - and it is filled with chips.  We took the small server spoon and each took a dollop of the guacamole and put it on a chip.  Wow!  Absolutely incredible.  I don't know if it qualifies as guacamole or not (I'm sure some purists would say it doesn't) - but whatever it is or whatever you want to call it - it was incredible.  I couldn't get enough.  We were scraping the bottom of the jar trying to get every last ounce of this wonderful, tasty spread.\n\nMoving onto dinner two of us go the Tavern Burger.  This burger is made with Prime Rib and Filet.  2 excellent cuts of meat - ground up and made into a burger.  I had mine with White Cheddar and bacon and was incredible!  Everything was good.  The meat, the bacon, the cheese - even the bun was tasty.  My friend had his plain and loved it as well.  Both burgers were served with fries.  He had the regular fries - I had mine tossed in Parmesan and garlic.  Either way they were good.  Apparently they serve them several different ways.\n\nAnother friend got the 'Mama Sans Fried Chicken'.  He was blown away by how much food he got.  He also was surprised at how well the chicken went with the cold noodles he was served as the side.  He said the cold noodles were a good juxtaposition against the hot chicken. \n\nMy other friend got the \"Salad of Little Gems\".  It looked a bit small to me but he claimed to really enjoy it.  As far as salads go it did look great.\n\nThe food was all served rather quickly but the pacing of the meal was on point.  The appetizer was served and finished well ahead of the meal making its way from the kitchen.  Too often I feel rushed and sometimes the appetizers and entree arrive within second of each other.  Sometimes even together!  I think the pacing of the meal was excellent.  Also, our server was great and our glasses were never empty.  She made sure we always had plenty to drink.\n\n4 Cocktails, 4 entree's, 1 appetizer = $94 bucks after tax and everything.  So, around 20 bucks a person for a night out.  \n\nSo, to review:\n\nLong wait - no place to really sit.  They DO take your phone number and will call you when your table is ready so you can make your way back to the restaurant.\n\nService was excellent.  Drinks were never empty.  Pacing of meal was great from the appetizer to the main course.\n\nPrice was fine.  We could have eaten for less if we didn't get cocktails, appetizers AND the main course.  If we'd just had water and our meal - we would have spent a lot less.  The cocktails were pricy - but pretty stout.  They didn't skimp on the alcohol for sure.\n\nI think it was wonderful and we are already planning our next trip!

Those weren't homemade, but that's no biggie for me. I will definitely be back here again. Next time, I'd like to try their margaritas! They have a ton of different specials listed on the wall too.

I also enjoy collecting the wide array of colored cups.

It was a good idea, as the experience was great.\n\nWe were seated immediately in the upstairs area, had menus right away, and a drink order placed within two minutes despite the buzzing crowd. Very nice! Sunday is a good time to stop by, as their \"Sunday School\" specials are excellent (both in price and selection). \n\nWe ordered several small plates to start...roasted beets with feta, wild mushroom and raclette fondue, and butternut squash with bacon and goat cheese. All were very tasty, especially the fondue. I knew this place was special when the supply of toast for the fondue was dwindling, yet more fondue remained...I thought of asking for more toast, but was almost expecting some sort of \"umm, sorry, we can't blah blah\". The idea of eating fondue with a spoon crossed my mind when out of nowhere our server appeared with a plate of more toast. Without us asking. Bonus!\n\nWe then had a cheese plate (an Italian truffle cheese). It was soooo smooth and delish, and came with a little extra bit of squash...it allowed for a completely different, yet intriguing taste combination. \n\nDid I mention they have Dogfishhead 120 Minute IPA on tap? Well, they DO. I love that beer more than any other, and even though they limit you to one 5oz glass per person, I was thrilled to find it on the menu. I'd be more thrilled if I could've ordered another, but oh well.\n\nThe only thing keeping Tria from 5 stars is the music selection/noise level...too mainstream, too loud. Put on some Michel Camilo and treat some of the hard surfaces and you will match the vibe perfectly.
