My friend and I were seated pretty quickly with no reservations. We arrived at the restaurant around 5:30pm, on a Friday.\n\nThey have a pretty wide selection of sushi to choose from. I love how the menu includes pictures so you have an idea of what the food looks like. \n\nMy friend and I ordered : Sushi pizza (salmon), sushi sandwich (salmon), sushi cake (salmon), prawn tempura (6 pieces) and tempura ice cream (mango). We are major raw salmon sashimi fans and this was definitely reflected in our selections.\n\nThe prawn tempura came out first. The tempura was crispy and temperature was nice and hot. \n\nNext came the sushi sandwich - definitely shareable. There were 6 giant triangle pieces - altogether almost the size of 3 normal sandwiches. My friend opted to not have the Oranj sauce (not too spicy mayo) on this. It still tasted okay but was drier minus the sauce and thus a tad harder to eat. I dunked it in soy sauce to compensate. It had rice and nori (for the bread) and salmon, avocado and purple onion inside. \n\nThe sushi cake arrived next. It came in 8 rectangular shaped sushi pieces. Also very shareable. Easy to eat because of the Oranj sauce was drenched on top. This too had salmon and avocado layered between. I really liked this!\n\nThe sushi pizza had a 1/2 inch thick rice patty that  was kinda breaded and fried. The \"pizza\" was topped with avocado, fresh tomatoes and salmon. The taste was just okay. This was supposed to come with Oranj sauce but my friend opted to not have this. Personally, I think the sauce makes a difference in terms of making things taste better and easier to swallow. \n\nFinally, the tempura on the tempura ice cream kinda fell off the mango ice cream but I still found it pretty tasty! The tempura part kind of tasted like yellow cake. An cute touch was the 2 strawberry Pocky sticks (Asian crackers shaped like sticks and dipped in different flavors).\n\nAn interesting and slightly weird thing about this place is the washroom. You walk out through the back of the restaurant and partially into another restaurant! The washroom is technically in another restaurant!\n\nOverall, I'd consider coming back here to try the other items on the menu. The prices are a bit expensive but the portions are pretty generous. Our bill ended up coming to $71.40 and we didn't even order any drinks - just water. It's not the best sushi in the world but it's also not the worst either. \n\nThe service was okay. The waitresses were somewhat attentive but at times difficult to get in contact with. It's not a very big restaurant. There were 2 waitresses and 1 hostess.\n\nIf I'm in the mall, I MIGHT give it a try if I'm in the mood for some quick Japanese food.

My wife and I had our wedding a month ago (December 2014) in Solvang, and finding the right DJ had been our highest priority. She believed from the beginning that this could make or break the party, and after seeing how perfectly it went off, I see that it all really did hang in that balance. I admit that I was stuck in pricing from the 90s and didn't plan to spend what we did on this aspect of the wedding, but now I know I'd easily pay much more for the quality we received. (Side note: we skimped on the video people and got what we paid for).\n\nGavin deejayed the event, but the overall company gave us real peace of mind from our very first phone call. Their online planning tool taught us what events we'd need music for, and they even provided all of the music and equipment for the ceremony. \n\nOn our RSVP form, we had asked our guests, \"What song is guaranteed to make you get up and dance?\" - a question we weren't sure we'd ever get answered, let alone use at the event. However, their responses flowed in, and we sent them along to Gavin. Not only did he use every song - which kept our floor filled all night - but he mixed them so expertly that the beats seemed to match song to song to song in short intervals. The requests from guests weren't even all dance-friendly, but he made them danceable!!! We really had a pro dance party there thanks to him. \n\nAbove all, it must be mentioned that our event was no typical affair for a deejay. I wish I could say we made it easy on him, but at least 5 different people had surprises that Gavin had to keep secret and straight from the next.  This could have led to several miscues and mistakes - but not on Gavin's watch. He nailed every single cue with the perfect song intro or mic placement.  All of this while playing master of ceremony. \n\nGavin, Carly, and team, we cannot thank you enough for what you did for us. People are still talking about the wedding almost a whole month later, and everyone wants us to know that we had the greatest DJ.  We are so lucky, and could not be more grateful. \n\nTHANK YOU!!!!", "date": "2015-01-06 01:27:12"}, {"_key": "100030", "_id": "reviews/100030", "_rev": "_fM1zFJ2--X", "review_id": "w361uPco0-NbPiKt88lRUg", "user_id": "Dfqrl77D1EhDHnOMh9jvxA", "business_id": "ySSOZ_fz7wMhfjhWKzdR-w", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Great food and amazing server Alexis; would highly recommend if you need a quick bite to eat and are in the area.", "date": "2015-03-07 00:29:14"}, {"_key": "100031", "_id": "reviews/100031", "_rev": "_fM1zFJ2--Y", "review_id": "REmC_-oHdc8GJ5y9jmuQ8Q", "user_id": "use5g5JyrHm3_GUX7KvthA", "business_id": "EDjEVzmoQVHzboFqC-M6Ew", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "The Local Taco is not fine dining, but is a great spot to grab a few quick and delicious tacos.

We were staying at the Hyatt Regency so it was just a quick walk from there. We arrived around 10 AM and there was no wait for our little party of two. We got to sit outside, which was great because it was breezy and not too hot. \n\nI'm not a coffee drinker, but my wife loved that they bring you out your very own carafe for coffee and you don't have to ask for refills. They do the same with water as well, which was great for me. I also wanted a chocolate milk, but I kept forgetting to ask the server. This is where the lack of a 5th star comes in. We only saw our server a few times throughout the whole meal. When I did finally ask for the chocolate milk, I was halfway down with my food (my fault, not the server), but by the time she brought it out I had finished my food. She did make up for it by not charging for it, and she even brought me the large size (I ordered small) in a to-go cup since we were done eating. The chocolate milk itself was a disappointment, though. It just tasted like milk with chocolate syrup mixed in.\n\nFor our meal, my wife and I got the exact same thing: The Trifecta breakfast. We both did scrambled eggs, the Belgian waffle, and bacon. I also got a side of the seasoned potatoes. I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the waffle since it wasn't the whole entree. And it was so good! It was so soft and fluffy. The whipped butter spread easily over it, and the syrup they bring you is hot (a must for me). I did try one bite with the berry compote, but I prefer syrup. The bacon was cooked perfectly--crispy but not overdone. The seasoned potatoes were good too, although I like crispy fried potatoes at breakfast better. \n\nOverall we really enjoyed our breakfast here.

Broth (of any kind) can be dull and bland but Saigon Restaurant does not allow such characteristics in their fabulous Pho broth.  The accoutrements are always fresh--basil, bean sprouts, jalapeno, lime.  Don't forget to pop those into your steamy hot bowl of soup for added freshness and flavor.  Fresh Spring Rolls are also pretty decent too, but not as superb as the Pho.  \n\nThe service is genuine, never over-the top/goober-friendly/fake-smiles.

I'm not much of a pancake eater but we decided to try this place anyways. I got the Chef's Medley (which is Hash with a fried egg on top and a picante sauce). The picante sauce wasn't terrible and the dish was meh. I wasn't really into it and had about 1/4. \n2. The coffee was also very meh. I get better out of my Keurig. BUT we did just drive 7 hours and had 7 hours to drive home so caffeine was welcomed with open arms, good or bad. \n3. Our waitress and the service was middle-of-the-line. I've experienced way better and I've experienced way worse. She wasn't rude but there was no \"southern charm\" either. Just meh. In fact, she seemed far more interested in pushing us out than she was in quality of her work or of the food. \n\nAll in all, I'd normally probably rate this place 1 star. \n\nHOWEVER, my boyfriend got the pigs in a blanket (breakfast sausages wrapped in pancakes) and that alone redeemed two stars.

I think it's casual enough where it would work just about anywhere.  \nWe split a salad called Burrata al Pomodoro and had two small pastas; Casoncelli and cannelloni.  The large and small portions were perfect for us.  All three of these dishes were not just good, but were all pretty special.   A couple of warnings, though:  the Casoncelli has a very strong mushroom flavor and the small size cannelloni was small than a lot of tapas I've had, maybe half the size of my palm.

Let me try a place in West Chase instead of waiting for dinner.\" I figured there was one in the Publix Shopping Center so I google mapped it. The review I read said give this place a try so I did. \n\nI called in an order for Egg Drop Soup and Sesame Chicken Combo. I arrive 15 minutes later only to have to wait for another 10.

I hate this kind of fried rice. It's always mushy and tasteless in my experience, not to mention it creeps me out. I tried to keep an open mind as I dug into the Egg Drop. It was down right gelatinous, yick. I heated it up in the microwave since that can happen a bit when it nears room temp (which it was) but it was way to thick to eat. The sesame chicken's outer crust was weird. It's was fried but broke apart weird in your mouth like it was a bit overcooked. This dish was also EXTREMELY SALTLY. Now, I can be a bit sensitive to salt but I had my coworker try it and she agreed. On the flip side, the rice was just as I expected, mushy and tasteless. \n\nOne reviewer said that it wasn't the worst Chinese food she had ever had and gave it two stars. I wouldn't go back.

I had the crab meat omelette and it was alright at best, but not worth the wait or the price. My friend liked his bananas foster french toast, so possibly I should have ordered the other recommended items.\n\nWhat really made this experince a 2 star as opposed to a 3 star was the staff messed up our check. We waited 10 minutes to finally get their attention to send the check over, only to have the bill twice the actual price. I'm pretty certain the check was meant for the table of 5 next to us, so I'm sure they were happy getting a $35 bill. There wasn't really a sense of urgency in getting the check out of the way, which might have explained the extremely long wait to get into the restaurant. \n\nMaybe we came on a bad day, maybe I ordered the wrong item, and maybe the waiter was new. Either way, I wouldn't recommend this place despite the high reviews.

So I'm pleased to write that Deep Sea keeps up their end of the bargain with an assortment of pretty good wines.  Again, you wouldn't expect to find such a beautiful and relaxing spot with good wines in such an obvious location, but trust me, I wouldn't steer you wrong.\n\nHere are my suggestions for your afternoon visiting Deep Sea.  First, spring for a tasting.  Either their regular one or the select tasting will be fine.  I think the regular is ten bucks and the select one is twenty.  Take your time on each of the wines and pick one that you can all agree on.  Buy a bottle of the favorite and enjoy it on their patio right on the ocean.

Well Crafted just opened up last week.\nSuper attractive interior, bright room and tons of tables to accommodate large crowds. A permanent stage with a huge logo that changes colors. Nice little (not little) touch to the place. Looking forward to seeing some live music up on that stage space.\nAs of opening week, there were 6 beers flowing. A decent start. I ordered a 12oz. Coffee Porter ($5.50) that was fantastic. Also enjoyed their flagship Pale Ale (Tire Kicker), which was also quite good, so they know how to brew and looking forward to some more creative options as they play around with the hoppy beers. They also had a Hefeweizen, a couple saisons (standard and a dry hopped version) and their Porter without the coffee. \nThe one downside was the roasted veggie tacos. 2 flour tacos taken out of the bag and hot/wet veggies poured inside, so once they got to me, you picked up the tacos and everything just fell out thru the soaked bottom. They better work on this ASAP or they'll lose folks wanting to eat there. Veggies were OK, but chopped up in small bits and nothing at all substantial to feel like I received $11 worth of food. Comes with one side. I went with the slaw and it was also the smallest portion one could receive and not good at all. Tasted yogurt based and slightly sour. Very forgettable. \nBavarian pretzel was very good too. Also a bit overpriced at $11. Served with a few dipping sauces, but again, very small portions. You would easily run out if you tried to use just one for  the entire pretzel, so I hope you enjoy them all. One was a beer cheese and not sure on the others. One was very sweet.\nI won't knock them down a peg just yet, as the service was super friendly and the place was kept very clean with all hands on deck taking care of customers.

We were reunited and it felt so good.\n\nThe cocktail list was quite nice and there was also a decent selection of wines to chose from which were featured at 25% off for the evening. However, we are good at drinking and went for DRINKS. The gentlemen had a gentle Fleur di Lis, the house specialty. I didn't care for it, he claimed it to be reminiscent of lemon gatorade. We drank it, obviously, but switched to beer immediately thereafter. Good selection of beers on draft and bottle as well.\n\nWe went ahead and ordered the tuna. It was seared and sliced ever so delicately. It was paired with toasted baguette slices and a nice horseradish aioli. I dominated that tapa and didn't let my lover even look at it. It was phenom.\n\nWe also ordered the scallop gratin; for the price tag, I was rather displeased. Minimal amount of scallop- too much potato.\n\nWe had some sort of trout dip dish. It came out looking like tuna salad that was sprinkled with french fried onions. The taste was pleasant, but the presentation definitely left something to be desired. I give this dish a FAIL.\n\nThe best part of the dining experience was the sliers. Fried chicken, cheddar, bacon and sausage gravy! Another had lamb and chutney.

I hadn't thought too much about it, but when I walked in, I realized the Saturday before Thanksgiving probably wasn't the best day to go to Hobby Lobby. The lines went halfway back into the store and I could have cried. But it's a colossal pain in the neck for me to get to any Hobby Lobby in the Nashville area, so stick it out I would. I finished my shopping and went to stand in line, expecting to get fully caught up on all of the emails I was behind on. Check out at Hobby Lobby is a slow process, because they haven't made it to the 21st century and computers yet. I know this because I had the unenviable job of Hobby Lobby cashier in high school (admittedly that was many, many years ago). \"No ma'am, I cannot scan the bar code to get the price. Why, you ask? Well, because I'm using the same registers my grandfather had in his hardware store a generation and a half ago.\" But I digress. \n\nIt was 12:10 when I got in line. There were maybe four people ahead of me and it only took a few minutes for two of them to be processed out. When I looked up from my email backlog and realized how far I'd moved up in the line, I was kind of taken aback. Then a cashier came over to me and asked if I was just checking out or if I had any returns. Having no returns or exchanges, she said she was able to check me out at the next register. I went to her register, got rung up, took my buggy to my car, unloaded everything into my car, took the buggy back to the store, went back to my car, and looked at my phone. 12:20. It took only ten minutes for me to wait in line and get checked out at mid-day on a Saturday during the holiday season. This so incredibly amazing! I'm not sure what kind of sorcery they have going on at this store, but this is most definitely the only Hobby Lobby I'm going to from now on!

If I were to revisit( a good chance I will) I'd probably opt for bar area, especially during happy hour since those specials are not offered in dining room. Trish made the reservation for our group and ran into one glitch, the day of the event our 5:30 was changed to 5:00 by the restaurant. This was supposedly to accommodate another party at 7. We were not rushed out when that time approached but we also saw no sign of another party. \n\nI first perused the beer offerings, there seemed to be at least 10 on draught and some earlier offerings in cans. I selected their blueberry Hefeweizen and enjoyed the crisp flavor on this warm night, even though little to no berry taste came through. I would probably try something else next time. The food menu was possibly too large( in my opinion) with sandwich, pizza, apps and entrees offered. I was very hungry and 75% of the menu appealed to me, so I went to our excellent server Frank for his advice. He suggested a few dishes and I thought my beer choice would pair nicely with the pan roasted chicken entree. It proved to be good advice, a nicely cooked Frenched breast with the skin crispified served with what seemed to be local asparagus and mashed potatoes. The fowl was tender and juicy still, the pan sauce was lightly citrusy and herbed, it was good but could have been better if reduced and thickened. The mashed were ok, and probably the weakest link in the dish. I had an add on Caesar salad that was fair and overpriced( as add ons go) at $6. Trish went with his advice and ordered a shrimp and scallops special, she loved it and I have to admit, they are sourcing quality crustaceans.\n\nMost others in our group ordered burgers and we heard many good things.

We visit New Orleans once a year for the past several years and just added this to our must visit list for when we are in town (along with Willie Mae, Mothers and Cafe du Monde, and Big Fisherman). \n\nWe came here for a second dinner (around 9:45 PM so no wait) during one of our food conquests. The 5 of us ordered family style so we can try a little bit of everything. Our orders were delish, good quality and good taste. Everything on the dish made sense and the flavors complimented each other (not like this other place we went to during our food conquest).\n\nTerrine Of Slow Cooked Foie Gras - Frois gras patte. I've had some in the past that didn't fare so well. Not the same as frois gras saut\u00e9ed, but done well. I'd order this again. \n\nCrawfish Bisque - Utter creamy goodness for crawfish lovers. You really taste the crawfish. \n\nSalad Luke- Liked the salad. Get a lil of everything on one fork and it's a nice fresh bite. Creamy, sweet and sour. One negative, it was too overdressed. Maybe because it was late, the kitchen person had a heavy hand. Would still get again and ask for less dressing. \n\nEntrec\u00f4te Grill\u00e9e Et Frites- Rib eye steak with fancy butter done right. All 5 of us hands down LOVED this dish. \n\nFresh gulf fish of the day was sheepshead fish battered. - At the end of the trip we didn't want anymore fried food, but this dish was okay. It was gone by the end of the evening even though we were full. \n\nPoulet Grand-m\u00e8re - Normally I do not like chicken. It's usually white meat and dry. However, this is a half chicken (bones and all) and makes it to my top chicken meals. The chicken was moist, flavorful, and went so well with Allen Benton's bacon and the mixed veggies. One small downside is the mash was on the salty side, but we'd order this again. Another 5/5 at the table.\n\nBrendan's Bread Pudding- The only other place I've had this better was at a top US steakhouse. Very good. \n\nSteamed Chocolate - Gone in 1 minute. \n\nBourbon Vanilla Bean Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e - Also good. \n\nAll in all, 5 out of 5 of us liked Lukes.

The pizza was of Pizza Hut quality, and the crust was noticeably stale as if it was pulled out of the oven centuries ago.

This is a Jordanian restaurant with a wide mix of foods available. I enjoy coming here because the service is good and the staff are always attentive. It is also clean and comfortable.\n\nI always order a hot tea with mint when I come here.  They use tea bags but they are using tea that is popular in the middle east.  They will refill your tea cup with hot water if you ask.  I wish they would brew their own tea though and this would be a great thing.  \n\nMy favorite appetizer is the Foule.  It is puree of fava beans, some garbanzos spiced with garlic, jalapeno, lemon, olive oil and parsley.  It is served warm and with pita bread.  I love that this place gives enough bread and you do not have to ask for more.  If you are running low they ask you if you would like more.  Great customer service.  Another appetizer I like is Mesabaha a puree of chickpeas and humus with humus, jalapeno, olive oil, parsley and garlic.  The Babaganoush is also good and it has a nice smokey flavor. \n\nTheir lentil soup is well seasoned and you can taste the flavor of cumin \n\nI usually get a sandwich because it is a smaller portion than a whole plate of food since I get an appetizer as well when I come and otherwise I would not be able to eat all the food.  I would recommend the Kufta Kabob sandwich (seasoned ground lamb patties), Chicken Shawarma with their amazing garlic sauce.  My all time favorite is the Falafel sandwich with tahini sauce.

He's the used car manager and really he's the only one I even halfway trust there.  I bought my car here and I think I managed to get a good deal.  Patrick, the finance manager guy, was really impatient and intimidating, getting almost rude when I asked to take a minute to make a phone call to get advice.  This was the largest purchase I'd made up to this point in my life and I wanted to get as much info as I could.  I wanted to get input from a few of my friends who've done this once or twice before, but every time I'd ask to take a minute he'd get visibly frustrated and make a snide comment disguised as a joke about how the warranty is going to run out before we get the sale done or something.\n\nJoe, however, was the one doing most of the legwork - getting me a good insurance rate and taking care of everything.  When he told me the bank needed an extra $1k on the down payment he knocked $500 off the price and got my car certified (it wasn't certified, initially).  So if he's too busy moving cars and keeping the place from falling down he'll point you to someone he knows can help you.  Yea he's a sales guy, but I actually felt like he cared.  When I brought the car back in to get it certified he sat down and chatted with me in the 3 minutes he had to spare and then he gave me a hug when I left!  He understands that a car is a huge purchase, no matter how much or how little you can afford.  I got a good price on a 5 year old car, but he still treated me like I was spending $30k on a new car...  He was patient with my nervousness and made me feel at ease.\n\nI give the place only 3 stars because while I was sitting there waiting for my car to get done I witnessed what I always thought was a joke about car dealers...  Brown tweed suit, ugly plaid tie and old, ugly brown wingtips, topped off with a bad toupee...  This guy was trying to tell these two guys who obviously weren't native-English-speakers that the price on the internet is the price that they'd have to pay - that they can't negotiate...  He was trying to get them to pay MSRP and all I wanted to do was go over and be like \"Dudes, you're getting ripped off...  Go home and come back tomorrow and ask for someone else.\"\n\nIf you know what you're doing this place is great.

Even the yarn.) \nI don't feel like I'm paying through the teeth, and I typically get what I want for the project I came in to enhance. \n\nI know jack-if-all about the needlepoint stuff, but apparently it's quite good. \n\nThe wife falls over drooling with dinner-plate eyes every time we come here because it is a visual treat. There are tin things hanging from the ceiling, ribbons and bows all around, needlepoints and yarn and fiber and colors just exploding. Basically, New Orleans in yarn store form. Hot damn. \n\nAccessibility notes: Store is up one step, and the doorway is narrow. Very little space for mobility devices to maneuver. No braille signage. The store is small so it can get loud if it's crowded.

I was also amazed to find out that they microchip your pet for only $10.  Thats crazy!  At a price that cheap, I don't think anyone has an excuse to not have it done so if you lose your pet, they are returned safely!  The clinic points out that their main purpose is to spay/neuter cats and dogs so any other services they provide have to be with the main service (fixing pet).  However, November was the 3rd month in a row where once a month they have a clinic day and do walk in hours to microchip pets for the $10 special (and you don't have to have pet fixed).  If you don't want to wait a whole month or it's bad timing, MACC (metro animal care and control) does microchip for $25 and most vets will do it for $40-60.  I'm hoping maybe they will continue to have the monthly microchip clinic day and it will be so popular that they will do it twice a month.  I have to admit though that having my cat microchipped this past weekend was a little stressful. There were some rowdy dogs and it put my normally chill cat on edge.  (keep pets in car or outside of clinic until they're ready for you)  Aside from that, it literally took the staff a minute to microchip her.

It was the night of the Super Bowl so we found a restaurant with only two other guests in the dining area and just a handful at the bar. In other words, we had a restaurant to ourselves. Having a restaurant to yourself doesn't guarantee great service, but we got it anyway. Good start so far. Zea Rotisserie and Grill is great option for those looking to take a break from Po' Boys, Jambalaya's, and fried food.  What you'll find is a restaurant chain that serves seafood, sandwiches, Asian based BBQ, grilled food, and of course, rotisserie.  I can almost compare Zea to a Cheesecake Factory, but with a better food presentation and a dining experience that mimics fine dining.   \n\n-Garlic Hummus pita: This was our appetizer for the evening. I haven't had garlic based hummus before and pleased that I did. You still get the texture and taste of what you expect with hummus, but with an added buttery garlic taste to it. There's more hummus than there is pita and they are willing to hook up extra pita if needed.  (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Ov8JM-bcpHBtL30bGfPkKw&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ)\n\n-1/2 Chicken & 1/2 BBQ Ribs Plate: This meal is big enough to serve 2, maybe even 3. The ribs are glazed with BBQ sauce and the meat is \"fall off the bone\" and \"melt in your mouth\".  As for their chicken, you get a seasoned and prepared rotisserie chicken.  Taste of their chicken rivals some of the top notch fine dining restaurants out there. Trust me.  (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=QN7x6WC505-ZoDT4ptVHig&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ)\n\nOverall, I have to say that I'm a fan. If I'm ever back out here, I'm sure that my meals will be centered around the foods that I can't get in California or Las Vegas. But if I'm looking for something good, more traditional, and just want a change of pace from NOLA's Southern type dishes, Zea Rotisserie is on my list.\n\n\n\nYELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (034/366)", "date": "2014-02-09 05:40:19"}, {"_key": "100305", "_id": "reviews/100305", "_rev": "_fM1zFKa--G", "review_id": "qeSHhpoI3A09Si32IqQnSw", "user_id": "4nBxbkpw2_X2rYb26rU23Q", "business_id": "zQPHrply2yeB1EGNnoS66A", "stars": 5, "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "We loved this place!

In regards to mediums I am not an avid believer nor am I disbeliever but open to the possibility.

I tried various avenues, one more \"gimmicky\" shop on a main street,  a man on the street very late at night and then this place. I was going to give up after spending money on the two previous readings of what felt like the most expensive fortune cookie of my life (except this is worse bc I didn't even get a sweet cookie at the end for my cryptic message) however the energy when you walk into the store is different.  It's clearer and more positive in here. The staff in general are knowledgeable and friendly. There are many mediums thay specialize in different types of of readings that are able to assist here. If you want someone that specializes in a certain thing you can call ahead and ask when someone will be on the schedule. My astrological reading was told to me by Alexandria and she went through all the different houses and areas of my life as interpreted by the cards that came up, she also took time in areas that I had specific questions on. At the end of this reading,  she informed me of the stone/gem that would help harness and heal as related to me and my reading.  She also showed me oil that harnesses the different chakras. She wrote down reading material and websites to research relevant to my issues. Alexandria is truly knowledgeable, empathetic,  and genuine. She did give me clarity in the issues that I had questions on and this is money well spent. I neglected to mention that their prices are very reasonable.  Alexandria does readings and chakra work remotely if you call her and I think I will be giving her a call all the the way from California to check in from time to time and do more work. \n\nIf you have a serious question in your heart and are looking to speak with someone for guidanceof a different kind, to assist with working towards healing and personal enrichment this place is definitely worth checking out.", "date": "2014-05-31 00:41:33"}, {"_key": "100381", "_id": "reviews/100381", "_rev": "_fM1zFKi--W", "review_id": "VZycRsNZ_oeYt5b3Q7up7A", "user_id": "b5g34tFE8F-rY9nTw_WgnQ", "business_id": "0yElmJZHbfRJt4gmdot8Og", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I can't speak for any other time of day but the Sunday breakfast buffet is fantastic.

I guess you should ask yourself if you prefer form over function. I love gelato, but it seems Tucson tried it before and it just didn't work out.

He was very pleasant and helpful and explained the concept and made some recommendations. We went with the Dan Dan noodles, Seafood Soup, Fried Rice, a fish dish and a lamb dish. I would describe the food as Chinese comfort food. The taste was pretty good on most of the dishes but as some other reviewers pointed it, everything seemed a bit oily. The Dan Dan noodles had a nice flavor but were especially oily, most likely due to sesame and peanuts. The seafood soup was flavorful but lacking seafood. The lamb was a disappointment. I get it that this is a Schezuan restaurant, and a bit spicy is the M.O., but the lamb was so over seasoned with spices and chili, it  became an indistinguishable meat. I enjoy spicy food but this was over the top. I am wondering if the cook just got careless with the chili as it was late? The other thing that we found was lacking was Han Dynasty's use  of vegetables. There were none really in any of our dishes.

The service and food quality can be top notch.\n\nOrdering take out is another experience altogether.\n\nSure ordering for pickup automatically excludes us from getting a level of service that is often expected from a Montecito restaurant but we didn't realize that ordering takeout also meant that we would be subject to huge swings of food quality/consistency. After all isn't food quality the one thing that a restaurant can exhibit huge amounts of control over?\n\nThe latest takeout experience involved ordering Garganelli with chicken and mushrooms. One order excluded the chicken and the other order assumed that we would enjoy having the chicken added as an after thought - on top of the dish as if it were an over easy egg. We have pictures of the incredibly appetizing meal (being facetious of course) but there doesn't appear to be a way to post those while writing this review. Keep in mind the cost of the meal is the same for takeout or dine in.  The same price applies even when no chicken or mushrooms are added.\n\nOur advice - don't order takeout at Tre Lune.  If you are in pinch and find yourself looking over the menu, then place your order and clear your calendar just in case you need to stick around the restaurant while your dish is being remade the correct way.\n\nPS.

Oh my gosh, I'm SO happy I did! After being turned down by so many other shops, I was afraid that this one might turn me away too- but my fianc\u00e9 and I were in there for literally 18 minutes, and not only was everyone incredibly sweet, but Mo told us that the resizing would be fairly simple, explained the process and answered our questions, and told us that he could have the ring ready in two days. TWO DAYS! (Everywhere else we visited said that it would take 2+ weeks to do the same thing!) We picked up the ring today, and I am just SO impressed. Not only did he do the resizing, but he polished and cleaned the ring without us asking, and I've never seen the ring shine so bright. Thank you guys SO, so much for such a wonderful, worry-free experience!

Dinner comes with bread, butter, tomato, onion, pickle, choice of German potatoes salad or Cole slaw and two types of horseradish sauce. We shared and took half a fish home.

They asked me to pay .51 cents because the gluten free cakes are more expensive.  I gave her the money and then said, \"Wait, what?  I thought it was free.\"  She's all, \"Well, it's a little more expensive to make.  We're just trying to cover our costs.  Is that ok?\"  I said, \"No.  It's not OK.  The email didn't say you can have anything but the gluten free or that the gluten free would cost 51 cents.  It just said free.  Is paying 51 cents free?\"  She said, \"Well, no.  It's not.\"  I think I said something about how its not even truly gluten free because of cross-contamination and using the same equipment to make everything.  She then said, \"Would you like your money back?\"  I said \"Yes, I would.\"  Now, I also could have asked for a receipt and probably taken them to small claims court for false advertising.  If you think I'm being cheap, ask yourself how cheap it is for them to advertise FREE and then ask for money.  Now, a lawyer most likely won't touch a minor lawsuit, but it's important for them to follow the law.  False advertising is false advertising whether the amount is 51 cents of 51 million cents.  I didn't enjoy my cake nearly as much as I would have if it weren't for this.  I know most people would just go along with it and have a little bad feeling and go it's just 51 cents, why argue.

Such a cleverly named restaurant. Have you seen their brand/logo design? Amaze balls (buy a t-shirt!). I've hit up Pho King a few times by now (good spot when you want something quick and easy before hitting up Rexall Place) but this was the first time I've been to their newly renovated digs. Everything is much cleaner and aesthetically pleasing. The right hand side of the resto now consists of a counter instead of seating area.\n\nA and I stopped in for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon. The place was reasonably busy with several tables full along with a few people popping in to pick up takeout orders. The menu is extensive with your typical Vietnamese offerings but they hilariously have a full page dedicated to Western foods/breakfast meals. Random but it must cater to the clientele in the area???\n\nI'll never understand why so many other Viet/Asian places in town do this. Take a page from Pho Tau Bay's playbook and focus on one thing and do it well. Bonus, they're open everyday of the week (Sunday's now!).\n\n- Bun bo hue (P18) ($10.95 king) - I went with their bun bo hue because I've never had it here before. The broth was fragrant with a good depth and flavour profile. I found it to be a bit on the lighter/cleaner side if that makes any sense. The meat balls were delicious! A little bit of green onions and sliced onions gives their bowls an extra zip of flavour. Good stuff.\n- Grilled lemongrass chicken with kimchi (R23) ($13.95) - A was having some trouble deciding but eventually went with the grilled lemongrass chicken skewers over rice with a side of kimchi and vegetables. The lemongrass chicken had an odd texture to it that I can't even put in writing. It was cooked fine but it must have been the cut of meat that they were using. She only ate one skewer and I ended up taking the rest as leftovers. As for the kimchi, it wasn't very good -  kind of flavourless and a chore to eat. Blah. This is why I rarely, if ever, veer from ordering pho at Vietnamese spots.\n\nOn a previous trip, I went with a buddy before an Oilers game where we each ordered pho:\n- Seafood noodle soup (P17) ($10.95 regular) - a couple shrimps, kabuki, and shrimp balls. The broth was great - flavourful and clean tasting! Sort of sate style but with just a bit of spiciness to it. Definitely would get this again.\n- Rare steak and meatball beef noodle soup (P8) ($8.95 regular) - my buddy went to town on his bowl. There was nothing left after we finished devouring both of our bowls.\n\nSolid spot to grab a bowl of pho. Prices are reasonable and service is fast. Slightly ghetto area of town but that's part of it's charm. Don't let that hold you back from trying out Pho King.", "date": "2015-10-26 15:38:26"}, {"_key": "100621", "_id": "reviews/100621", "_rev": "_fM1zFLG--B", "review_id": "B7cYMgN3CBweI2wvfl2Z5g", "user_id": "bQUHcm-woK4VmHybC04Zjw", "business_id": "tP6tk-M8y09QKIoOO0JIbw", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This restaurant was recently purchased & used to be the Sloppy Pelican.

I was excited as well as scared, honestly I had never heard of this mysterious sandwich that so many people seemed to dis. \n\nI went with an open mind and low expectations. I was trying to decide what to order the chicken, the beef, the shrimp, so I just went and got the mac daddy of Saint Paul, the special! I was nervous, what if I didn't like it what if I feel betrayed by Tracey and never trust her again, then I realized I paid like $2.80 for it and would probably not feel bad about tossing it if it was gross.\n\nIt finally came out with the crab Rangoon I ordered and was all nestled in its paper rapper. I slowly opened it and was taken back by the shear ugliness of the Pattie, it was a little like a deep-fried cow pie, I know rite you are like Jeremy please stop now. But I threw my fear to the wind and smothered that bad boy with Sweet and sour sauce and took a big steamy bite. At first I was shocked that I wasn't spitting it out, I mean people were talking about how gross this thing was but I was really enjoying the salty sweet taste and then I hit the monster shrimp hiding inside and was like OK this is one bad ass sandwich. I felt like high fiving someone but I was to busy high fiving the saint Paul with both hands into my mouth. OK so that's my story on the saint Paul, I would most definitely go back for another but need to find someplace closer.\n\nI also ordered a combination plate to take home for lunch the next day of General Tso's chicken but tried a bite while I was there and it was pretty much inedible. When they brought it to me, the chicken was so crunchy that I could barely chew it. I ended up letting it marinade till lunch the next day and it was Delicious. But I doubt most people are doing this so yeah one star for too crunchy of chicken bits.\n\nOther than that I think everything was pretty decent, but I seriously told the lady at the counter to stock Black Cherry Vess from now on, seriously this is St. Louis!\n\nThanks Tracey W.

And again, and again!\n\nMy better half(or three fourths?) ordered the Trail Ensalada(salad). Unfortunately it was missing the pumpkin seeds as described in the menu. Otherwise a nice salad, although a little light on the full-feeling factor. She was satisfied, but felt a wee bit wishing she could have sampled some of my taco! What a beautiful woman will do to maintain her girlish figure! (I love you to the highest elevation and back, Honey!)\n\nOur fourth climber, er, party member ordered the Del Rey Burrito with shredded beef. This thing was the size of a gold bar you might find ensconced into the steep hillsides below the mesa. She advised it was a perfect blend of taste and temptation! I was surprised she was able to eat almost the entire burrito! Throw caution to the wind!\n\nThe atmospheric conditions within the plateau(the atmosphere in the restaurant) are reminiscent of a lot of Mexican restaurants, but with a feeling of quality and no kitsch. This is certainly a higher end establishment and it shows in the quality of ingredients and food fare. Most days, at dinner hours, expect quite a line-up of eager, hungry patrons at the door. They do have some comfortable waiting seating for a few lucky folks. \n\nNow for a nice, warm and fuzzy human moment....\nOnce we were seated, I noticed a charming young family seated next to us. Handsome guy with a beautiful wife and three of the most adorable little girls this side of the Rio Grande. Sometimes you can feel 'goodness' and 'love' within a room, and I certainly felt this effect emanating from this family. I was moved to step over and tell them my feelings. They were very appreciative and receptive. They gave details on how fortunate they were, and that their littlest cutie was their 'Miracle Baby'. A great feeling and reaffirmation that this world still has a LOT of good, decent people in it! There were some nice goodbyes when they left, I felt as though I had known them for years!\n\nMuch to our surprise, when we finished our meals, our server Joe appeared with a platter of some decadent looking mountain of light brown goodness topped with whipped cream! This was the 'Fried Ice Cream' - chunky monkey rolled in corn flakes, flash fried, topped with Mexican chocolate sauce and whipped cream. He announced that this loving family asked for and paid for us to be able to enjoy this treat! We were all very taken and moved. It was a crazily delicious and dangerous treat to our tastebuds! So very thankful to them, where and whom ever you are!\n\nOverall, our climb to the Red Mesa summit was a complete success! We did not get to plant our great nation's flag on the peak, however. They would have frowned at us digging into their nice clean flooring.

It is located in a strip-mall near the Meridian Technology Center in Carmel, Indiana. It is easy to locate with plentiful parking around back. They have the options of outdoor seating, indoor seating near a very large sliding glass window (if you're lucky enough to get one of the few tables near it), or regular indoor seating. The atmosphere is excellent and feels very open thanks to the the floor-to-ceiling windows wrapping around most of the dining area. It really helps brighten the mood inside.\n\nService was excellent which was to be expected since we went during off-peak hours. I ordered the three lil' pigs which I enjoyed, though a bit dry. I chose the brewery fries as my side, though I hear their coleslaw is excellent. The fries were fries, nothing spectacular to be mentioned about them.\n\nI settled on their famous Wheat Ale to drink with my meal. My fiance ordered the Champagne Velvet. Both have very low IBU's which is perfect because neither of us are hopheads. If you haven't had the Wheat Ale before, even if you are a hophead, you must try it. It has excellent flavor for a low IBU beer.\n\nOn our next visit we are hoping to try their line of lambics. Having recently discovered Lindemans Framboise and really enjoying it, we are hoping their lambics capture a similar flavor profile.\n\nOverall I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to sit and have a drink with friends, or just to have a good drink with dinner.

Sloane had an attractive car (2008 Avalon) on Auto Trader so I submitted an inquiry.  The next morning I spoke with Sales Representative Frank Straface as follow-up and he could not have been more professional and responsive.  I drove out to view the car and was actually excited about it.  I had no previous experience with any Sloane dealership.\n\nThe meeting with Frank went extraordinarily well.  We test drove on two separate routs to evaluate highway as well as local driving characteristics.  We sat down to discuss pricing and my requirements, and again, the conversation was totally professional and conducive to success.  None of the usual uncomfortable negotiating tricks were employed.  Frank just checked with management on a couple of things and we reached a mutually beneficial agreement that met my financial objectives.  Rather than being stressful, the experience was positive, probably the best negotiating experience that I've had at any dealer, handled perfectly by representative Frank.\n\nI then worked with Business Manger Shawn Pecora, who was able to set up an ideal payment schedule while I was depositing money in my account to cover the checks, and I was able to take delivery of the car on the spot.  The dealership was able to accept my rental car return right there, so I arrived in a rental with an expiring agreement and left with my new car.  Shawn again was highly professional and he was able to meet every critical need of mine.\n\nWe noticed early on that the car had some front-end vibration, so I contacted the service dept to have it checked out.  I also wanted to check with Frank for some help because we were only given one key for the car.  Asst. Service Manager Mark Hartsfield got the car into the shop at the exact time promised.  It turns out a small bent rod was found so the service will be performed and I will be given a loaner.  No stress or questions about the repair being covered.  Mark again followed the pattern of the other gentlemen I had worked with-highly professional truly wanting to get the problem resolved.  Then, Frank consulted with management and was able to get us the key we were missing.  No stress, professionally handled.\n\nTo summarize, I approached this dealership as a total stranger with a pressing need, and this team delivered and keeps delivering a level of professional service that meets and exceeds every expectation I had.  Everyone is very comfortable to work with and are in top form.  I would not hesitate to recommend Frank Straface as well as the entire management team at Sloane Malvern.

I used to go to this when I was younger and didn't appreciate BBQ as much.  Now that I live in Vegas and used to go to school in Texas, I'm always on the search for some damn good BBQ ribs.   \nThis year there were 24 BBQ companies.  Wow meat everywhere.  I hit up only a few, but I made sure that the ribs were drenched in sauce....Checkered Pig BBQ (dry and sauce needed some heat), Aussom Aussie Australian BBQ Co  (a bit dry, and just needed more tang and spice in such a sweet sauce), Desperado's BBQ Rib Co (lots of heat and tang, it also offered pickle chips to snack on---i wanted this place to win), and Porky N Beans (a meat dish over rice with too much sauce, so it was very sweet and tangy).   I also washed these down with ice-cold lemonade, and this great tasting Jalapeno Brew from the Great Basin Brewing Co. (you smell nachos, after every sip....it also has heat...i'll be back for this brew)  Finally, I had to get my vegatables, so I bought grilled white corn on the cob drenched with lemon juice and powdered w/pepper and garlic.\nIf you ever make it to the cook-off, I have a few recommendations to make the experience better:  1. Go with a bunch of people b/c there are not too many places to sit down and eat.  2. Leave someone behind while each person goes to each booth to buy a bunch of ribs and drinks to bring it back for a huge feast.  3.  Time..if you're early smaller lines, but hotter in the day..if it's later in the evening, longer lines, but cooler.  4.  Spend a long time there, to digest everything and try everything.    5.  Bring plenty of cash, some places take credit, but it's better to have cash.  6.  If you have money, buy a private table for $800 (share w/a bunch of friends b/c its all you eat and drink).    \nSo if you're craving ribs and you're in Sparks,NV during Labor Day next year, I'll definitely see you there!!!", "date": "2006-09-12 01:38:58"}, {"_key": "100688", "_id": "reviews/100688", "_rev": "_fM1zFLO--I", "review_id": "xN4FkOPHJyYNO53J2kwTDQ", "user_id": "10eeVBAebCLlyzxZ889Jbw", "business_id": "MAIfD4kJDCydgoD1l2b_vw", "stars": 1, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This tasting room was recommended, cool scene but terribly aloof and pretentious.

It's not the best decor I've ever seen but is unique nonetheless.\nThe prices at this place are very affordable. They do have a large menu (apart from a separate lunch menu) that contains everything from empanadas to pasta. The thing I liked about their menu was that they had at least 15 items separately listed on a 'vegetarian' section of the menu. That is always helpful for vegetarians. \nI had ordered a lamb gyro with a side of home-made chips off the lunch menu. The gyro was served on an open pita with a generous dose of Tzatziki sauce (Which I love). The lamb meat was well cooked and the whole dish was quite filling. The only thing I would criticize were the potato chips that were served on the side. They had zero seasoning and hence were bland and some of the chips had lost their crunchiness/crispness, which leads me to believe that they chips are just being held in an open container somewhere in the kitchen.\nOverall, a nice new place to have tried out.

The beef comes from a farm in northern Indiana, the produce from Piazza, the bacon from Smoking Goose, and the bread from a bakery also located in northern Indiana. They certainly make an effort to know exactly where their ingredients are coming from, and servers and hostesses are knowledgeable about these locations. \n\nDuring my stop in Harry and Izzy's this afternoon, I started with a calamari appetizer; often, these are a dime a dozen at fine dining establishments, but Harry and Izzy's made it a very enjoyable starter. The calamari was served with a sweet chili sauce that complimented the dish well. We followed up the starter with a filet slider and a shrimp po-boy slider served with a side of fried green tomatoes. The filet slider was incredible; the meat was tender and flavorful and paired with a tangy sauce with a hint of horseradish (or perhaps I was just smelling the cocktail sauce that was waiting for me). The po-boy slider was just as delicious; the fried shrimp sat on a bed of lettuce and dill tartar and came with a side of the signature cocktail sauce. The blend of creamy tartar and the eye-watering heat of the cocktail sauce was incredible, and to be frank I could have eaten about five more sliders without growing tired. The fried green tomatoes were superb as well.\n\nWe finished with a dessert; I chose the Signature Brownie (which my server informed me was voted the best dessert in Indianapolis). The brownie was topped with a scoop of fantastic vanilla ice cream and a dollop of whipped cream, with a cherry perched on the very top. It was extremely delicious, which leads me to understand why it was voted the best dessert in town.\n\nThe staff at Harry and Izzy's is also great; I met with Kara Biggerstaff, the Guest Services Manager, who explained the ins and outs of Harry and Izzy's and St. Elmo as well as providing excellent recommendations on food and drinks. \n\nIt's no secret why Harry and Izzy's is such an Indy favorite, and I wholeheartedly intend to send my business there in the future.", "date": "2016-02-02 21:09:04"}, {"_key": "100699", "_id": "reviews/100699", "_rev": "_fM1zFLO--T", "review_id": "6xo3fOXdQPR9D7Ag0EUYbg", "user_id": "ISirqOjZ0HRaKJqbIuhGRQ", "business_id": "jxfAi7UDmtbhyPw7ZsfKVw", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Nice little cafe in Media with a solid roster of all the Italian favorites plus a few dishes I've never had before.

I think my perception was always that the target crowd was conference attendees and those conducting business over dinner.   \n\nWell, we were here for a recruiting dinner on a mid-week evening, so I guess we did fit the working dinner part of my assumption!   The restaurant was full, but we were seated right on time for our reservation.   \n\nSince this was my first visit, I had to try the famous shrimp cocktail.  The fresh horseradish definitely makes a fabulous cocktail sauce!  The $17.95 price tag is hefty, but I kind of saw it as an investment in a cultural experience (nice rationalization isn't it?).  I then had a strip steak prepared Izzy style which was really delicious!  The steak was tender, and cooked to a perfect medium rare.    I did appreciate that a side is included with the steaks; one of my pet peeves is paying $50 for a steak and then being charged extra for a potato or some vegetables.    I opted for the saut\u00e9ed green beans which were prepared with red peppers and onions - quite tasty!    \n\nI didn't try any of the desserts since I was in a meat coma from the steak, but it was a good meat coma, so no complaints!   It is very easy to finish with a bill around $100/person for dinner, which is about the same as other high end steak houses.   If you are looking to splurge on a really good steak though, this is a good option.    \n\nService was good, but a little confused at times.

I'd been meaning to stop in for a bite to eat after hearing they opened in Voorhees Town Center, and I'm so glad I made the suggestion.\n\nFirst of all, our waitress Lacey was phenomenal.  There is not often that a server can handle all of the demands from my eclectic family!  There's also not too many times when I learn my server's name and make a note of it in my phone so I'll remember their name later for my review.  She was so helpful with the food, cocktail, and beer menus.  She came to ask us for refills many times and to just check in on the 10 of us.  Lacey knew the menu well and offered suggestions on various items.  Right before our food came out she came over with a huge sampling of all of their different types of beers for us to try on the house! Because she made this extra effort, a few of us switched our drinks to try a pint of one of the samples we liked (nice move Lacey!).  \n\nWe all enjoyed our meals and the dishes ranged from burgers with sweet potato fries to tacos, salads, and appetizers.  They have a huge menu with various tasty options and our party took full advantage of the variety.  Iron Hill even had a section of \"small plates\" on their menu which I really enjoyed because I was having a hard time deciding what to order.  I chose the fried goat cheese (something I'd heard of and have wanted to try) and the pulled pork taco both of which were very flavorful and the perfect size for my appetite.  We ordered 2 nacho appetizers which was plenty of food to start us off.  I would say that one nacho appetizer is good for 4-5 people.\n\nThe best part was that we didn't feel rushed out of the restaurant.  We hadn't seen each other in quite some time and were coming together to honor and plan our grandmother's funeral.  It was nice that we didn't feel that time was up after we finished eating.  Although we were too full for dessert we stayed to have another drink and figure out our plans for the next few days.

My Father recently passed away and is the owner of the Verizon account we have. After some hassle an employee named Julie was able to get me my upgrade to an iPhone 6s and I also ordered a screen cover and case. I didn't appreciate the tacky up sell move for the accessory bundle that came with extra crap you don't actually need.\n\nIt was too bad that my phone was on back order. However, I'm pretty patient, so I didn't mind having to wait to have it shipped to my apartment address. At this point I was going to write Julie a great review for being able to get me a phone despite the difficulties.\n\nHowever, it's extremely unfortunate that Julie is incredibly incompetent and can't enter in a proper address or email for a signature required delivery. I tried calling the store a couple days later to see where my order confirmation was so I could track my order. I called several times with no answer until the evening and had to leave a message for Julie who told me she couldn't email me a receipt. No surprise there.\n\nEventually I called the national support line, who told me it was sent to my mother on our account. She forwarded it to me. This is when I realized Julie had entered my shipping address incorrectly. Unfortunately, she couldn't fix that either and she did not return my call to tell me how she would help to resolve it either. \n\nSince Julie clearly doesn't care about her customer service or owning up to or correcting her mistakes, I spent 3 days making phone calls to FedEx and I finally was able to get my phone after a huge headache of dealing with that.\n\nSo then, I took my new phone and case with cover to the store so I could activate it and have the accessories put on. Of course, Julie has to help me again. \n\nIrritated, I let her activate everything while she continues to not apologize for any inconvenience she caused for her mistakes when I tell her it was a hassle to get my phone--after she asked about it.\n\nOf course, their internet sucks and my iCloud doesn't want to transfer all of my apps, contacts, etc. So after wasting a bunch of time, I leave with most of my contacts on my phone and a screen cover and case placed by Julie herself.\n\nWell about an hour later, I notice a crack in my case and the cover falls off. Furious, I go back the next day. I'm rudely turned away by some man at the door. I then call the national customer service line to explain the situation who tells me they're very sorry that I'm dealing with this terrible experience and I shouldn't be treated this way by a Verizon store. Unfortunately, the national customer service line can't issue me new accessories because my Father is deceased and he is the owner of the account. They told me at this time, I should immediately request to speak to the manager at the store and demand replacements.\n\nSo I went back in and waited patiently for a manager. Over a half hour later, a blonde girl who works there tells me I can't speak with the manager and tells me she's sorry but they try to offer the best service they can and they can't do anything more for me. She also told me I can get a new screen cover because it has a warranty and it's absolutely free. Guess what lady, no it's not, I actually checked.\n\nI was so disgusted I left as quickly as possible. DO NOT waste your time with this store! Verizon needs to learn that there is a HUGE difference between \"trying\" to offer great customer service and actually doing so!\n\nGo to the Apple Store where they actually resolve customer service issues and are trained properly to do their jobs.", "date": "2015-10-26 00:31:50"}, {"_key": "100752", "_id": "reviews/100752", "_rev": "_fM1zFLW--T", "review_id": "BbgldVl4Ti1Hy1UhRB4T7A", "user_id": "eaY9Erh2Ar1IoBmUqPhNLQ", "business_id": "tpbBttkFdD4bKdUvmslspg", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Great people.

We also had scallion pancakes - I would skip these in the future as they were not remarkable. Perfectly respectable, but not as awesome as other stuff. \n\nFor entrees, we mainly ordered form the specialties menu and had the snow pea greens with garlic (delish and fresh!), the Lamb with cumin (excellent, tender, flavorful), crispy beef (featured shredded celery and was my favorite dish), and beef lo mein (for an \"Americanized dish\" - some of the best lo mein I have had). We also ordered the dan dan noodles and they were outstanding. I loved everything and the spice level was a-ok for me, but I love spicy food.

It was noon, the place was packed with business folks and only the hostess was around - no orders were taken, no water glasses filled, etc. When the server did show up - all was well, but it was a good 10-minute wait.

They were the successful way to provide the \"stuff\" of life away from the urban core.  They worked well for almost 50 years.  But, as with most things, they were overdone, and failed to adapt to the changing demographics and cultural evolution that they spawned.  Walk through most malls today and you see lots of empty space, failing stores, and a subculture of youth versus elderly hangouts.  \n\nFirst the malls disrupted Main Street.  Then the Walmarts and Costco's of the world, disrupted the malls.  But, the disassociation from the communities where the consumer lived ultimately started to alienate them.  People wanted to return to their Main Street where possible.  More began to appreciate the quality of city life, and returned to the urban centers to once again live and work in the same place.  The suburbs began to lose its charm for many, especially those without young children.  \n\nThese reurbanified folk did not want to shop in malls along an inhuman highway, and certainly did not want to spend much time in a suburban style mall transplanted in the city.  The developers who thought otherwise, are wishing they had been smarter.  The retail franchisers and chain expanders were the last to catch on, but the growing list of failing stores and malls bear witness to this truth.  \n\nSo it is with the Shops of Freedom Place.  Fundamentally, a suburban marketplace miscast as a modern upscale urban experience that it turned out not enough people really wanted.  A J. Crew in a Center City suburban style mall just does not attract enough customers.  Never will. \n\nIt is not that such a public space could never work.  It can, but it requires a total reconfiguration that demonstrates an understanding of what people really want.  What is that?  A return to the village life, or that of the old neighborhood, where people knew each other, and felt like part of a community - in the city.  More impersonal and monotonous shopping is not where we are headed.  \n\nHow accomplish that?  Start by thinking in human scale.  Change part of the Liberty Place skyscrapers into condos and apartments for people to live.  Add a supermarket, cinema, child care, medical facility, and more greenery throughout the buildings.  Create a vertical village or neighborhood.  Where are the green grocer, the deli, the bakery, the corner tavern? \n\nThe central rotunda can still work as a gathering place for activities, but it should feel more like the gazebo in the middle of the public commons.  \n\nPeople want their cities to be state of the art, cutting edge, and full of energy and opportunity.  But, they also want to feel like it can take care of their needs and make them feel part of it, not overcome by it.  There are examples of this being done successful around the country and the planet.  Visit some of the new cities in Asia, and even some of the new age projects in New York, Seattle(JB) and San Francisco.  \n\nBring it down to human scale, and they will come and thrive.", "date": "2014-07-13 18:53:40"}, {"_key": "100875", "_id": "reviews/100875", "_rev": "_fM1zFLm--U", "review_id": "Lu3_fgV1faPKDDnXXzro0w", "user_id": "tJZnXf1mafOOEcUNd3yoiA", "business_id": "tFpstYqxugKHzeyNUsuD_A", "stars": 4, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Still a very good option for downtown Carmel.

It was a small group (5 people), and we loved it. I had been to New Orleans several times and taken a few of those big-name tours, so I thought I was going to get a lot of redundant information, but we didn't. Not only was the content great, but Jeffrey was a great storyteller and if you had any questions, he had answers. I could tell immediately that he enjoyed his job and actually cared about being a good storyteller, unlinke some other tour guides that I've had who were just going through the motions.\n\nFast forward a year and a half, and then-boyfriend is now my husband, and we were back in New Orleans for our honeymoon! I decided to book us on their bike tour, the cemetary tour, and the ghost tour. All of them were fantastic. And this time, we met Jeffrey's wife, and she gave us the cemetary tour. She's just as good of a storyteller as Jeffrey, and we got to watch her yell at someone who was writing \"XXX\" on Marie Leavau's tomb. (You shouldn't do it, it's disrespectful. And a felony.)\n\nThe bike tour was lots of fun, and we got to see areas of the city close to the French Quarter but a bit beyond walking distance. The ghost tour was interesting, and the only tour of the three this time that had other people on it. Being the night before Halloween, there were more people on the tour than normal - but it was still only a group of 10 people! We were walking by groups of 30ish people, and I can't imagine trying to deal with that many people while trying to jockey for good position to hear the story. Blah! I have no idea how Jeffrey can afford to keep his groups so small, but I'm glad he makes it a priority - it really adds to the enjoyment of the couple hours you'll be spending with him.\n\nIf you're still on the fence....just take one of his damn tours already.

Darling place--decor in black NYC subway print with whimsical pictures of pop art and sayings on walls. We do not speak Mandarin (or any Chinese dialect for that matter), but there were enough people who spoke English to explain what was on the menu to us. \n\nWe ordered clear noodles with sesame sauce--fresh and delicious, with cucumber, carrot, cabbage matchstick style. We ordered without pork, but we saw others order it and it came with little crispy things on top, so if you do pork, it's probably fantastic. The sauce came on the side which I liked, so I could mix it all together in a ratio I liked. \n\nOur server told us they specialize in skewers, so we added an order of beef skewers that were spicy and tender. We were glad we took his advice and will definitely try more next time. The people next to us had steamed bun skewers which looked interesting. \n\nI ordered soft tofu on sizzling plate--the fried tofu in a thin crust came sizzling in a lightly sweet and spicy sauce--the sauce was boiling when it came to the table--with some peas and diced carrots on top. The peas and carrots were hard for me to eat with chop sticks, but I managed fine. Not sure if forks are available or not. \n\nMy son got cumin calamari fried rice (note: calamari is spelled calamay on the menu). I thought it had a strong seafood taste (but I'm not a big seafood fan), but my son enjoyed it. \n\nThings I spied at other tables that I will try:\n--potatoes in sweet sauce--the presentation is lovely with a delicate floss cage surrounding it. \n--eggplant peppers potatoes--smelled great as it went by\n--seasoned fries looked good\n--dried bean curd with jalepenos looks like wide noodles, but are made of bean curd\n--shrimp with hot peppers--not sure what it was called, but with the number of peppers on top of that shrimp, it's bound to be spicy. \n\nGlad there is a new restaurant on Olive that's serving what seems to be authentic food from Northeast China.

We were greeted by the abundance of servers and hosts when we walked in a promptly seated.  A quick review of the menu showed they were reasonably price ($15-$25 per entree on average), and that they had about 100 options for dinner.  We decided to try the chicken parm and the veal piccata as our meals.  Both meals included salads (house or caesar) and they provide you with a warm bread basket while waiting (homemade italian bread and 'tomato pie' included).  Our food all arrived quickly and was cooked well.  For dessert we ordered tiramisu but soon found out they were out of it.  We couldn't decide between the napolean or the canolli so they gave us both and only charged us for one.  Both were good too!\n\nIn short, we had great service, with really good food (flavor and portion) and would recommend others try this out.

That, plus a short bar, plus a corner kitchen area, constitutes the entire restaurant.\n\nIt's quite dark inside, with tabletop candles and Spanish music playing in the background - perfect for a first date, a hundredth date, or drinks with close friends and co-workers. Not, on the other hand, a family-friendly restaurant; I wouldn't recommend bringing any children here.\n\nThe wine list was quite extensive, as I expected it to be, and offered a variety of by-the-glass choices, and just as many by-the-bottle options. I tasted two red wines during my visit: the Ben Marco Malbec, Argentina (hints of blackcurrant and slightly acidic) and the Pasion Brava Tempranillo (Rioja), Spain (much sweeter, very smooth drinking). No matter your wine preference, Tzin has a variety of options to suit every taste, and the excellent service ensures that your wine glass is always topped up.\n\nTzin offers a typical tapas-style menu: a selection of small-ish dishes with a strong foundation in Spanish cuisine. Diners can either select several to share amongst their party, or choose one or two for themselves. Everything (and I mean everything) sounded delicious, so it was difficult to make a decision.\n\nIn the end, I decided to try the Olive Plate to start, since I love pairing marinated olives with wine. Alongside the olives, the plate boasted a selection of focaccia bread, olive tapenade, and a dish of olive oil and balsamic vinegar, all of which were delectable. The warm marinated olives were delicious and went extremely well with my glass of Ben Marco.\n\nFor dinner, we decided to order separate dishes, and opted for the Chorizo and Gnocchi Stew and the Chicken Breast Supreme. The stew, served with grilled flat bread, was absolutely heavenly and had a weighty tomato taste that complemented the manchego gnocchi and chorizo exceptionally well. The chicken breast dish was moist and tender, and was served on a bed of harissa couscous and dried apricots, with a dollop of minted yoghurt. Harissa is a Tunisian hot chili sauce, so the couscous understandably had a bit of a kick to it; if you don't like spicy foods, I'd advise you not to choose this dish. The spiciness isn't overpowering, but it'll set your mouth tingling if you eat enough of the couscous.\n\nWe had excellent service throughout our entire visit - the server was very friendly and accommodating - and enjoyed the chic d\u00e9cor, open-style kitchen, and gigantic wine rack (my next purchase).\n\nOne of the things I like best about Tzin is that they're all about the dining experience. This restaurant is about relaxing, enjoying a good glass of wine, and sampling delicious appetizers and tapas plates. They're a hole-in-the-wall restaurant simply for this reason; if they were to enlarge the space and cram in as many tables as possible, they'd lose much of the charm they get from the currently intimate, personal dining experience. \n\nIf you work downtown, if you enjoy wine and tapas, or, hell...if you live in Edmonton...you need to make a date to visit Tzin sometime soon. As I've said, and as their website stresses, they're a small restaurant, so please make the most of OpenTable and book yourself a place. Then all you need to do is sit back, quaff some wine, nibble on an appetizer, and simply experience.", "date": "2013-10-11 20:52:28"}, {"_key": "100947", "_id": "reviews/100947", "_rev": "_fM1zFLy--H", "review_id": "CWnlYCpwSd51jRIHIZNN7A", "user_id": "IEyuwK6Wtd5ggM-NllOdFA", "business_id": "KEbtz3tpQfGKhDbY634pYw", "stars": 3, "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Come during the week.

I did enjoy the non-charred bits of lobster and my steak, which was succulent, juicy and hiding a hint of sweetness (although a bit more pepper/rub would've been great) whereas SO thoroughly enjoyed his porterhouse (both sides bringing out separate textures, the bone adding in a caramelized tone of flavor)\nOVER his steak- SO took Erica's suggestion and got the truffle butter- definitely made his meal. If you're on the fence, GO FOR IT. You won't be disappointed!\nSIDE DISH: we opted for the creamed spinach which was another excellent suggestion by Erica. Unlike other places where the spinach is too rich that you're feeling icky after the 3rd or 4th bite, Morton's had hints of nutmeg but was made so that you didn't feel too heavy afterwards. Definitely a good accompaniment to our meal\nDESSERT: Thinking we were too full afterwards but unable to say no after Erica wheeled out the sweet choices, SO and I split a carrot cake. Absolutely the right choice! It's rich with carrot shavings on the side, a tall 2 layer separated by cream, made right. SO and I fought for bites and I took it to the next level, washing it down with a Kahlua/coffee.\n\nThe eh:\nLobster bisque- don't get me wrong, it's tasty but felt like it was missing something. I quite like Ed's Chowder House, where each spoonful is almost too rich to stand whereas Morton's tasted almost healthy, lacking in the full-on flavor punch of each bite\n\nAs far as steakhouses go, Morton's definitely delivered, cut of meat, sides and dessert although I'll definitely be passing on the seafood flavors. Can't expect them to be good at everything...just serve their mains well!", "date": "2013-12-11 06:11:52"}, {"_key": "100991", "_id": "reviews/100991", "_rev": "_fM1zFL2--V", "review_id": "FuNsjx8qp2XA3gpW7T-Y1w", "user_id": "igFFCbic4mGJI1_J70eHuA", "business_id": "2brttsiFBlW8070dsPzQDA", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Great as always.

The place is the former Warsaw Cafe location and is super cute on the inside and out.  The service was a bit slow, but the owner/waiter/food runner was extremely friendly.  The restaurant was relatively full but they only had 1 waitress and the owner who functioned as a waiter/food runner.  I heard the owner telling someone that his wife makes all the food and she only makes one dish at a time...which doesn't seem like the best idea.  This may also explain why the food didn't come out piping hot.\n\nAppetizers: Fried tofu- good, but could have been crispier.  Thai papaya salad was pretty good as were the thai basil meatlballs, but I felt like it could have used some kind of dipping sauce or something since they were a bit dry.\n\nEntrees: Pad Thai- super super al dente.  Some of the noodles were basically uncooked and the pad thai was a bit dry.  My friend got the panaeng curry with duck which was actually delicious.  \n\nI will probably give this place another try.

Did I mention the fact that the espresso was literally ON FIRE hot? oh I didn't? well it was. and that made me quite sad. I have always been curious about the good karma up on 22nd, passing it constantly when driving over to see the West Philly folks. I've never had reason to stop because I was always headed somewhere, however, when this one opening up so close to my house, it was clear I could take it in for consideration. \n\nI stopped by on a walk with my dog and bf. They let me bring the dog in- massive props. The space is really lovely. It's got great high ceilings, lots of sitting room, (but all tables and chairs like a cafeteria, no cushy seating) They are open late, which is nice, but still, it's just not quite what I'm looking for. If I leave my house and walk south instead of north, I end up at Chapterhouse, and while GK is certainly nice, I also need my beverage to be on par with the aesthetics of the place, and at least at my first visit, it was not. It burnt my mouth and was 3/4 foam and 1/4 espresso and not a latte in any form of the word. \n\nI'm sure we'll try it again and at that point, I'll give it a second chance and second review, but for right now it would be my last choice for a coffee fix.
