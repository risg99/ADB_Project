Taste-wise, my medium-rare burger with goat cheese and egg is comparable to BBP or 500 Degrees. The meat and egg were prepared the way I like it, and the toppings were of high quality, especially the cheese. (Note that the egg yolk is runny! If you don't like that or are afraid of salmonella, let them know.) The only thing I did not like as much was how heavily the hamburger buns were buttered. That was just a little bit too much for my taste, but I know many people who would love the slightly sweet, buttery bun. However, the burger I got was 16 dollars (11 for the burger, 3.50 for the cheese and 1.50 for the egg), which is exactly the price of the burger at Craigie on Main. In case you don't frequent Boston as much, Craigie's is a 'real' gourmet burger where French fries and a small salad are included in the price. At VW, we had to order French fries for 5 dollars on the side, which were delicious and came with a well-spiced ketchup.\n\nI like the atmosphere of the place, and the location which made seating outside more pleasant than at BBP's right on Walnut Street. The service also was excellent (very much unlike BBP). The staff appears professional, they are attentive and fill up your water very regularly.\n\nAll in all, it's a 3.5 - the good burger, atmosphere and service warrant a high rating, but the extraordinarily high price (for what you get) is rather a downer, and I can't give 4 stars to a place where I am unsure whether I'd want to come back. I do like the concept of letting the customer choose their own toppings, which allowed me to choose a combination of toppings you never see but I personally enjoy. On the other hand, the menu of this place is largely uninspired and boring, which in turn is Bobby's Burger Palace's strongest point. If you are in the area, this is probably the highest quality burger + fries you can get - but it comes at a steep price.", "date": "2012-06-26 18:57:00"}, {"_key": "10051", "_id": "reviews/10051", "_rev": "_fNypmLa---", "review_id": "z07gf4eU9jN9r5n1svqNCw", "user_id": "Qx-5FRNpL14H2TtIKmB1kA", "business_id": "GfqPAxmkQQXFXAJ63aJUiA", "stars": 4, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "Saw \"A Christmas Carol\" a few days ago and loved it.

I can only speak for myself, so first of all, all of our food came out HOT, the buns are made in-house and were delicious.  super tasty, nicely toasted and crispy yet soft - i wanted to take some home with me.  The combination of the goat cheese and bacon with the burger was perfect.  I loved it.  It did not need anything else.  I did put some of the chipotle sauce that came with our fries (separate purchase) and it was pretty good, but not necessary.  Burgers were a pretty good size - they were smaller than the bun, but still a good size.  Worth the price?  Sure, this was a quality burger!  My only gripe, however is that the price did not include fries (see below).\n\nNo one left a morsel on their plates.  My son's friend ate so fast we actually thought he was a little strange...no one should eat that fast...\n\nSides:  We ordered two large french fries ($4 each) to share between four people and it was exactly enough.  You have a choice of \"sauces.\"   I was not impressed at all - they were just fries, and honestly with burgers starting at about $8 these fries should come with the burgers.  I need to have french fries with my burger, so I will pay every time, but suggest that they re-think this item and make them worth the price and at least make something worth the price like  garlic fries.  These are NOT worth the extra $2-$4.\n\nWe also had the Cheese Curds - ok not what I was expecting but it was good.  Not sure what kind of cheese it was but it went really well with the mustard and apples - the bread/crackers however were a nightmare almost funny - they crumbled because they were so thin!  Almost like lace.  They really should be a little thicker.  Again, it was good, but c'mon please be a little more generous with the thickness of the bread/cracker.  \n\nThe boys had ice cream, but I won't comment because I did not taste it.

I have a new favorite restaurant in town and Home Wine Kitchen is IT.  The schiznIT, in fact.\n\nWe celebrated my birthday at HWK last night.  Originally, we tried to get into Farmhaus (my other fave resto in STL) totally last minute and were told we could either dine outside (in 102 degree weather?  Huh-uh.) or come in at 8:30, which didn't jive with our babysitting situation.  So I called HWK, which I've been dying to try since I drove by and spied their sweet space on Manchester.  You people in Maplewood are incredibly lucky to have this restaurant in your midst.  Bow low.\n\nWe were warmly greeted by one of the owners, Josh, and heard about a few revisions to the ever-changing menu.  I like a place that refuses to serve a dish due to sub-par ingredients and yesterday the sardines didn't pass the perfection inspection, so they were nixed from the appetizer menu.  No problem for me as I had my eye on the potted pork appetizer, which was outstanding.  The well-seasoned, unctuous spread contrasted nicely with the crisp grilled bread and paired well with pickled radishes, coarse mustard and red onions.  I had a tiny scoop left when the bread ran out and I had it boxed up so none would go to waste.  No potted pork left behind!\n\nSince it's the perfect time of year for stellar tomatoes and glorious, sugary corn, my husband and I were torn between the sides of creamed corn and heirloom tomatoes.  We asked our server if he thought we might be overdoing it if we ordered both sides in addition to our entrees (since we weren't familiar with HWK's portion sizes) and he suggested we'd do fine with just one side... Buuuuuuut, I said it was BIRTHDAY DINNER and how could we pass up two dishes made up of ingredients so absolutely at their prime?  We couldn't.  We ordered the tomatoes and the corn and the chicken and the wild boar.  Thank goodness.  Thank goodness, not because the portions were tiny (in fact, I'd say they were fairly generous and a really good value), but because the FOOD. WAS. AWESOME.\n\nI couldn't help myself when the little cast iron dish holding the creamed corn made it to the table.  I dove right in to the blessed mix of perfect corn, bacon, green onion and leeks and practically shouted to Justin, \"You have to try this NOW!\"  Part of me wishes I hadn't been so exuberant about it--maybe I wouldn't have had to share so much.  But damn, that was one of the finest side dishes I've ever had the pleasure of eating.  Ever.  I almost wept with joy.\n\nThe heirloom tomatoes, noted as having thyme, honey and balsamic components on the menu, also arrived in a cast iron dish, which surprised us--I think we were expecting a cold, more salad-like dish.  Don't mistake that for disappointment, though, because these tomatoes were also delicious.  Roasted, sweet and juicy, they tasted like the best fresh, chunky tomato soup you can imagine and the bright yellow, orange and red tomatoes just looked cheery.  Does that sound silly?  Probably.  I'm still giddy from this dinner; indulge me here.\n\nJustin had the wild boar shoulder for dinner, flavored with cumin, orange and currants, slow-cooked in wine and served with fragrant basmati rice.  The boar was topped with orange gremolata, if I'm not mistaken--a mixture of garlic, parsley and orange zest--and Justin was just blown away by the flavor combination.  He said it reminded him of a dinner we shared at Rick Bayless' Topolobampo in Chicago, which, if I had to guess, would probably be rated as his #1 dining experience in his 32 years, so this is really high praise for HWK.  It really was delicious.\n\nI had the chicken entree--a perfectly seasoned, crisp skinned, juicy breast and wing accompanied by arugula, bacon and these surprisingly amazing fingerling potatoes.  I was just shocked by how crisp (not burned; crisp) the outsides were and how creamy delicious the insides were.  The arugula gave them a nice nutty taste and the bacon added a nice saltiness to the dish.  I chose wisely.  And I about licked my plate clean.\n\nI was beyond full at this point in the meal and should've passed on dessert, but I was intrigued by the stone fruit dessert with orange cream.  To be fair, I couldn't eat much more of anything at all, but this was the only item of the night I wasn't head over heels in love with.  The fruit was poached, I believe, with some spices, giving it that Christmas-y, mulled wine sort of taste.  I know lots of people who love that, but it's not my favorite.  Maybe I should've tried the goat cheese tart with honey and pistachios, but I thought its richness might totally put me over the edge... Maybe next time. :)\n\nI enjoyed our server, who was knowledgeable, friendly and efficient, and I loved getting to chat with the owners, Josh and Cassie (who is also the chef).  They've done incredible work on the space and made it a unique, intimate place.

I knew he was on Top Chef, but to be honest, as much as I love restaurants and food, I just can't do cooking competition shows.  They are always on at like 10 pm and they just make me hungry and craving crazy foods late at night.  \n\nHowever, I heard many good things about Sbraga and they were offering a Chef's Counter menu of \"tailgate\" foods.  So my husband and I ventured up Broad St to check it out.\n\nLet me pause a minute and explain how Sbraga works.  So they offer a 4 course meal for $49 pp.  Each course has about 8-10 options to choose from.  However...\n\nMonday through Thursday, at 6 pm sharp, they offer a Chef's Counter menu, which is a set menu with a specific theme and is served at a bar that overlooks the kitchen.  Think of it as a sort of dinner theater.  FYI- there is a maximum of 6 people allowed for this seating.  This option has six courses, as well as an amuse bouche for $75 pp.  A bit pricier than the regular menu, but you get to watch the chefs prepare your meal for you AND they explain each dish to you.  For you Top Chef fans, Chef Kevin explains some of the courses as well.  Super cool.  I felt like Padma that night (hey, I've SEEN the show, I just don't watch it regularly.  Cause it makes me hungry)\n\nUpon arriving at 6 pm sharp, I noticed how classy and chic the interior is.  At 6:01, I realized how awesome their service is.  I was ready to give Sbraga 4 stars, but their service puts them over the edge.  They make their guests feel right at home.\n\nSo how was the food?  Here are the courses and my opinion of each:\n\nAmuse:  Meatballs--- I make some pretty good meatballs, but these blow mine away.  I really liked the sauce- sweet and savory at the same time.\n\nFIRST:  Hoagie Dip--- Hoagie Dip usually makes me a little quesy, but Sbraga's was a delightful fluff of deliciousness.  I could have eaten that all night.\n\nSECOND:  Pepperoni and Beer Cheese Soup--- My favorite thing that we had that night.  A soup made of three things I love?  Yes please!!\n\nTHIRD:  Sloppy Jose--- Chef Kevin brings a latin flava to his sloppy joe by using shortrib and chorizo, and covering it in a spicy cole slaw.  Ole!\n\nFOURTH:  Pork Gyro---  I love Greek food and this dish has a homemade tzatziki sauce that was awesome\n\nFIFTH:  Buffalo Chicken--- Surprisingly, my least favorite meal.  The chicken was a little undercooked and the celery-apple-carrot salad missed the mark for me.\n\nSIXTH:  Brownie Sundae--- I thought I couldn't fit anymore food in my stomach.. until this dish came out.  Brownie, covered with ice cream, bananas, strawberries. YUM!\n\nAlso, the bartender, who was an absolute doll, brought us over complimentary spiked hot chocolate with a dollop of white chocolate liquor whipped cream.

To which, my server responded, \"Sure...we have a house roast, dark roast, or a vanilla flavored?\"\n\nAre you kidding me?  A breakfast place with coffee OPTIONS?  And, one of those options is DARK roast?  Color me caffeinated.  I promptly ordered their dark roast which came poured out of a carafe left at the table.  Plus, they have flavored creamer (bonus!).  This was definitely not your usual (awful) diner coffee.  It was dark and delicious.\n\nFortunately, my dining companions were familiar with the menu and HIGHLY recommended the Salmon Eggs Benedict.  Always a fan of anything including hollandaise sauce--I went for it.  My people!  Perfection.  Here's the thing, when you smother something in hollandaise, you can easily be lazy in the preparation of what comes UNDERNEATH the hollandaise.  I mean, it's going to be smothered in all that lovely, buttery deliciousness--who will notice?  I will notice, people.  I will.  And, there was definitely nothing lackadaisical about the preparation of this dish.  The salmon, even without the hollandaise, was moist and flavorful.  The eggs were perfectly, beautifully, delicately poached.  It was the single best Salmon Benedict I've ever consumed (possibly the best Eggs Benedict in general!).  \n\nThe Benedict came with a side of home fried potatoes, which had a light peppery flavor that I quite enjoyed.  The service was spot on--prompt, attentive, and friendly.\n\nOne final note I have is the menu:  The menu is expansive.  If you have family and/or friends in town with diverse tastes--this is a wonderful option for breakfast.  They have all your classic selections covered (bacon & eggs, chicken fried steak, various scrambles).  They have the sweet (pancakes, stuffed french toast, waffles, crepes).  And, they've got your savory (An entire list of various Benedicts, skillets, and classic to creative omelets).

Not only do you get to eat authentic Moroccan cuisine, you get to enjoy a cultural experience as well. \n\nYou may have walked past Marrakesh or the surrounding streets many times without even realizing it was there, like I had prior to this visit. It's nestled on Leithgow Street just a notch off of South Street. Forget South Street or even the rest of Philadelphia for that matter. You are about to step into a different world. To enter you must ring the doorbell on the side door. \n\nI felt more like I was going to a house, than a restaurant; especially with the shower located in the restroom on the second floor. During my entire visit, I never felt like I was at a restaurant. I felt comfortable and relaxed. Maybe eating with your hands with a towel on your lap has that effect. \n\nI found my group of fellow Yelpers in a cozy private room.  The room had four tables with booth seating along the outskirts of the room. Ottoman like chairs took up the rest of the space for the rest of us. With such a large group in not the largest of spaces, it got loud.\n\nOur meal started with customary hand-washing and we were even entertained twice with a belly dancer. After placing our order, the food kept flowing. The service was probably the most unobtrusive service I've ever had. As one dish was placed in front of us, another was seamlessly removed. I felt like royalty or at least someone enjoying a nice meal at someone's dinner party. The regular dining formalities I'm used to were thrown out the window, and it was fantastic! \n\nAs I'm sure you're aware, this $25 prix fixe menu has seven courses and you are welcome to BYOB. While it was a ton of food, I walked in the door absolutely starving and walked out not overly stuffed. I believe most people left absolutely full, so maybe the tip is to come in extremely hungry. Here's a little rundown of dining experience:\n\nCourse 1: Three-Salad Platter- The eggplant is phenomenal (and messy). Luckily you have some assistance from the pita to eat it. The cucumbers and bell peppers and carrots and cucumber were good, but the eggplant stole the show. \n\nCourse 2: The B'stella- As someone who doesn't normally love sweets but loves cinnamon, carbs and meat, this dish was a winner. This dish was dough filled with chicken, nuts, almonds, egg, peppers and onions. It was really hot at first, but once you cracked open the shell and let it cool down, it was easier to eat. I had some pita saved from the first course, so I found it easy to break off a piece and rest it on the pita while it cooled down. Truly a sweet-savory delight. \n\nCourse 3: Chicken- So here's where the choices began. You can either get chicken with lemon or spicy chicken. My group opted to get the spicy chicken with the cumin sauce on the side. The chicken was melt in your hands and then melt in your mouth good. The spicy sauce had a nice kick without being overly spicy to me. I still had some pita leftover so I did a little dipping with the sauce. \n\nCourse 4: Beef or Lamb- My table got a little creative here and asked for half portions of both the beef and lamb. The beef was served shish kebab style, and to be honest, not my favorite. It was a little well done, and I struggled a little to get it off the stick resulting in a pepper flying into my husband's wine glass. Sauvignon blanc tastes best with a little pepper anyways, right? The lamb was perfect. Even the non-lamb eaters thought it was delicious. It was tender and took on the flavor of the chick peas and onions without having an overwhelming lamb flavor. \n\nCourse 5: Couscous with veggies, chick peas and raisins- This was probably my least favorite dish from the main meal. It was a little blander than other couscous dishes I've tried in the past. I would have been disappointed if this was the only thing I ordered, but everything was a hit thus far in the evening. They did give us spoons at this point, so don't worry about eating the little grains with your hands.\n\nCourses 6 & 7: Dessert- I'm assuming the tea, fruit and pastries count as the sixth and seventh courses. At this point in the evening, my bottle of wine had been consumed and I wasn't counting the dishes, and am making this assumption while referencing the menu. I'm not a tea fan so I passed. The pastries were little crisp triangles that reminded me of baklava. The fruit came out frozen was a little hard to eat. I nibbled on a strawberry and took a banana for the road since the majority of the group passed on the fruit. Perhaps the fruit was customary, but I thought a little unnecessary. If it's part of the traditional meal then no harm, no foul.  \n\nTo sum it up, I had delicious food and hours of fun. It's an experience not to be missed in Philadelphia, especially if you go with an adventurous group of friends. While I couldn't imagine going to Marrakesh every Friday night, I can definitely pick a handful of occasions that would be a perfect fit.", "date": "2015-07-28 15:31:21"}, {"_key": "11531", "_id": "reviews/11531", "_rev": "_fNypmNu--Y", "review_id": "mZzfH9Rlan0EzIv23uy5Zw", "user_id": "CaVEy7kpASLwNBGymLwhgw", "business_id": "KP5OncF2jhT7_J1phHPPww", "stars": 3, "useful": 6, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "text": "This review is based off of one visit as I don't think I will be returning anytime soon. \n\nI was attending a Christmas get together at Besito with a large group of about 16. I ordered a \"frozen\" margarita. It was the only frozen margarita on the menu and was pomegranate. It was okay, but a little off for my tastes. It was also melted and no longer frozen within a few minutes of it arriving. I only finished about half of it. We ordered during happy hour when the margarita is supposed to be $5 instead of the usual $9. We had to ask for the happy hour price, but more on that in a moment. \n\nThree of us decided to split a queso fundito. This is one of my favorite Mexican Appetizers and I order it regularly at traditional Mexican restaurants. While the queso fundito was still good at Besito, it was disappointing to someone that has had a traditional version. It is supposed to be essentially a fondue type pot of melted cheese with some chorizo and served with tortillas. Besito cheapened theirs by adding piles of onions and peppers. It was also served in a very shallow square skillet. When split three ways (and with the 2-3 others in the room that tried it), it left very little queso fundito. The flavor was good. However, with the added thick peppers and onions and the small quantity, I would not order again. \n\nI was able to try the chips, salsa and table side guacamole also. I will say that this is probably the best guacamole that I have ever tried. I loved the flavor and the thick chunks of avocado. The salsa and guac were my favorite things at Besito. However, I can't see myself paying $10 for guac on a return visit. That is just way too much for guacamole in my opinion. \n\nFor my meal, I ordered the Chile Rellenos Con Hongos. I order Rellenos anytime I see them on the menu since they are one of my favorite things. Most restaurants serve them with some rice and beans or some sort of side. Let's face it...stuffed relleno peppers are not the most filling thing in the world. My Rellenos did not come with a side. The came with sauce and nothing else for a whopping $18. I almost didn't order them when I saw the price, but everything else on the menu was that price or higher. The Rellenos had good flavor for the first bite...or maybe two. However, a few bites in I was over it. They are stuffed in goat cheese and there are globs of goat cheese on the outside. So much freaking goat cheese. I like the stuff, but it was overboard. That wasn't the worst part though, it was the pine nuts. There seemed to be a whole bag of the things mixed into my small plate. I would never order this again. \n\nOur service was great until it came time for the checks. Our waitress did not give us happy hour prices for the margaritas we ordered before happy hour was up. She also messed up dividing our appetizer between the three checks. However, the worst was that we handed the checks to them with our cards in each individual envelope. When they returned, my card was with my friends check (and had been charged) and my check was missing. WTH? It ended up taking us about 45 minutes to get our checks, get them corrected, get them corrected again and get out of there. My poor husband had dropped me off and was waiting outside this whole time since I thought I was almost done when I received the check. Uggg. \n\nI don't think I will be back to Besito anytime soon. If I do, it will be for happy hour only.

Next thing to know is that they don't disguise their meat by chopping it up into fine little bits. This is sliced baby, and it is good.

You can park for free at Nissan Stadium (formerly known as LP Field)  and walk across the Pedestrian bridge (10 min walk) right to the arena.  And you have the bright lights of Broadway where the arena is on.  So before the game or after the game, you have a surplus of sports bars, live music venues and barbeque joints to check out before, during or around the game.  IT WORKS!  All what I have said is before talking about the arena itself.  I'm sure the concerts here are great.   The hockey games here is a great watch.  Seats are decent but getting in and out, the concourse, the food venues..all good with me.\n\nGrade: A++", "date": "2017-01-15 17:32:33"}, {"_key": "11665", "_id": "reviews/11665", "_rev": "_fNypmN6--g", "review_id": "9-KQUXge9MkBUuRW4Vs79Q", "user_id": "ySqKXdWrWSsMk9hHAORlSA", "business_id": "gGyqnAlpFrka_qzpO7j4lQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I cannot say enough wonderful things about this place.

The Banana Foster's French Toast is unbelievable. I loved everything about it. The toast is very soft and sweet. The banana cream inside and the Banana Foster sauce on top are incredible. They are sure to satisfy any sweet tooth. I devoured the entire dish quickly. I rank the dish as one of four French Toast dishes that are above all others. I do not even want to rank them 1, 2, 3, 4. Instead, I will rank them 1, 1a, 1b, 1c:\n\nTop 4 French Toasts:\n\n1. Blue Moon Caf\u00e9 in Baltimore (1621 Aliceanna St, Baltimore, MD 21231): The Cap'N Crunch French Toast tops my list. Grinding cereal and using it to create a crunchy crust is genius. I also enjoy the fresh fruit on top.\n\n2. Blu Jam Caf\u00e9 (7371 Melrose Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90046): The Crunchy French Toast features a cornflake crust. It also has berries on top. I slightly like the Cap'N Crunch French Toast better because I enjoy the Cap'N Crunch crust a little more.\n\n3. Surrey Caf\u00e9 and Juice Bar: The Banana Foster's French Toast is on par with both. I give the other two the thinnest of margins because I love the cereal crust. Nevertheless, the banana cream and Banana Foster sauce is an equalizer.\n\nI also ordered a side of home fries. The potatoes had excellent seasoning and a nice crunchy skin. In addition, Surrey is a juice bar. I had a fresh squeezed orange juice. Is a large, 16 ounce juice really worth $6.50? Personally, I would not normally pay for it. However, I wanted to try a fresh juice since I saw great reviews for them. It was very good. Nevertheless, it is a lot more than I would want to pay for juice. I got to Surrey at 8 AM when it opens. The place is great so the seating will fill up quickly. On a Sunday, it was almost full by the time I left at 9 AM.\n\n4. Stanley Restaurant :Surrey's Caf\u00e9 and Juice Bar have a slight edge with the toast and Fosters sauce. However, Stanley's additional toppings (bananas, banana chips, and vanilla ice cream) and beautiful presentation is an equalizer.\n\nIf you are visiting New Orleans and looking for recommendations, please see If you are visiting New Orleans and looking for recommendations, feel free to message me through Yelp and I can share my itinerary, which includes my Yelp reviews.

The place is SUPER tiny, so be prepared for that.  This isn't your standard Italian place by any stretch.  There are only roughly 12 tables here, which I'm sure undoubtedly ensures the highest quality food coming out in a timely manner.  The wait staff were pretty darn good.  They worked more as a team as the 3 person squad were all constantly at our table either delivering food or checking up on how we were doing.  We never had to ask for more water and were helpful and choosing a perfect menu for us.\n\nWe decided to go with 2 orders of the antipasto and an order of the shrimp/beans appetizer.  The antipasto was AMAZING, almost everything on it was unique and flavorful.  My girlfriend was obsessed with the fresh arugula.  I loved the roasted red peppers, frittada and asparagus.  The shrimp were expertly cooked and seasoned and pretty much unlike any shrimp you get at a restaurant.  Well worth it in my opinion.\n\nFor our entree we decided to get 3 small portions of different pastas on the menu.  We went with the spinach gnocchi, tagliatelli al limone with the bottarga cheese and the pesto trapanese.  All were extremely unique.  I've never had spinach gnocchi quite like this and was such an awesome experience.  The tagliatelli was super fresh and the limone sauce was divine.  I loved the pesto dish and the crushed pistachio on top complimented the pesto so well.\n\nThey are also pretty liberal with their bread here, so order away!  The tomato pie focaccia was amazing.  The other bread was on par as well.\n\nWe ended our night with some zeppolies.  They were warm and fresh.  The nutella sauce was a great modern twist.  A perfect ending to a perfect meal.\n\nThe place can be a bit on the high side, but I think it's totally worth it.  This is coming from someone who would merely be happy with 2 for $20 at Chilis.\n\nOn an ending note, with the place being so super cramped it can get a wee bit loud.

For what they seemingly lack in a way of app and entree selection they more than make up for with the quality, care, and innovation of their offerings.\n\nI landed after a long day of travel, famished. My lovely host, Brit S, picked me up from the airport, and after situating myself at the Conrad, we hopped the whole two blocks over to the Libertine.\n\n(It should be noted that former Indy CM Jon A also highly suggested checking this place out.)\n\nThe space is long and lean, with a formidable bar set-up and bottles for days behind the bar. Bitters and fruit and tinctures and all that, you know the drill at this point. The \"kitchen\" is also behind the bar, and the whole thing is grey and low light and trees/antlers and candlelight and warm and really nice smells. It sort of reminded me of a less formal Hinterland (located in MKE). Employees rock the whole Stumptown coffee look, but they're not nearly as in yr face with it as Stumptown is.\n\nOh, yeah. I was telling a mildly entertaining story with linear progression, wasn't I? \n\nSo: I was *famished,* and wanted nothing more than to start w/ one of their amazing cocktails, but knew I needed to put something in that stomach of mine first.\n\nSo... to the eats.\n\n1. A beet salad starter which Brit and I shared. Goat cheese and spinach and beets and yup, you guessed it. So so good, as beet salads can be when they're done right. Then?\n\n2. A chanterelle mushroom & fresh vegetable pot pie. Oh my god, I can't even. I love chanterelles, I love pot pies (secret favorite thing), so... you get the idea. Clearly handmade with fresh ingredients, I couldn't stop eating it. It was effing delicious. I was full, and yet, I kept eating. So so good.\n\nThe rest of the bites on the menu were on that whole gastro tip with an emphasis on the more foodie-focused. (God, I still hate the word foodie. I really do.) What I mean? I don't remember seeing offal or brains, but along those lines for sure. Marrow, elk, etc.\n\nAnyways, moving on (and this is important).

I was already heading to TN to visit some family so my mom & I decided to use the Groupon the night before I left so we'd be close to the airport.  We had both been to the hotel in the past (prior to the flood) and thought it was so gorgeous & we couldn't wait to actually stay here & see what the room would look like.  According to their website we were in for a real treat in our room but when we arrived that wasn't the case at all.  \n\nFirst off, their parking has gone up & is now $18 per night to park in a lot that doesn't shuttle you & your luggage to the main hotel, you have to walk.  If you choose to valet the cost is $24 per night which I have a huge issue with...the parking is outside in their own lot, this is not a major city like NYC where parking is limited so I feel that charging people to park & walk is a bit ridiculous, I can see charging $5/10 for valet but charging me to park my own car & shlep my own bags is a slap in the face especially considering the room rates.  How are locals supposed to be patrons to the businesses inside if they have to pay that much just to park?  \n\nThe hotel itself if gorgeous but the room was pretty boring...it was a large single room with a 4 person dining table & 2 armchairs, it was not at all what was explained on their website which indicated \"Our suites include a moderate-size living room and optional connecting bedrooms with endless possibilities for entertaining or for small corporate meetings\".  This led me to believe that we wouldn't be sleeping in the moderate sized living room & have no bedroom at all.  At no time during booking or check in was I asked how many beds I wanted & since I thought our suite had bedroom(s) I didn't ask & when we got to the room we had 1 king.  I called down to the front desk first to ask why we were put in a standard room & why it only had 1 bed & I was told \"our Jr. suite is just 1 large room & you should have specified when asked how many beds you wanted\" I replied \"I was never asked during booking or check in what I wanted\" I was then told \"well, if you want to change to 2 beds I can transfer you to the front desk & you can see if they have anything available\" and I said \"no, I don't want the hassle I guess we can just share the bed\" and was told \"OK, sorry you are disappointed\".  The guest services person didn't offer to find out the 2 bed availability for me, she didn't offer to move us to a garden view room (which is still cheaper at its standard rate than the discounted rate we paid for the suite) or offer any other solutions either & I was really disappointed with that.\n\nOnce we got over the disappointment of our room we got dressed & hit the hotel to shop, eat, cocktail & check out the murals & water shows.  First off we tried to find the water show & weren't having any luck so we proceeded to shop & asked the woman working in one of the stores where we could find them & she said \"oh, they aren't running tonight\" so that was disappointing but we moved on to exploring the murals when we were then asked by a lovely gentleman to leave because of an event that was going on behind the closed doors of the area we were in.  After a couple hours of being at the hotel we were 0 for 4 so we decided to start drinking...we hit up Fuse & each had 1 drink & our bill was $19 so we moved on to dinner at Jack Daniels which was so good & reasonable priced.  I think our total bill was under $40 & we didn't have any drinks but we did have leftovers!!  After dinner there was nothing left to do so we went back to the room for some shut eye which was great until we got the luxury of listening to our neighbors have sex.  After all of that I took an Ambien & slept really well until about  7 am when I could hear people talking in the hallway & room doors closing one after the other.  My mom said she slept for s**t because of all of the noise & it was a shame too because the bed was so comfortable.  \n\nI'm sure that if everything we wanted to see & do would have been available to us this wouldn't have seemed like such a let down & the boring room wouldn't have been that big of a deal but considering that we weren't able to do anything that was on our list I would be hesitant to stay here again unless we had an atrium room so we could at least sit on the balcony & people watch.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, the lush greenery & the beautiful architecture as well as the shopping & food are all amazing but as a guest I left feeling pretty let down.", "date": "2012-03-01 21:23:50"}, {"_key": "12189", "_id": "reviews/12189", "_rev": "_fNypmO6--K", "review_id": "igkqGaCcCUqjltD7ffFhhg", "user_id": "bIYVW14atDaygbDaIDWcvQ", "business_id": "pfCgNGJgKAX68auH7Aw4YQ", "stars": 4, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "I like this Sam's Club because it is in an excellent location and has great prices ranging from Gas, Liquor, Food, and Electronics, Tires etc etc. Their warranties are also great and are not difficult to take advantage of when you need it.

This time, I ordered the Highland Black Mocha Stout from Asheville, NC which went down ever-so smoothly. It was quite frankly like drinking velvet.

So, let me explain this magnificent paragon of culinary achievement: perfectly crunchy sweet potato waffle fries hugged by dollops of pulled pork, all smothered with a carolina mustard bbq and kissed by a few diced green onions. Talk about food that hits every tastebud high note: savory, sweet, sour, and (with a kick of hot sauce from your table) just a bit spicy. I suggest saving the entire plate for yourself because you will not be inclined to share. Trust me, this dish inspires selfishness in us all. While I have tried the Five Alarm Burger, I admit that what truly sticks out is the Caroline Sweets dish due to satisfaction alone. Bar none.\n\nBecause we did come in such a large party, I do believe the waitstaff struggled to handle the numbers. Beers were delivered late or could not be ordered due to busyness, orders were forgotten or delivered to the wrong people. Common mishaps considering the huge party that we made up. However, the quality of my food and beer were still spot on, despite my beer gazing at me from afar (for far too long). \n\nI would suggest the Charlotte location if you are looking for a less busy location, but this one is fun since it has a lovely beer garden in the back.

We found a warm bustling place with a nice Saturday night feel and some decent barbecue.  Hendricks offers most meat choices that you would expect; both St Louis style and back ribs, pulled pork, brisket, turkey and sausage (what no goat? Oh well.)  Hendricks has a seriously large menu, obviously centered around barbecue, but the weirdo in your party could find something else to eat.\n\nWe had a great waiter, Aaron.  He was well informed ( I was impressed that he actually knew the definition of St Louis style spare ribs) and when we each ordered a Pick 2 platter, he informed us that each couple could split The Whole Shebang for the same price and actually get to sample all six meats for the same price, so that is what we did.  Apparently it is a default to serve the meat without sauce, which \"meats\" with my approval.  There are four sauces on the table.  Each of these trays of meat comes with four sides; so Ms T and I had two slaws, greens and sweet potato fries.  The D's added cheddar grits, sweet potato casserole, green beans and baked beans.  So here we go from first to worst.\n\nHendricks makes good ribs.  Both the St Louis style and the back ribs were smoky, moist, tender and nicely seasoned with rub.  The rub is the same on all meats and has a slight sweetness.  If it were over-applied, it would be too sweet, but it was in the proper proportion.  I would order these ribs any time and to me there is really no significant reason to choose one over the other.\n\nNext for me was the pulled pork.  I am not a fan of pulled pork in Missouri.  Often it is in large hunks and dry.  This was pulled to bite size and was moist, but not wet.  I would recommend this for a sandwich and it would be my second choice after the ribs.\n\nThe brisket was surprisingly good for this neck of the woods.  It had a good balance of smoke bark and beefy flavor.  It was nice and tender, but was on the edge of dry.  This would also make a good sandwich, but might require some mayo to lube it up.  I know this can vary a lot from brisket to brisket.  This is also worth ordering but at least this one night, was not quite as good as PM in Chesterfield  Valley.  Still pretty good for Missouri.\n\nTurkey breast and sausage bring up the rear and I would not re-order them.  Turkey is always a real gamble.  If it is not overdone and you get to eat it as it is sliced, before any juices run out, it can be magnificent, as we experienced at Black's Barbecue in Texas.  This had pretty mild smoke and was fairly dry.  It was not sawdust though and you could make a sandwich with plenty of mayo that would be credible.  I just would not order it again, though on another night it might be fine.  \n\nThe sausage was, hmmmm.  I almost liked it.  It was not like Hillshire Farms (a point in its favor).  It had some nice heat, Ms T and the D's found it too spicy but it is not really.  I like the locally made jalapeno and plain sausages in Texas.  They can be sensational.  My issue with this was that it tasted like Pine Sol.  This is either carelessness at the butcher shop with disinfectant or it has a spice in it resulting in that flavor.  Is it juniper berries?  A-1 Steak Sauce kind of has the Pine Sol thing going, maybe they are basting it with that or it is in the mix.  Whatever, all I can think of is \"the Power of Pine Sol, Baby\" when eating it.  I'll pass on that next time.\n\nSides - Ms D declared the green beans to be just a little better than plain out of the can.  (try some at Alcenia's in Memphis) They loved the sweet potato casserole, likening it to dessert.  They liked the cheesy grits and the baked beans.  I did not sample them.  Aaron warned me off the baked beans due to onion.  \n\nThe only think Aaron was not accurate on was the slaw.  He thought it had no onion, but that was all I could taste.  This is very finely ground (not shredded) slaw in the style that you get on dogs and burgers in Carolina.  It is unique, but inedible.  This was one of those rare times when we left the slaw.  It is unspeakably bad.  The sweet potato fries were fine.  The collard greens with bacon were good.  They were cooked well enough and seasoned with meat.  I enjoyed them.  There are even more sides to try.\n\nHendricks was worth the drive on a winter night.  I think we need to meet our St Charles friends, the L's there.  So go, have some ribs, maybe a pulled pork and brisket sandwich.  You will want to bring your own slaw.  I'm going to be generous and go four stars on the strength of the ribs.", "date": "2013-02-23 14:58:27"}, {"_key": "12663", "_id": "reviews/12663", "_rev": "_fNypmPm--E", "review_id": "ytbsSxliaypLx-_Y7goGwQ", "user_id": "v98WXw1EToiuPIxtE0aekQ", "business_id": "Wr2k0Vz8RbcumYulp-jIrA", "stars": 3, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "It's more of a solid 3.5 stars.  This was our first time at the jersey location.  It was very spacious, clean, and empty.

We started with scallion pancakes, meh i've had better.  It was nothing special.  The guy had the spicy beef noodle soup, beef was braised as well.  The broth was delicious and spiciness level was a 5.  When he asked the waiter if the size was comparable to pho the waiter did not have a clue to what pho was.  You work in an asian resto my dude!  Granted this is not a viet joint, but you should be well rounded about asian cuisine overall.  Anyway, the dan dan noodle is a staple when dining at Han's, the spiciness level was a 6 and they accommodated me by not adding meat to it.  I also ordered the spicy cucumber, spiciness level was a 6.  After one helping i was over it.  The garlic overpowered the rest of the flavosr as i kept munching on it.  My eyes locked in on the salt and pepper shrimp entree so i had to order it.  I love this dish.  The minced pepper and onion just heightens the flavor of the shrimp.  Shame that it was on the pricey side, $19.95.  I think there were only about 10 pieces of shrimps.  The guy had a chicken entree that he liked, nothing special.

I remember the eye candy who served my drinks more than what I had.  Gorgeous girls behind the bar and in the cocktail area.  When we were ushered to our table, we finally checked out the menu and saw at least 40 things we wanted to try, so we thought it over while snacking on olive loaf and sourdough bread - both amazing.\n\nFor starters, we ordered the warm spinach salad (I think it was served with pate?) with poached egg.  It was to die for -- perfect amount of egginess, great presentation all around.  I ordered the lobster roll (lobster roll with a hint of lavender!!) on house-made brioche, which came with chips and some other cute little lobster-tentacle-esque garnish.  I seriously housed this lobster roll, and hoarded it so that my husband couldn't have any.  Happy Valentine's day, baby.  F-ign unreal.\n\nMain course... My husband ordered the salmon, which was poached in olive oil and probably the single best piece of salmon I've ever eaten.  I was SO JELLY over his order.  I had the flatbread with arugula and truffle oil (see earlier reference in part one of this food novella), and a side of broccoli, which somehow was the best broccoli I've ever eaten.  Someone obviously crushed pretty hard on the broc while they were making it, because it was unreal and just so delicate... Yes, I just reviewed a side of broccoli. For realsies.\n\nDessert (yeah, we went there) was beignets, and this crazed garbanzo bean cookie topped with poached pears and honey ice cream.  Our server brought out some delicious honey-related (I say related because I don't know if it was infused or how it got there) cognac to pair it with.  I had one of those \"food moments\" where I was like... You know what?

I stopped in on a few occasions during my week long visit to NOLA (only to their Mag St. location). Each time I visited the line was somewhat longer than what I had hoped. Although, the line went by very quickly. I waited 15 minutes or so tops on a super busy day. I can't really complain there. A few people in my party made a comment about how they should have a separate \"donut to-go\" window for people just wanting to get a quick donut or two to go. What a brilliant idea!\n\nPer their name, they obviously serve items other than donuts. They have breakfast items (about 5 or 6 to choose from) till 11am. At 11am they begin serving lunch items - sliders and tacos. I am a huge fan of biscuits and saw that they make their own there. I had to try one of their breakfast biscuits. I opted to just try a scrambled egg and cheese biscuit sandwich. Holy cow it was delicious. Really hit the spot. \n\nI never got the opportunity to come back for their lunch items but I had heard from friends that their sliders are delicious! After seeing photos of them though, I had wished they were served on something other than little hamburger buns. Not too much excitement there if you ask me. I'd much rather have it on a biscuit.\n\nAnyways, back to the donuts. They offer about 12 or so different donut flavors each day. They have their standard glazed, cinnamon sugar, iced donuts each day. Those are accompanied by different and interesting flavored (and sometimes filled) donuts. Check out their Instagram page to see what they are serving each day. It is a bit addicting logging onto instagram and checking their menus each day - I just wanted to go everyday and try all of them. My wallet would be so mad at me. Being the huge bacon lover that I am, I had been waiting to see their maple bacon donut show up on the menu.. my last day in NOLA, it finally did. I was pumped! It was delicious, fresh, flavorful, and savory. The bacon was honestly pretty good by itself.\n\nI tried two of their drinks as well. The Sproca-Cola and their Arnold Palmer. Sproca-cola was interesting to say the least. I was glad I tried it - but don't think I will get it again. The Arnold Palmer was also pretty decent. My ratio of tea to lemonade was a bit off though - too much lemonade.\n\nThe establishment as a whole appeared clean and organized.

For whatever reason, I like to grow my hair out as big and as untidy as possible.  My thick locks are wavy and what many would classify as \"unkempt\" when allowed to grow freely.  Not to say that my hair is dirty because I do wash it every day, but I just like the way my hair looks and feels when it is a booming mop.\n\nThere are other factors in life that when coupled with my lion's mane develop issues that need to be dealt with.  For one- I work at a financial institution, and as much as I would love to say that the world has developed into an open-minded, physical-appearances-don't-matter type of place (where everyone holds hands, endlessly sings lovable Cat Stevens songs, and skips along in unison), the reality is you all are a bunch of judgmental 'yotches who for some reason DO care about how my hair looks and think that it somehow makes me incapable of doing my job...\n\nWell, maybe not *you*...  But definitely you there!\n\nThis \"feature\" of society (the part about judging a book by its cover) is multiplied 10-fold by the simple fact that I come from the Midwest.  OK- Chicago is cool and contemporary and all, but it still is the Midwest folks!\n\nOr maybe I am the one that is delusional?  Maybe I just look rank with my wildin' out, big ass hair?  After all, it is my beautiful and fashionable wife who delicately reminds me a few times a year that my hair is, after all, something that needs care and styling, or at least a good hacking to.  Probably more care than the fine ladies at Hair Cuttery are capable (or more likely WILLING) of giving.\n\nWhich brings me to Dapper.  A friend of mine was raving about the job that these ladies do.  I pride myself in being quite open-minded, but was surprised to hear that it was a \"full-blown\" barber shop run by some tattooed punk rock ladies, ala roller derby style.  Where they offer complimentary beer and pool games while you wait for a chair to open up.  This alone wasn't enough to shock me, but the fact that it came from this particular friend.  What I mean to say is that if there was anyone in the world that I would guess did not give a crap about where he got his hair cut, it would be him.  He has had the same hair cut for over 15 years- military style.\n\nSo why go here, a hip place, clearly catered to those that are looking to pay a lot for a good haircut in a unique setting?  He then tells me because a cut is only going to cost $15.\n\nTo start the trip off, my hair was beyond the point where my wife was going to tolerate it much further.  I was at the \"wing\" stage, where the hair around my ear begins to uncontrollably flip up and look as if I did it on purpose with a hot curling iron or something (childhood evidence: http://static1.px.yelp.com/photo/YaQT9rb_q7LgQRD5Lhg8AQ/l ).  \n\nWinter in Chicago was coming!  I needed natural ear muffs!\n\nAs you can imagine- this \"excuse\" only goes so far.\n\nSo in I go, with wife in tow (I'm a poet and didn't even know it!).  We arrived only a short while before closing and I timidly asked if it was cool for me to still get a cut.  \"Of course!\" was the response, \"have a seat over there, help yourself to whatever is in the fridge and someone will be right with you!\"\n\nHoping that they would turn me away for coming in too late, or without an appointment or whatever, I walked my shaggy self over to a couch and waited, stroking my long locks one last time before losing them (and about 5 pounds- my hair gets huge).\n\nI was shortly called over by Jo, a fellow Illinoisan (is that what we are supposed to call ourselves?) by upbringing, who called me over and asked what I wanted.  \"I need a haircut, but don't really want one.\"  After figuring out why I didn't want one (and agreeing with me, probably more out of kindness and empathy) she let me know I would be in good hands and that she would make things right.\n\nHair washed, and she goes into cutting.  Old-school style.  The way I remember getting it as a kid.  Nothing but scissors and straight razor.  No clippers (which I usually ask for a #3) with my cut.  And yet she got my noggin looking sharp, but still with some length and good shape.  Wings gone, or more like trimmed back, or tucked in or something.\n\nI don't know how to describe the cut- but it looked really good!  Especially after the initial shock of losing my beloved, over-sized helmet, and realizing that I COULD in fact get my hair cut short and still have it look pretty good- and not have to spend a ton of money to do so!\n\nAnd as for Jo- AWESOME.  She kept the conversation going and was into some really cool stuff!  I walked out with some weight off of my shoulders (figuratively and literally), and money left in my pocket.  Not to mention a very happy wife, who happened to start her night of drinking off the right way with a complimentary beer from that fridge.\n\nThanks Jo!  Wish you all were up here in Chicago...

It could have been eating ridiculous amounts of wings weekly in high school, or dating someone whose father grows sick nasty chiles where this inner beast of spicy came from. Yats completes me. \n\nMy all time favorite dishes at Yats are the Spinach-Mushroom \u00c9touff\u00e9e and the Chicken Creole. I try to try everything, because with a rotating menu, there are special dishes that are prepared only once in a blue moon, such as the Thai Curry Chicken \u00c9touff\u00e9e or Chili Cheese \u00c9touff\u00e9e with Chicken instead of the staple crawfish. \n\nEvery meal at Yats comes complete with two slice of French bread with a super special butter. There are many choices in hot sauces, so pick your poison wisely. I like the Louisiana Lightning Strike and Cajun Power sauce (in the squirt bottle) to drench my Yats in the almighty power of spice.

Coated avocados, deep fried, nice outer crunch, creamy middle, served with a grilled lime and a special ranch sauce... trickle some lime juice on the avocado and dip it in the ranch... omg good.\n\nShishito peppers: guess that's the new fad...basically roasted peppers... not as exciting as it may sound. The little sesame dip that came with it brought  most of the flavor for this dish. Lots of peppers though. \n\nChilaquilles: seemed to be a nacho type creation with lots of chicken and cheese.

It's still down a dark alley off of South Street and in a house (the owners' house) Things have slightly changed- Marrakesh is still dim, and served as a 5-course eat-with-your-hands dinner family style, (as if in Morocco)  surrounded by tons of Middle Eastern decor- runs, lamps, the works. The servers are the owners- a couple who loves to keep it traditional. \n\nI called ahead for seating at 8pm but it seems as though we could have just walked in- we ate upstairs.  You have to ring the bell to get in. We came on Sunday but it was relatively busy- downstairs was full but upstairs not so much. Maybe it was because we were upstairs...but I felt service lacked a bit (we had to ask for water a few times, etc but I couldn't hold it against the one server- the wife). On Fri and Sat, there are belly dancers. \n\nIf you're new to this kind of thing, they do a good job explaining the process. First, they ran your hands through soapy water from their majestic-looking teapot. Next, they explain the menu and ask you to choose between 1 or 2 course for dishes 3 and 4. You don't have a lot of flexibility.. so I am not sure how vegetarians would fare. \n\nWe ate:\n\n1) Course 1- three salads: picked carrots, cucumbers and an eggplant puree- like a babaganoush. This was very tender, salty and good- the others were not as fancy but very tasty. A large tangine looking thing comes around for you to grab pita. The pita is ok- it's not warm, it's not fluffy but you can't win them all (and it's important not to fill up too much on this)\n\n2) Course 2- Very interesting kind of Moroccan...quiche? It's basically a flaky pastry topped with confectioner's sugar that houses egg, chicken, nuts...and some other things. It was overwhelmingly eggy, but tasty. Not my favorite dish but had to give it points for creativity and uniqueness.  The flaky dough was delish- very similar to that of the Green Spinach Pie.\n\n3) Course 3- was our choice between two chicken (chicken with lemon olive oil or spicy cumin)- of course we did spicy cumin! It was fall right off the bone- so tender as I'm sure it was slow cooked for hours. It's also half a chicken so you get the breast, thigh and wing. The sauce was not too spicy, I thought, but the cumin flavor is smoky and present. The sauce is pretty slathered across the meat- and yes you can refill up on pita if you're not into eating meat solo. \n\n4) Course 4- is a choice between beef or lamb and since I don't do red meat, I passed on this. My bf ordered the lamb though and said it was very tender and yummy- and sweet. It was topped with almonds and something else that made it sweet. \n\n5) Course 5- Dessert!  You get fresh fruit and baklava (one piece each). Usually I think baklava is too sweet for me but this one was pretty good- and not too oily. I mean, yes, it was very oily but it wasn't like...drenched in oil. It was pretty flat, cripsy and full of that nutty goodness that you make baklava. Bf said it wasn't nutty enough for him. Again, the flaky dough wins. \n\nThe fresh fruit was also a plus- except our apple was bruised so we didn't eat that. We took our orange for breakfast the next day. There were two strawberries (not really regional, ha) and giant seedless grapes that were almost frozen because it the fruit platter came with a chunk of ice. This was almost like a cornucopia..they really do make you feel like emperor and empress haha!\n\nThe meal is well paced (slow) so you have time to breathe.  They sell only a few house wines by the glass; otherwise you get it by the bottle (there are a few varieties at $30 ish, as well as liquor and the like). My bf got two glasses of red wine- the burgandy. It was actually fruity and full of body, which was a plus. I ordered the traditional rose drink which I actually wouldn't recommend- it was really, really sweet. It was like rose syrup (sweet enough), with sugar and water..it was too sweet and at $5, I was upset I couldn't finish it. \n\nThis place accepts cash only and is $25 per person.

I think this was because we ate so early on a Sat evening (5:30pm reservations). We were seated on the West side and the sun was setting. Fortunately I had my sunglasses with me although they did offer to pull down the shades for me as well. The views were definitely lovely but it likely would have been better had we gone later in the evening when the lights of the city were coming alive. \n\nService was excellent throughout the entire meal. Our waitress took good care of my wife who is gluten free. We asked her what a few of the roads/bridges were that we were looking at, but she sort of guessed at it. You would thinking working there they would be required to know the more major landmarks out there. Oh well.\n\nAs for the food, that's what left me disappointed. I started with the Steakhouse Salad. I guess I just assumed there would be some meat in it, but sadly, there was none to be found. There were quite a few olives in there and unfortunately I'm not an olive fan, so ultimately I wasn't able to finish the salad. My wife's roasted shrimp though wasn't bad. For our entrees, she went with the Salmon while I had the Filet and Shortrib Duo. In the end, it was pretty good but it certainly didn't wow me or anything. I've had better meals and other restaurants in the city. At least the evening ended on a more positive note with dessert. My Lemon Tart was delicious and you can tell they have a pastry chef on site.

A few days ago I read Jackie W.'s review of SLNPC and I knew that we would have to give this place a try.  Fast forward to a lazy Sunday afternoon with both of us hungry and craving some pizza.  SLNPC is literally 5 blocks from our house, so it was a no brainer to give this place a try.  \n\nWe walk in and the place is empty, but it had only been open about 10 minutes so I didn't let that deter us.  We had our choice of seats and were quickly helped by Zack.  As we were already quite hungry and not wanting to wait for a pizza to be made, we just grabbed some slices.  I opted to go simple and just go with the peperoni like my son.  Six minutes later I was staring two large New York style pieces of pizza in the face.  Big B delivered our pizza and when I asked for a knife to cut my son's pizza up he quickly offered to take it back and cut it up for me.  That was really cool, as anyone who has tried to cut a giant piece of pizza into bite size pieces with a plastic knife knows is no easy task.  \n\nNow, on to the pizza.  It was delicious, I inhaled both of my giant pieces and my five year old son pretty much ate all of his piece.  He left about 3 bites and the crust.  I was completely full, but very satisfied.  To follow in tradition, I folded my slice in half and was please to see the bottom of the slice cooked perfectly.   \n\nZack was kind enough to offer my son a Popsicle which made him very happy.  Prices were pretty good for a per slice deal.  The prices on their signature pizzas were reasonable as well.  Next time I venture into this place I will have to try the Big Baller as Jackie W.'s description of it still makes me very hungry.    This visit ended with two big thumbs and two pint sized thumbs way up for Big B and his people at the SLNPC.

Pollo a la brasa.... Rotisserie chicken.... Whatever you wanna call it.... I call it a technique done here with love and pride. Lets be clear, you will find no comparison coming from your grocer deli section or at the checkout isle.\n\nWhy do I think this chicken have some TLC put into it? On biting down of this chicken you can note seasoning flavors down to the bone. This is an inclination that prior to even getting into the rotisserie oven, these birds spend some time in some form of marinating process. Building flavor, the chicken also has a seasoning rub all over the skin.\n\nLets go to this rotisserie oven. Another unique element is this oven has a charcoal or grill like component. This gives the chicken a smoky element in the flavor build. As these birds turn in this oven, they keep moist from the natural drippings dropping from bird to bird as they rotate through this oven. In turn, this a reason why some people may note some pieces the skin end up dry and crispy and others get moist or soggy skin on their chicken In the end, you end up with this tender, smoky, well seasoned, fall off the bone goodness. Wait.... how can they add more flavor? Cuenelli's serves it with two dipping sauces, a chimichurri  which gives a herbaceous and slightly spicy flavor, and an aioli which has a garlicky - lemony element.\n\nRound out this meal with some solid sides. Must haves for me would be the cilantro rice. Another herbaceous addition that works well with this meal. I got to use the word herbaceous a few times in this review, it has reflects such great imagery for food talk:) Must have beans with rice no? I pick the spicy pinto beans over the black beans at this establishment but lets be clear these beans are pretty spicy. I also love the maduros here. These sweet plantatains are cooked to perfection where the outsides has this caramelization from the natural sugar of the sweet plantain, leaving you with this toffee-like, stick to your tooth exterior and soft and sweet interior. \n\nWash all down with Inca cola or a bottle of chicha limena.  Inca cola is almost like a cola champagne or a cream soda type of drink. Chicha Limena I say is Christmas in a bottle. This juice has a floral base blended with cinnamon and cloves.\n\nThough Cuenelli's Peruvian Style Rotisserie Chicken have many other notable Latin dishes, the one thing that comes to mind to me is this chicken made with love.

Big portions at decent prices. You won't leave hungry!\n\nAnd now for a full review:\n\nI have been to this Fellini's Cafe and the one in Bryn Mawr several times and each time I've visited there have been some memorable moments...and there have been speed bumps that keep this place from reaching its full potential.\n\nOn my latest visit this past Friday night, I made reservations for 730. My beautiful wife and I arrived right at 730. Although there were two vacant tables available, it took them at least 10 minutes or so to seat us. And when they did, they broke up a table for 6 instead of putting us at the 2 seater. Odd.\n\nBeing out and away from the kids for a few hours, we wanted at least a little bit of privacy, instead of sitting next to (pretty much connected to) a table of four. We asked the manager if we could be moved to the 2 seater...he said fine. Another 5-10 minutes (too long!) later a member of the wait staff came and, without any indication as to his intentions, whisked up our bottle of wine and silverware and ran off to the other table. Not a problem, but some eye contact and a simple 'follow me please' with even a hint of a smile would have been lovely. We shrugged and just rolled with it.\n\nThe interior is quaint, and the lighting is dim. It's a nice place for a romantic meal. But it is LOUD. So loud I would say this place is kid friendly despite being in such close quarters with your neighbors. Not sure if we'd ever try taking our four kids there (actually I'm certain we won't) but one or two can be done without much trouble.\n\nOur waitress was extremely polite and offered the energy and enthusiasm that our other friend lacked.\n\nFor dinner, we ordered a caesar salad to share and for our main courses my wife opted for her usual tagliatelli with mushroom cream sauce and i had what i always have, the tortellini pasticiatti.\n\nComplimentary with the meal were two pieces of bruschetta (very nice) and a small loaf of crusty Italian bread, which is served with butter packets (which perhaps only I find strange for an Italian restaurant?). \n\nOverall the food was delicious, except for a few somewhat minor hiccups: \n\n1. The caesar salad was served on a warm plate. The salad was excellent and would have been legendary had it been served on a chilled (or at least not warm!) plate.\n\n2. I am pretty sure they used frozen peas in the tortellini dish, which is fine with me as long as you make sure the peas are thawed before you serve it! Only a few peas were not quite thawed, but it marred what was otherwise a perfectly crafted masterpiece of a dish.\n\nWhen we paid, the manager allowed us to use an expired gift card. That was a very nice gesture and one that required no push from us to induce.\n\nAll in all, I'll keep visiting Fellini because it's relatively inexpensive and they do most everything well.", "date": "2012-07-16 17:27:36"}, {"_key": "4473", "_id": "reviews/4473", "_rev": "_fNypmSu--K", "review_id": "m6EMoIqkLWn01UrqVOI2yA", "user_id": "86Fgk1s0tAVioJtVnJeBHg", "business_id": "W4ZEKkva9HpAdZG88juwyQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "If you're looking for a great brunch place in New Orleans, definitely come here!\n\nMy boyfriend and I had brunch here on Sunday, and we loved it!

We came prepared with reservations, but the restaurant actually began quieting out while our delicious meal was ramping up; the tables offer more elbow room than the photographs online belie.  As the name of the evening suggests, no menu is in play here; you'll let your friendly server know if you have any food allergies or particular preferences, and before long watch your customized meal unfold.  That's a three-course meal, $30, plus $12 for three half-glass wine pairings.\n\nAs starters, we were served lamb meatballs -- likely the favorite of the night -- and goat cheese-stuffed poblano peppers.  The peppers had a good bit of spice offset by the chalkiness of the goat cheese, making an excellent pairing for my Soave (white wine).  The mains were a corvina fish delicately cooked in wax paper and a swordfish steak served over asparagus with homegrown tomatoes and \"love sauce.\"  The corvina came out on the rarer side, perhaps a little too complex for this Midwesterner's palate, but the hearty swordfish was some of the best seafood I've tasted in Missouri.  Dessert comprised a champagne gelatin and a chocolate tart, both of which were topped by fluffy homemade whipped cream and quickly eaten.\n\nThe staff at Home Wine Kitchen made our visit pleasant, acting casual yet professional during our meal.  The restaurant patrons seemed to be largely industry types that oohed and aahed about the cuisine (perhaps a trifle self-importantly, but this Yelper is no saint himself).  I was surprised to note that other diners were served the same courses as we were (albeit in different configurations), when I was under the assumption there would be a little more variation; however, I can only imagine the challenge such an endeavor would pose to the talented kitchen.  The interior, lighting, and volume here were all very good.\n\nBy the end of the evening, we realized that putting yourself in the hands of the chef is not for the faint of heart, as evidenced by one conversation near us during the meal that all but stopped when a beautiful whole fish was served to the table.  Leaving the restaurant, I was glad that I had tried No Menu Monday, but did wonder what the meal would have been like had I ordered off the menu.

Seriously, it's been in limbo since the spring time. What took so long? I guess, as the saying goes, you have to wait for the good things in life.\n\nAnyways, we had a little reunion with one of my buddies from out of town and went to check out Lee House's latest digs. The place was pretty packed for a Wednesday evening and is split into two different areas, the left side more compact with smaller tables while the right side is for bigger groups of families and friends. The restaurant has a very spacious, open air feeling and they clearly put a lot of time and effort into making things look great. I was hoping that they would put more of their focus on Korean BBQ, as Edmonton is seriously lacking a good place. We shall see, I'm sure things will change when they finish renovating their original Whyte Ave shop.\n\nWhile we were waiting for my buddy to show up, we perused the menu which has quite the variety of options. We decided to try several of their BBQ options but sadly, we didn't even get to grill any meat. Sad face. Also, I have to mention service was pretty weak, even for an Asian restaurant. We could barely hear when the waitress told us what our dishes were, had to ask for tea several times, and it was hard to flag down someone to take our order. I'm sure it will get better once they settle in.\n\nWe ordered:\n- Banchan and rice bowls - the banchan were all good, especially the bean sprouts and spinach. I just wish they brought out more/re-filled them during our meal.\n- Bibimbap ($10.95) - steamed rice topped with vegetables (carrots, spinach, zucchini, daikon, bean sprouts) over a lightly fried egg.  They brought out the Korean chili paste in a separate bottle, so you can add as much as you want. The bibimbap was decent but nothing to write home about. \n- Jap chae bokeum ($11.95) - potato noodles with mixed vegetables, black fungus mushroom in a sweet soy mushroom sauce. This dish was perfectly done! Noodles had the perfect chew. I think I just love noodles. Someone teach me how to make this at home.\n- Bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced beef marinated in a sweet soy garlic sesame sauce. \n- Spicy pork loin bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced pork loin marinated in a sweet onion, garlic chili paste. Slightly spicy, full of flavour, this was my favourite bulgogi dish of the night.\n- Sweet ginger pork bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced pork loin marinated in a sweet ginger sesame soy. I didn't get too much ginger flavour from this one, but it was still quite tasty.\n\nSo to sum up, first visit (of what I'm sure will be many) was pretty good. Lots of interesting items to lure you back. We'll have to make sure next time we try out their other BBQ items and do some grilling!

I finally went with, Birthday Cake. It was a rich creamy vanilla with pieces of chocolate cake and swirls of chocolate icing and bright colored sprinkles.

The convention center area itself is huge, with gorgeous carpeting, interior decor, etc. all around. There are frequently events and meetings at the convention center, so it's always pretty busy.

This in itself just amazes me. There are winding paths (nothing super strenuous), waterfalls, and beautiful greenery and flowers everywhere. There are quite a few shops and restaurants all around the hotel, but the pricing is pretty expensive (I will give a shoutout to Stax though -- a delicious make-your-own burger place).

This means you've got two options, AutoNation or Crown. Based upon personal experience (this happened to both my brother and husband), if you head to AutoNation first, you'll probably find yourself purchasing from Crown. Here's why. \n\nFrom Service to Sales, They're There to Help.\nIronically, I was helping Mom clean her three-year-old CRV interior. Her New York-dealership lease was up in two months (she moved here two years ago and needed to find a new trusted Honda dealership). Once the interior seats were clean, we were ready to hit the car wash. Boom. The three-year old battery died leaving us stuck in my driveway.\n\nHonda roadside assistance towed the car to the dealership - at no charge of course. Crown offered to replace the battery for free allowing her time to think about her next move. Regardless, I was confident we'd roll out in a new Honda, but didn't want her to worry. She's dealt with Michelle and Brooks in service several times and knows they're both awesome, so having had positive experiences with them helped.\n\nNo Real Pressure. No Real Up-Sell.\nKaren handled our lease deal with management assistance from Vinny. She listened and understood that Mom, a senior, is far from tech savvy - bells and whistles scare her. Mom no longer deals with ice and snow - no need for four-wheel drive and needs to feel comfortable on the road. Her previously-leased 2012 Civic was too tight and too low to the ground. With all of this in mind, they set her up with a standard-feature H-RV crossover vehicle to reach her price point, style and comfort requirements. \n\nJustin Simplifies the Finance Process\nYou've found your ideal car thanks to Sales, now it's time to pay up. Oy, the stress, right? No. Justin puts you at ease with humor, warmth, and banter knowing the stress involved in coughing up the cash. When we told tell him Mom obviously didn't need a top-of-the line coverage plan on a leased car, but only trusts the dealership for service, he worked with her...\n\nReady to Rock and Roll\nRegardless of the dealership closing in thirty minutes, Karen sat with us in Mom's new H-RV and walked her through each and every feature. From actually setting up and testing her iPhone speed dial numbers via bluetooth, to setting up her quick-find favorite soft rock radio stations - every question was answered. I've had this with Volkswagen, but Mom said she's never experienced that with Honda. \n\nOverall Positive Customer Experience \nWe left feeling great about the purchase. We liked getting to know the staffs' personal background - where they're from, details about their families, etc. Enjoyed complimentary cups of tea, coffee, cocoa, and bottled water - car shopping is serious business. We were there for four hours - keeping hydrated is key. Another reviewer said they make you feel like family and honestly, they did. \n\nSweet Sidenote\nCrown apparently loves animals. While out on the lot, we had the pleasure of meeting Oliver, a local orange and white outdoor-cat. Though his owner lives near the dealership, Oliver's made Crown his second home and the crew doesn't seem to mind sharing the outdoor space with him one bit.

So what does that mean? Well, if you're like me.. that means when you are visiting the area and looking for awesome take-out, you just order from both places so you don't miss out! We ordered take-out from V Street, then headed next door to Wiz Kid, where I ordered the WK philly (the vegan version of a classic philly cheese steak). We were originally planning on taking this to our hotel to eat the meals from both restaurants but we decided to snag a table at Wiz Kid and eat our food there. The WK philly was ready under 10 minutes, and we self sat in a cute little table where we indulged in all the vegan goodies. I loved that they had regular ketchup and spicy ketchup as options. I went with the spicy and my mom had the regular. We split the hoagie and were both BLOWN away by the flavor. This was the best cheese steak I've ever had. The bun was so tasty, the \"meat\" tasted like real meat but BETTER because I didn't feel disgusting and overly full after I ate it due to the meat sweats and that gross greasy meat feeling in your tum.

It's going to largely be bar cuisine but I find it quite delightful.  I go here not when I'm in the mood for something healthy (though the Paleo Bowl would fulfill that if  you are looking for something healthy) I go here when I went delicious bar food.\n\nIf you like regular nachos, the kind with real melted cheese (not fake cheese sauce), these are some of the best you can get.  They're nothing crazy, no unique twist, just damn good nachos.  If you want fancier nachos, try elsewhere.  But here is going to be one of your best options for straight up regular delicious nachos.  The half portion is more than sufficient for one person.  I cannot even imagine trying to tackle the full portion. I'm a vegetarian so I never get it with beef, but you can totally add a meat option should you wish.\n\nAlso delicious is their mac and cheese.  It's so cheesy, never dried out, and always has some nice cheese melted right on top.  You can get it as a side with many of their burgers, or you can order the entr\u00e9e sized.  And in my opinion, you can never go wrong by adding green chiles to the mac and cheese.  Because green chilis are a gift.\n\nI love their caprese appetizer as well.  Standard mozzarella, tomato, basil, balsamic.  But it's always tasty.  Same with the mozzarella sticks.  Their white bean hummus plate is also delicious.\n\nThe other thing I love about trident is they do what, in my opinion, all restaurants with burgers should do, they say at the top you can take any burger and substitute a veggie patty.  It's baffling to me how many places don't even offer a veggie burger at all (they're frozen!  not that hard to keep them stocked!) or if they do, they're hesitant or unwilling to accommodate a request to add it to a different burger than the one veggie burger listed on the menu.  Why in the world, if you already have veggie patties on hand, do I have to order the ONE veggie burger you have listed?  Why can't I just substitute the veggie patty onto any other option?  It drives me bonkers.  But for Trident, this is never the case!  The mushroom swiss looks good to you?  They'll make it with a veggie patty.  The green chile burger looks great?  They'll make it a veggie.  Etc., etc., etc.  It's a standard Boca Burger, which are ok.  Normally I avoid Boca Burgers, but Trident makes me excited to eat a veggie burger!  I recommend the Green Chile with a Boca Burger, and add a fried egg.  Side salad and no bun if you want low carb.  Or, if you're indulging, side of mac & cheese.\n\nFor non-vegetarians, my friends are always happy to eat here too.  Popular choices among my friends include the grilled shrimp skewers, the non-veggie burgers, the crispy shrimp po-boy, and the paleo bowl.\n\nThey also have a fully stocked bar.  Good prices on their beverages.  And the wait staff has always been friendly and kind.\n\nWord of caution, if there's football on, it's probably going to be crowded here.

How are these not crumbling apart in my hand? This is a tortilla that can stand up to some serious manhandling, which is exactly what I did to my tacos. I would like to note that I would manhandle these on their own as a snack, or filled with cheese and green chiles. \n\nShrimp: Crispy until the end. Moderately battered. I won't say lightly - someone's dragging these through the batter with a heavyish hand, but I'm happy to say they're cooked perfectly and thoroughly enough that you don't encounter any flavorless globs of doughy disappointment. Just pure, deep fried ecstasy. \n\nSauce: White sauce of indeterminable origin. Mayonnaise? Vinegar? Crema? DELICIOUS. Cooly, tangy, and sour in the best way possible. Really the great unifier - bringing together while still accentuating the hot, crispy, shrimp, crunchy cabbage, and dense corn tortilla. \n\nBeans & Rice: Solid. Substantial. You're going to eat them. \n\nHorchata: Dude said people show up just for the horchata and I believe him. This doesn't come out of a fountain, and I'm not just saying that because I watched as it got ladled out of some giant tub resting on the counter top. You can taste the rice. This drink has texture, and what appears to be giant, lovely flecks of cinnamon bark. \n\nPina/Mango Juice: Fortifying. So tasty. Chunks of fresh pineapple.

It looked fantastic but his response was that it was blah. We had a child with us who ordered silver dollar pancakes. Instead of smaller kid friendly pancakes 3 larger pancakes were served. Two people ordered the yogurt parfait. It said it was layered with strawberry compote but instead it was fresh strawberries, blueberries and a sprinkling of granola.

While Indianapolis is a relatively old Midwestern city, the IMA's history is recent; it was known as the \"Art Association\" until 1969.\n\nThe recent multi-year renovation, redevelopment and expansion of the Museum and grounds created an entirely new experience for art patrons.  Let's all say our condolences to the Krannert Pavilion's Brutalist architecture of the 1970s and hello to a somewhat uninspired series of camera-ready atria that will no doubt allow some very impressive parties.\n\nThe collection itself is conservative and unprovoking.  Highlights include Robert Indiana's iconic masterwork (and trademark-infringed) \"LOVE\" painting and sculpture, a beautifully painted though incredibly ill-placed Rembrandt, a decent Hopper, an encyclopedic Asian art collection that is one of the best in the country, and the largest collection of JMW Turner drawings outside of Great Britain (although quantity does not trump quality).\n\nI thought the gift shop was as poorly stocked as the previous one.  Not a single postcard of the new museum's exterior, yet there were plenty of old postcards showing the now-demolished Krannert Pavilion.  And for an artwork that's been copied, dubiously appropriated and downright stolen, why was there not one postcard available of Robert Indiana's outdoor \"LOVE\" sculpture?  And what about museum merchandise based off its own artwork: scarves with motif from the museum's Tiffany piece, jewelry pieces mimicking something from the Asian galleries or pop-up note cards laser-cut with the new museum facade?  Sure, all the \"LOVE\" stuff is nice, but capitalize on other museum strengths.\n\nThis is a wonderful museum that has a decent collection.

It is so well designed, there is hardly a bad seat in the house. Even the ones in the pavilion take my breath away. And I love, love, love how the city is framed in the outfield. \n\nThe stadium is located in South Philly, wayyyy down there, away from downtown. It is nice because people can tailgate, which is like a great anthropological discovery for someone from a city whose stadium is right downtown. You can come early? And cook burgers? And drink beer? And you don't have do it at a bar? Fascinating! \n\nI was pleasantly surprised to discover the games feel shorter when you watch them at the stadium. I think this has a lot to do with the fact that the fans are kept entertained, even in the lull between innings. Plus the Phanatic has an effing hot dog bazooka! Come the hell on! But seriously, even if you don't know a thing about baseball, you will not be bored.\n\nThe tickets are relatively cheap for a professional sporting event, although they have become more difficult to obtain since the Phillies won the world series. Prior to this season, I used to be able to get decent seats the same week of the game without using a reseller. This is just what happens when your team kicks some serious ass, I suppose.\n\nThank god they have decent beer here. Seriously. Brewerytown carries Victory on tap and Dogfish Head in bottles. Since Prima Pils is my favorite pilsner, that makes me first a happy lady... then a drunk lady, despite the $7 price tag.\n\nIn addition to real beer, there is real food! There are even vegetarian options other than fries and pretzels. At my last game, I tried a cheesesteak from Tony Luke's. It was bready, but certainly nowhere near the worst I've ever had.

My dignity is still intact for the moment. \n\nFinally, I have read a few reviews that say Phillies fans are violent assholes, but I have to disagree. Passionate? Definitely.
