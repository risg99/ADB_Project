I knew that.  Neither was Rotier's.  But my handy Yelp app had assured me that Fido's was open.  Imagine the disappointment when I realized there was a very real possibility that no burgers would happen on this trip down to the Deep South.  Would I really have to wait two more weeks when I would find solace in East Texas?   \n\n\"We can try Burger up,\" I mentioned.  \n\n\"Why don't you just call them?\" hissed the appropriately nicknamed Viper.  \n\nTrue.  We didn't have to keep driving around aimlessly.  So I call Burger Up, and a very pleasant, sweet voice assures me they are indeed open.  \n\nViper: \"What was her name?  She sounded hot.\"\n  \nMe: \"Paige.\"\n\nViper: \"Yeah, she's definitely hot.  Have you ever met an unattractive Paige?\"\n\nMe: \"Good point.  At least we have that going for us.\"\n\nPaige was indeed attractive, but this review isn't about a photogenic individual who happens to work at Burger Up.  It's about what ended up being a visit to our fourth choice for burgers in Nashville.  \n\nBurger Up follows a national trend towards upscale burgers.  My particular order consisted of a medium rare patty served with aged cheddar, Benton's bacon (very good), and ketchup served on an artisan bun.  Basically, it was a gussied up bacon cheeseburger, but it was a rather tasty one.  My major complaint is that I wish the actual meat itself exhibited more flavor.  Having said that, the burger was cooked properly and the flavors worked well together.  I ordered some wilted spinach on the side (mediocre) and truffle fries.  Let's talk about those truffle fries for a bit.  I know more people are apparently into the sweet potato fries here, but I think they are missing the boat.  Burger Up's truffle tries have pleasant aroma, taste great, and are the perfect texture for soaking up oil.  If you are on a diet, it is true you should skip these delightful fries.  But if that were the case, why are you at a burger joint in the first place?  Seriously, if you get nothing else out of my review, please do yourself a favor and order the truffle fries.  \n\nBurger Up also boast an interesting beer menu with semi-obscure breweries from the Deep South included in the list.  I tried a pecan-infused amber from Mississippi - not bad.  I could imagine Burger Up could be a decent place to drink for a bit after eating.  \n\nIf I attended Vanderbilt, I would probably go here on a moderately frequent basis.  If you want a change from the dive bar hamburger, Burger Up is a decent change of pace.", "date": "2012-01-03 19:26:16"}, {"_key": "7088", "_id": "reviews/7088", "_rev": "_fNypmYC--J", "review_id": "mpbicWK7S-Prgv5lhreVDw", "user_id": "xwLpDq-rYnyObtBZCD0Wgg", "business_id": "Dv6RfXLYe1atjgz3Xf4GGw", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "I was looking for a gluten-free option, which basically left me with a taco salad.

We were promptly greeted by the hostess and seated at a table that felt a little \"hidden.\"  But, hey, there was another table in the section occupied, plus the hostess really seemed to put a lot of thought into where to seat us.  When we walked in, I did notice group of staff standing around the bar talking.  Strangely, I thought this was going to be a good thing -- lots of people to promptly bring us food and lots of drinks, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nSo, after being seated and given menus, we had enough time to memorize the menu.  I'm sure I'm just being a dick because it was like 10 minutes, but it wasn't that busy and the conglomeration of staff at the bar was fresh in my mind.\n\nFinally, our assigned server stopped by, expressing surprise that we were there.  Apparently/allegedly, the hostess failed to tell him that he had a table.  At least when he asked how long we had been waiting, I told him \"long enough that we were a minute away from leaving.\"\n\nSo, that unpleasantness aside, we started off with drinks.  I was glad to see that a decent selection of beers on tap (I went with Anchor Steam).  The wine list looked decent, but my menu only had half the list (it had the same page twice).  They do carry Green Truck organic wines and are reasonably priced (though it's not called Green Truck anymore, but I digress).\n\nAnyway, we had (and I can't copy and paste from their online menu, so if you want more details, go look at their website):\n\nTuna -- it's fine, but nothing special.  If anything, the tuna was overshadowed by lots of salad and bread.\n\nBacon wrapped dates stuffed with blue cheese with the balsamic reduction -- these were pretty good, but not mind blowing.\n\nGarlic Chile shrimp and sexy grits -- the consensus was \"this is scampi over grits.  And I have no idea why they're sexy, unless the big chunks of tomato and garlic was part of the sexiness.  Or was that part of the shrimp?  I don't know.   Our server did bring out some bread to sop up the sauce, which was nice.  And the bread was hot, so there's a plus.\n\nChicken kabob (jerk chicken with Key Lime yogurt drizzle) -- with Cafe Natasha so close, I wish we hadn't gotten this.  It was OK, but the sauce was way too sweet.\n\nIt might sound like a lot of food, but the portions are fairly small.\n\nLike any good bell curve, the end of the meal involved us waiting for a bit to get the check.  Oh well.\n\nWhen we left, I couldn't help but notice that there were three servers chatting with the hostess.  It's just weird.  I think they need to utilize their staff better.

I have two things to say. 1-they seemed to have put more attention into the way the food looked on the plate then the flavor of the food.  The plating was above average.  2- if you go, try to stick to basic dishes that are hard to mess up,  for example there seared ahi tuna dish was a disaster, but there grilled chicken sandwich was good.

I would like to note that I would manhandle these on their own as a snack, or filled with cheese and green chiles. \n\nShrimp: Crispy until the end. Moderately battered. I won't say lightly - someone's dragging these through the batter with a heavyish hand, but I'm happy to say they're cooked perfectly and thoroughly enough that you don't encounter any flavorless globs of doughy disappointment. Just pure, deep fried ecstasy. \n\nSauce: White sauce of indeterminable origin. Mayonnaise? Vinegar? Crema? DELICIOUS. Cooly, tangy, and sour in the best way possible. Really the great unifier - bringing together while still accentuating the hot, crispy, shrimp, crunchy cabbage, and dense corn tortilla. \n\nBeans & Rice: Solid. Substantial. You're going to eat them. \n\nHorchata: Dude said people show up just for the horchata and I believe him. This doesn't come out of a fountain, and I'm not just saying that because I watched as it got ladled out of some giant tub resting on the counter top. You can taste the rice. This drink has texture, and what appears to be giant, lovely flecks of cinnamon bark. \n\nPina/Mango Juice: Fortifying. So tasty. Chunks of fresh pineapple.

We came prepared with reservations, but the restaurant actually began quieting out while our delicious meal was ramping up; the tables offer more elbow room than the photographs online belie.  As the name of the evening suggests, no menu is in play here; you'll let your friendly server know if you have any food allergies or particular preferences, and before long watch your customized meal unfold.  That's a three-course meal, $30, plus $12 for three half-glass wine pairings.\n\nAs starters, we were served lamb meatballs -- likely the favorite of the night -- and goat cheese-stuffed poblano peppers.  The peppers had a good bit of spice offset by the chalkiness of the goat cheese, making an excellent pairing for my Soave (white wine).  The mains were a corvina fish delicately cooked in wax paper and a swordfish steak served over asparagus with homegrown tomatoes and \"love sauce.\"  The corvina came out on the rarer side, perhaps a little too complex for this Midwesterner's palate, but the hearty swordfish was some of the best seafood I've tasted in Missouri.  Dessert comprised a champagne gelatin and a chocolate tart, both of which were topped by fluffy homemade whipped cream and quickly eaten.\n\nThe staff at Home Wine Kitchen made our visit pleasant, acting casual yet professional during our meal.  The restaurant patrons seemed to be largely industry types that oohed and aahed about the cuisine (perhaps a trifle self-importantly, but this Yelper is no saint himself).  I was surprised to note that other diners were served the same courses as we were (albeit in different configurations), when I was under the assumption there would be a little more variation; however, I can only imagine the challenge such an endeavor would pose to the talented kitchen.  The interior, lighting, and volume here were all very good.\n\nBy the end of the evening, we realized that putting yourself in the hands of the chef is not for the faint of heart, as evidenced by one conversation near us during the meal that all but stopped when a beautiful whole fish was served to the table.  Leaving the restaurant, I was glad that I had tried No Menu Monday, but did wonder what the meal would have been like had I ordered off the menu.

And, one of those options is DARK roast?  Color me caffeinated.  I promptly ordered their dark roast which came poured out of a carafe left at the table.  Plus, they have flavored creamer (bonus!).

Always a fan of anything including hollandaise sauce--I went for it.  My people!  Perfection.  Here's the thing, when you smother something in hollandaise, you can easily be lazy in the preparation of what comes UNDERNEATH the hollandaise.  I mean, it's going to be smothered in all that lovely, buttery deliciousness--who will notice?  I will notice, people.  I will.  And, there was definitely nothing lackadaisical about the preparation of this dish.  The salmon, even without the hollandaise, was moist and flavorful.  The eggs were perfectly, beautifully, delicately poached.  It was the single best Salmon Benedict I've ever consumed (possibly the best Eggs Benedict in general!).  \n\nThe Benedict came with a side of home fried potatoes, which had a light peppery flavor that I quite enjoyed.  The service was spot on--prompt, attentive, and friendly.\n\nOne final note I have is the menu:  The menu is expansive.  If you have family and/or friends in town with diverse tastes--this is a wonderful option for breakfast.  They have all your classic selections covered (bacon & eggs, chicken fried steak, various scrambles).  They have the sweet (pancakes, stuffed french toast, waffles, crepes).

I don't like Panera either, so if you think the food there is awesome maybe you will like this place more than I did. The best way I can think to describe it is like the food you might get on a fancy mediterranean airline. It was edible and had some nice flavors, but just wasn't great.

I was telling a mildly entertaining story with linear progression, wasn't I? \n\nSo: I was *famished,* and wanted nothing more than to start w/ one of their amazing cocktails, but knew I needed to put something in that stomach of mine first.\n\nSo... to the eats.\n\n1. A beet salad starter which Brit and I shared. Goat cheese and spinach and beets and yup, you guessed it. So so good, as beet salads can be when they're done right. Then?\n\n2. A chanterelle mushroom & fresh vegetable pot pie. Oh my god, I can't even. I love chanterelles, I love pot pies (secret favorite thing), so... you get the idea. Clearly handmade with fresh ingredients, I couldn't stop eating it. It was effing delicious. I was full, and yet, I kept eating. So so good.\n\nThe rest of the bites on the menu were on that whole gastro tip with an emphasis on the more foodie-focused. (God, I still hate the word foodie. I really do.) What I mean? I don't remember seeing offal or brains, but along those lines for sure. Marrow, elk, etc.\n\nAnyways, moving on (and this is important). To the cocktail: our very attentive/sweet server and I talked through a myriad of offerings and possibilities, and after much ado about bourbon, we settled on a variation of Seelbach with a locally aged bourbon. It was absolutely perfect.

So were the fries. They were tasty, not overly salted nor greasy. You get a huge amount per order ($5), but were pretty much soggy because of the huge amount piled together. The garlic parm aoili was O.K., could have used more garlic.You can get these fries as poutine, or w/ other toppings for an additional $1-4.The veggie wrap was standard, but decent.

When we got checked in the lady checking me in wasn't very personable but wasnt rude or anything, maybe it was due to us being there at 5 am, not many people are awake at that time. As we got in the elevator to go upstairs the power went out and of course I wanted to get out since the elevators doors had closed and I thought we were stuck, but all I did was push the help button and the elevator doors opened and I was extremely relieved. Of course once the elevators were back up I was a little scared to ride it up to our floor but I did fine. The common areas of the hotel were nicely done, very classy and the room was nicely decorated, up to date, and we had a partial arch view. Same day but much later.....our room wasn't cleaned when we arrived after being out the whole day  so we were a little disappointed in that but all it needed was to have the beds made so it wasnt a big deal. Our second night I will have to say I saw an influx of people, seemed like a lot of college or baseball fans, one or the other. That night we were woken up by someone pounding on a door and shouting to be let in, I thought someone was surely trying to break in. It was our lovely neighbors who were having some kind of lovers quarrel, three guys trying to get back in their hotel room and a mad girlfriend not letting them in or something along those lines. My bf went out and set them straight and they left. Well I finally dozed off and again we hear this damn pounding loud enough to wake us up, I guess guy is finally allowed in but I still call front desk. Third time woken up is when security knocks on their door and they come out and speak so freaking loud I wake up again. Fourth time I hear a large group of girls and guys shouting. laughing, and interacting with the idiot next door. If it wouldnt have lasted less then a couple minutes security would have been called again. The rest of the night was fine but dealing with this definately put a damper on my night. The next day when we checked out we explained the situation and security had the info to back it all up. We were given a credit to one of their restaurants so I appreciated their effort since they didnt have any control over their rowdy guests.

We found it tucked in a little business center across from the Dunkin Donuts in Newtown PA. It is brand new and has taken over the same spot as Mamita's Latino had. It is worth seeking it out if you want to try real deal quality Indian food.\nWe were seated by a friendly gentleman and fresh papadam (which is a crispy wafer-like cracker/tortilla) and chutneys were brought to the table immediately.\n\nThe appetizers we had were Potato Samosas with a delicious tamarind chutney and a biting fresh cilantro chutney. Very crispy and filled with savory potatoes and peas in a crispy wrap.\nBoth were excellent. \n\nWe also had chili paneer, which really could be an entree. It was as hot as I wanted it to be but still you can tell a deft hand, who knows spices, created this dish (yummy beyond words!) and a we tried an interesting Panipuri. It was  a twist on the typical one you see on the Sunday buffets. This one was filled with crunchy toasted confetti and creamy avocado. Light and refreshing! Perhaps, you can tell my family loves appetizers and it would have been plenty of food if we stopped there but since it was so good we couldn't help but try as many things as our chubby tummies would hold.\n\nNorthern Indian food has always been my favorite style of Indian food but it can be heavy.\nIt seems some restaurants think the more cream and butter the better but Guru's knows how to balance richness without killing all the flavors of the dish. So, being the hungry hungry hippos we are, here are our entrees:\nPalak Aloo- which is spicy, smooth spinach and potatoes,\nChili chicken- an Indo Chinese dish that was seasoned to mouth watering perfection ,Kind of like a General Tso's on steroids and spice. It is one of our favorites.\nPaneer Makhni- a homemade Indian cheese cube kind of  like a tasty tofu but better.in creamy tomato curried sauce .It's rich and creamy but not drowning in fat like so many other restaurants. The breads are fresh made to order. We found out this place is a BYOB so that certainly is a plus for our next visit. We had mango lassi and,chai tea this time but an Indian beer would be awesome with this meal.  \n\nWe finally surrendered after we tried the kheer which is Indian rice pudding .(Forget about the gloopy baby food the diners sell this is Awesome) .We can't wait to try the buffet that will be starting Thursday September 3rd 2015.", "date": "2015-08-30 20:42:04"}, {"_key": "8806", "_id": "reviews/8806", "_rev": "_fNypmbm--G", "review_id": "OvVJtBRgEWlvhyiV_OYFvg", "user_id": "yj5M-Ibiwmnif1OI4DJ5-g", "business_id": "l7b33ubze8Jqw7C4I1CAuA", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Stayed here for one night prior to cruising out.

I reckon it's not so easy to find an unhaunted hotel in these parts, the city that is called--among other things--the most haunted city in America.  New Orleans also has some of the best food, music, art and people anywhere. But back to the hotel, there is a certain just-past-its-prime grandeur to the decor. I liked it.

We split an order, and I still couldn't finish.\n\nThat's not really a complaint, though.  Just be aware that, if you're going for beignet, you should bring an appetite - and two friends.  Anyway, we stumbled across this little gem while we were wandering around the French Quarter, trying to figure out what we wanted to eat.  The atmosphere is wonderful - the Cafe sits at the back of an open courtyard, with tables (some under a patio), and on Friday night, there were musicians playing jazz.  The music carried well, without being so loud we couldn't carry on a conversation.  I believe if you went up the stairs, there was a bar up there (although, probably another establishment).  I'm tempted to give this place five stars for the atmosphere alone, but a restaurant is more than atmosphere.  It was a wonderful way to spend a Friday evening.\n\nOther than the beignet, the food was fine.  It was nothing spectacular, but I got a pretty good club, and my fiance got a pretty good roast beef po'boy.  My bread was a little stale - it happens.  It seemed like we had to wait an awfully long time for the beignet to come out.  I know they're fried fresh, but I've also made them before, and I know it doesn't take 15 minutes.

Sam's is just mediocre.  \n\nThe service is always a toss up, and the ladies dressed in those referee outfits - could you not find some attractive Southern women to put on those booty shorts and v-cut referee shirts?  Some of the regular old-time employees who have been there since I was in undergrad - a decade ago - really should not be wearing tight clothes.  Wow.  That was just really mean.

She then left for over 10 minutes (during which time a manager or some other employee came behind the bar but made no acknowledgement of us, or attempted to take our order)...and then upon return, did not apologize, but asked if we've decided what we want...well, i decided prior to you leaving, and i sure as hell hope within 10 minutes I'd have decided on one drink!\n\nShe then took the other people who had accumulated's orders prior to serving our solitary glass of wine and one iced tea...and she asked if it was for here or to go, after taking out the glass.

But seriously, even if you don't know a thing about baseball, you will not be bored.\n\nThe tickets are relatively cheap for a professional sporting event, although they have become more difficult to obtain since the Phillies won the world series.

This is just what happens when your team kicks some serious ass, I suppose.\n\nThank god they have decent beer here. Seriously. Brewerytown carries Victory on tap and Dogfish Head in bottles. Since Prima Pils is my favorite pilsner, that makes me first a happy lady... then a drunk lady, despite the $7 price tag.\n\nIn addition to real beer, there is real food! There are even vegetarian options other than fries and pretzels. At my last game, I tried a cheesesteak from Tony Luke's. It was bready, but certainly nowhere near the worst I've ever had.

Though these guys have the fancier 7' version.  \n\nIn a nutshell this place is pretty cool.  The bartender, I shamefully forgot her name, is super friendly and fantastic.  \n\nThe atmosphere is that of any place near fishing camps or docks, mixed company but always fun.  Meaning super drunk old men and super drunk young guys. Well heeled tourist and the local handicapped fella.  All a recipe for fun.  \nThe AC works big time, also makes it pretty cool. \nBottle beer selection is a little thin, other than the main three there is Corona and $1.25 Rolling Rock.  Good prices here, a round of three beers goes for $7.  If you buy everyone  in the bar Rolling Rock you'll only be out  $10. Look like a hero ;)\n\nThere is karaoke and bands on some nights.  Pool tables and a pile of old juke boxes and broken games in the corner. \nIf your in the area, definitely stop in and get a seat at the bar.

Mistake! \n\nUpon entering we saw the sign for the lunch special wish we were both excited about, hey $5.99! We sat down and the waitress seemed friendly. She showed us the lunch menu. I decided to get the taco special and 1 chicken tamale to try (im still seachung for great tamales). Of course like a few other places that I have been too lately, my waitress comes from the kitchen to announce no tamles are ready for today.

It came out in due time  only to find out I was not very happy with the food at all. Actually took me a little while to eat my second taco. The positive thing about the meal was the portions. The two tacos were large. It just did not taste like authentic Mexican tacos. It tastes like something that I could easily make at home. American best-try kind-of tacos. Another star gone. \n\nWe ready to go soon enough and we ask for separate check which the waiter said that she could do. However she did not bring out separate checks. In fact my coworker had to ask how much her meal was. The waitress had to go back and count up for her total and then come back and tell her how much the her portion was. Well knowing that I only spent about $7 in the restaurant I did not think I needed to do the same. Mistake. I was very surprised when found out my meal was almost $11 when my card was ran. Apparently it was extra for the cilantro onion even know the meal came with tomatoes and lettuce which I asked for instead. Never was told it was extra. I knew I had to pay for extra chees, but dang!  Management came out upon my request to give me a breakdown of the bill, especially since I couldn't get itemized bill. I was not happy, not buying the explaination, nor impressed. They give me a small, change of a refund and vowed to NEVER be back. \n\nNo tamales, no detailed bill, no prior knowledge of changes would be extra, food not great at all...

But I wasn't planning a trip back to Austin for a while and badly needed a cut, so I decided to bite the bullet.\n\nMy friend walks in a few weeks ago with *srsly* the cutest short hair cut. And so I ask her who and where, and she says Rodney Mitchell. I figured that this place would be too expensive, but she corrected my thinking on the matter. So I called to make an appointment with her guy (whose name I sadly cannot remember at the moment) and Rodney answered the phone. Turns out the guy my friend had seen didn't do morning appointments and all my afternoons were filled, so Rodney said \"look, I'm the owner, I can absolutely vouch for Allison who has several openings in the next few days.\" So I thought, alright, he's the owner so he knows his stuff--I'll do it.\n\nAllison absolutely did not disappoint. First off, she's a total sweetheart, but not super chatty (I appreciate stylists who can be content to both hold and not hold a convo while working) so there was no pressure there. I came in with my laptop and several photos I'd found that approximated what I wanted in a haircut, as I couldn't find exactly the right one. We talked about it a bit, discussed front and back length, bangs, etc. and she said alright and went to it. What she gave me was the cutest damn shaggy bob that I never thought possible. I seriously can't wait to go back.\n\nOne of the other awesome things about RMS is that they give you a discount for your first visit and I believe they have some kind of discount for students and teachers. They also will give you *another* discount when you refer people. So I got my friend a discount, and then referred a friend, so I'll get another discount when I go back for my next cut.

Highly recommend sitting right up at the bar so you can watch the oysters being shucked - very cool!\n\nTrip One:\nIt was my first night in New Orleans and I was starving!  I went on Yelp to see what was around my hotel and noticed that Harrah's casino was right across the street.  Having been the Harrah's in Atlantic City several times (more times than I'd like to admit), I knew that there had to be good restaurants associated with the casino.  I strolled into Grand Isle around 7pm on a Tuesday night, and thankfully it wasn't busy.  I took a seat at the bar and ordered my first local beer - the Nola Blonde.  For an appetizer, I ordered the shrimp gumbo - how touristy of me!  It was really good!  Everything shrimp gumbo should taste like.  For dinner, I decided on the house made gator sausage po boy.  OH MY GOD amazing!  The flavors worked so well together and the gator sausage was delicious.  I knew instantly that I'd be getting this again before I headed back to PA.\n\nI'm not sure if martinis were on special that night, but I saw a ton of them being ordered.  The ladies next to me got louder and more hilarious as the night went on, so I'm assuming the martinis were pretty good haha.\n\nTrip Two (two days after trip one):\nMy boyfriend arrived in New Orleans and I told him I had to take him to a few, great restaurants I had tried earlier in the week.  We headed over to Grand Isle!  For an appetizer, we got the Isle Sampler of oysters.  All of them were delicious, but the oysters fulton (with bacon, cheddar, and onions) was my favorite.  So good!  For entrees, I once again ordered the gator sausage po boy and my boyfriend got the shrimp caminada po boy (which had apparently won an award at the po boy festival in the past year or two).  You've already read my review about the gator po boy, so let me tell you about the shrimp caminada:  IT WAS DELICIOUS.  Asian herb slaw was amazing and the shrimp was plentiful.  I can see why this won awards.\n\nWe spoke with the bartender a little bit, who was a super nice guy.  Turns out he's from NJ, so it was nice to run into someone from our homeland.\n\nIn short:  Go to Grand Isle.  Get some oysters, shrimp caminada po boy, the gator po boy, and a lot of beer (and maybe some martinis? haha).

I decided that this, self, is the day you will begin liking whiskey. So I petitioned the bartender to \"make me something awesome with whiskey in it.\" \"What kind of drink do you want?,\" he inquired. \"I have no idea, good sir. You see, I am a neophyte, a tyro, and fledgling when it comes to spirits such as these.\" (Perhaps my banter wasn't quite at this level at the time; I was already a few drinks in from my visit to Franklin Mortgage, but this is how I remember it going.) So, he thought about it for a while and proceeded to mix up the craziest drink I had ever seen -- it had whiskey, orange bitters, an egg white, Portuguese red wine, and other stuff in it! The verdict: delicious. I also had the \"The Commodore\" off the drink menu, and it was very good, too. The drinks are a little pricey here, and they will set you back around $11 or $12 each.\n\nWhen our friends arrived, we were seated outside and I got to try to village burger and the short-rib and cheddar duck-fat fries.

It lived up to its reputation of serving fresh food. I give it three stars instead of four mainly because it's probably not on my top 10 places in Reno for Mexican food. Chipotle is not even my favorite Mexican-themed chain restaurant. That would be El Pollo Loco.\nFor my meal I got a burrito with beef, black beans, white rice, sour cream, cheese, lettuce and maybe some other stuff. I added a patrone margarita and a bag of chips with what they described as their hottest sauce.\nI had to wait about a month to try the place because the lines were so long the previous times I came. The staff was friendly when I placed my order. I got my burrito, chips and salsa when I paid and the maragarita came a few minutes later.\nChipotle failed to live up to the hype with my first bite of food. The chips are good quality chips. The salsa tastes mass produced. It was supposed to be their hottest salsa but it had a streak of that sweet ketchup flavor some shows up in salsas some times. My favorite salsas are the red salsa from the Michoacan region of Mexico with its nice garlic kick. \nThe ingredients in the burrito were fresh, but there were two significant flaws. No. 1 is that the rice overwhelmed everything else. Usually if one ingredient overwhelms a burrito it seems it is the beans, but not in this case. It made the burrito bland and a little dry. The second flaw was all the gristle I found on the beef. My tray had more than a half dozen chunks of inedible meat on it by the time I finished. I decided to spare Yelpers a photo of that.\nThe margarita was okay. I'd get one again but it was routine.\nThere's basically two kinds of wine bars: Those that serve wine that wine geeks like (these are the ones that have the hardest time surviving) and those that are a place where women feel safe to drink. I get the sense that Chipotle is a Mexican restaurant designed to make gringos feel safe to eat there.  Again, for a chain, they serve good quality food. I can get better food for less money at a half dozen taquerias around town. \nChipotle is a smoke jalapeno used in cooking. For people who have never had a good chipotle in a Mexican restaurant, I would suggest trying the camarones ala diabla (devil shrimp) at La Fuente in Sparks.

It's a cakey donut hole with sweet icing draped over it. Generally, I'm more a yeast donut fan but those buttermilk drops were delightful. I could have eaten a half dozen, no sweat. But there were other items to try. \n\nDistrict has \"croquenuts\" available which is their version of a griddled donut sandwich. I chose the \"Monte Cristo\" for it's sweet and savory combination. Gooey cheese and salty ham between a donut covered in powdered sugar with a hefty dollop of raspbery preserves nestled in the center of the donut. This was a magical creation. Get it if you have the chance.\n\nFinally, to top of my donut extravaganza, I chose the Miso Olive Oil Praline Bacon donut. It's a mouthful to say but wasn't to consume. Such a fascination combination of flavors from this donut. I chose it mostly for the bacon but the miso, olive oil, and praline each hit their notes with every bite. Simply wonderful. \n\nNot to forget was the the Vietnamese Iced Coffee to wash it all down.

The decor is that of a boxing ring/gym. It is very clean with a fair bit of room. It is surrounded by a dozen or more TVs for watching multiple games playing at the same time. Their food is focused on standard bar/pub fare with an emphasis on burgers and fried foods. There is a second lounge area that is still under construction. They intend to have Karaoke there twice a week and possibly a cigar bar. The new lounge has a more upscale feel to it and an impressive bar area.\n\nOn the first visit I ordered the BBQ Burger (I forgotten the name it is under on the menu). It is a 1/3 pound burger patty served with onion rings, BBQ sauce and I believe lettuce and tomato. The burger stands pretty tall, too tall for a human being to eat it. However, removing some of the stacked onion rings brought the height down to a useful level. The flavor was good and despite the heft and wetness of a BBQ burger, the bun stood up to the task and did not fall apart. I had a side of onion rings and they were excellent.\n\nMy second visit was today and I only ordered an appetizer for lunch: the stuffed, deep-fried mushrooms. The site of the mushroom heads was about 2\" across and each mushroom had been cut in half before they were deep fried. I think this diminished the whole \"stuffed\" aspect of the mushrooms as there didn't seem to be much stuffing in evidence. The flavor of the mushrooms was excellent, as was the texture of the mushroom flesh, very firm and moist.\n\nThey do have a pool table, 1 or 2 darts machines and the ubiquitous Touch Tunes music system. The staff is very friendly and I found the service to be prompt. The food took a little time to get out, but I suspect that is simply because the place is new and they are still ironing out the kinks.\n\nI'm giving this 5 stars for a sports bar.

For a brief moment I felt like a kid in a candy shop. Oh wait, I was in a candy shop, that had an ice cream parlor too. \n\nThe young lady working the counter was very patient with me, as I was having a hard time selecting my first Blue Bell flavor. I finally went with, Birthday Cake. It was a rich creamy vanilla with pieces of chocolate cake and swirls of chocolate icing and bright colored sprinkles. I'm sure you have heard, sprinkles are for winners. After enjoying my Blue Bell, I now understand not only the love the South has for this ice cream, but why the South has an obesity problem. This ice cream is too good to resist. \n\nNow, I'll talk about the RSC. This store was amazing, I had no idea they had so much to offer. They had pre-boxed, by the piece, Jelly Belly jelly beans, Weight Watchers candy and some the most decadent caramel apples. This is a great place for picking up a gift for that special Aunt, Grandma or person that stumps you every time on what to get them. \n\nPersonally I prefer local chocolates, Kakao and Bissinger's, but for gifts and Blue Bell, I will keep this candy store on my shopping list.", "date": "2015-03-18 18:18:23"}, {"_key": "10585", "_id": "reviews/10585", "_rev": "_fNypmMK--S", "review_id": "TWJcqWkvjeg02pbWxP30og", "user_id": "0wxPhmyip7Nu8R_Ce0PNzw", "business_id": "-sSGKR1V1oBm7BJicIXozg", "stars": 3, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I love the old building and location of this place...that's about all I loved.

I've visited this store many times (it's only a few blocks from our house--we live in the Garden District / Irish Channel), and have had no small share of weird or rude encounters.  Previously, it was decidedly unfriendly looks from the staff, noting encounters with patrons who wanted to keep their purses rather than surrender them at the front counter, etc.  I continued to visit, however, because there's a certain sort of eclectic \"junk pile\" vibe here and some genuinely interesting stuff. This time, the epic unfriendliness of the staff was directed squarely at us, however.\n\nOne detail omitted from the previous description of this encounter is when Elsa tried to diffuse the situation with the female owner, the husband (?), rather than trying to also diffuse the situation and (perhaps?) sell something, immediately not only made the \"tell the police to hurry up\" remark  but also tried to throw additional and unrelated fuel on the fire, and blame the kids for breaking things.  Since they were picking vintage comic books for purchase with me, in a different area of the store, and the lamp was on a high shelf elsewhere, that's a little hard to digest.\n\nI'd also like to reinforce how nice it was to have other patrons who were also going to buy things simply leave the store and follow us next door to La Davina (highly recommended gelato) to discuss what happened.\n\nIf you're visiting New Orleans and looking for antiques, I strongly encourage you to check out the other offerings on Magazine St.  If you're a local, I think it's obvious that except possibly as an anti-gentrification move, we really don't want a visitor's experience on the otherwise fantastic Magazine St. stretch to include this sort of abuse.  And finally, if you're considering consigning your merchandise to be sold by this store, I encourage you to first be an observant \"customer\", and decide if you believe anything will actually be sold at all, given the attitude of the owners.  There are better choices. \n\nPlease don't support this horrible store.

I ordered a \"frozen\" margarita. It was the only frozen margarita on the menu and was pomegranate. It was okay, but a little off for my tastes. It was also melted and no longer frozen within a few minutes of it arriving. I only finished about half of it. We ordered during happy hour when the margarita is supposed to be $5 instead of the usual $9. We had to ask for the happy hour price, but more on that in a moment. \n\nThree of us decided to split a queso fundito. This is one of my favorite Mexican Appetizers and I order it regularly at traditional Mexican restaurants. While the queso fundito was still good at Besito, it was disappointing to someone that has had a traditional version. It is supposed to be essentially a fondue type pot of melted cheese with some chorizo and served with tortillas. Besito cheapened theirs by adding piles of onions and peppers. It was also served in a very shallow square skillet. When split three ways (and with the 2-3 others in the room that tried it), it left very little queso fundito. The flavor was good. However, with the added thick peppers and onions and the small quantity, I would not order again. \n\nI was able to try the chips, salsa and table side guacamole also. I will say that this is probably the best guacamole that I have ever tried. I loved the flavor and the thick chunks of avocado. The salsa and guac were my favorite things at Besito. However, I can't see myself paying $10 for guac on a return visit. That is just way too much for guacamole in my opinion. \n\nFor my meal, I ordered the Chile Rellenos Con Hongos. I order Rellenos anytime I see them on the menu since they are one of my favorite things. Most restaurants serve them with some rice and beans or some sort of side. Let's face it...stuffed relleno peppers are not the most filling thing in the world. My Rellenos did not come with a side. The came with sauce and nothing else for a whopping $18. I almost didn't order them when I saw the price, but everything else on the menu was that price or higher. The Rellenos had good flavor for the first bite...or maybe two. However, a few bites in I was over it. They are stuffed in goat cheese and there are globs of goat cheese on the outside. So much freaking goat cheese. I like the stuff, but it was overboard. That wasn't the worst part though, it was the pine nuts. There seemed to be a whole bag of the things mixed into my small plate. I would never order this again. \n\nOur service was great until it came time for the checks. Our waitress did not give us happy hour prices for the margaritas we ordered before happy hour was up. She also messed up dividing our appetizer between the three checks. However, the worst was that we handed the checks to them with our cards in each individual envelope. When they returned, my card was with my friends check (and had been charged) and my check was missing. WTH? It ended up taking us about 45 minutes to get our checks, get them corrected, get them corrected again and get out of there. My poor husband had dropped me off and was waiting outside this whole time since I thought I was almost done when I received the check. Uggg. \n\nI don't think I will be back to Besito anytime soon. If I do, it will be for happy hour only.

The grape vines on the trellises were beautiful and healthy and just about to burst into fruit! \n\nOur entrees included the walnut encrusted trout, seafood linguine - clams, shrimp, white fish, mussels, over bed of linguine, and a lamb kofte special.  The trout was a healthy serving and perfectly prepared. Clams, mussels and shrimp over a bed of linguine was another healthy portion and half ended up in a to-go box! Again, delicious, attractively presented and perfectly prepared.  Lamb is a personal favorite, but if I had it to do over again, I would've opted for something else. It tasted ok (meat was a bit dry)  but less than appealing appearance-wise: looked like two crisscrossed sausages. It came with a very thin (runny) yogurt cucumber sauce - not the standard tzatziki one would expect. Entrees will run you about $22, pastas around $16-18, so it's not overly pricey, but the addition of a couple adult beverages or bottle of wine can change that in a heartbeat.\n\nAll in all, it's a nice place with good food and attentive service. We all voted we would be back.", "date": "2015-05-13 01:02:39"}, {"_key": "12546", "_id": "reviews/12546", "_rev": "_fNypmPa--L", "review_id": "lV39IEH03QNbgwor146lGQ", "user_id": "KFFIyUxC0TQjx__OYlmhnA", "business_id": "2KIDQyTh-HzLxOUEDqtDBg", "stars": 5, "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Everything you want to eat and drink is here.

If everything works out good we're going to Belize, Mexico and Honduras. We booked the trip about a month ago and this is her first time at sea during the Christmas holiday.\n\nSunday, Day 1 - Our room was a mess! The windows were so dirty my wife decided to clean them off herself. The chairs were covered in salt and when you sat on them the salt transferred on to your clothing. Then after walking in and out of the room we noticed that salt and dirt was tracking in to the room. We finally called  down to the front desk and they sent someone up to clean it off. We hold gold cards so that means we sailed at least 25 days but less then 75 and never have I've seen such a dirty ship. Dinner was OK, we are in the cafeteria not the dining room. The kids had pizza and I had chicken, again dinner was OK. \n\nMonday, Day 2 - The weather was nice so we played in the pool, kicked back in the Adult only area and I drank as much as possible. A big BBQ lunch out on the lanai deck with Ocean views! Dinner was an absolute disaster. It was formal night and it took us over an hour to get our food. There was six of us at the table and our ribs were cold and the corn was burnt. The pasta was not very good,how do you screw up pasta. Just about everything felt and tasted like it's been sitting for a long time. We complained but zero customer service!! The comedy club was awesome. Also, midnight room service was good. BLT's and cookies!! \n\nTuesday, Day 3 - another day at sea where we did the same thing we did the day before. The BBQ again was awesome. Pools were fun and we played cards inside and listen to all the trivia games because it got a little windy outside. I was hoping to avoid any negativity today but I have to tell you breakfast absolutely sucked. The eggs were very runny, the French toast was BAD and the eggs Benedict was not very good. Other then that it was a fun day at see. We ended the night at the comedy club and it was so much fun!\n\nWednesday, Day 4 - we arrive at an island off the coast of Hunderus and it was beautiful. The town where the ship parks is very pretty from the ship, however, you soon find out that the area they drop you in is owned by Carnival. Everything is for rent, everything is for sale and everything to me feels FAKE! The sand, the trees, the buildings and even the food. My kid said that the french fries were the same as the ones on the ship. So here is what you do!! Get a cab to the West end of the island. You will see most of the island driving there. The best snorkeling is on the West end and there is plenty to see and do. We got back on the boat, took lots of pictures and had dinner again back in the dinning room. Again it was disappointing and we said that tonight is the last night. The staff is not good, the food is bad and we are extremely disappointed. We're talking 3 generations of people, Grandparents, parents and kids that are 9 & 17. Carnival if your listing, you have a problem. Keep in mind people I was on another ship two weeks ago. The food was great!! So we ended the night watching a movie out by the pool on the big screen and it was awesome!!\n\nThursday, Day 5 - We arrived in Belize and there are a lot of fun things to do. If you can't snorkel, take the kids to Old Belize, check out the picks, the place was great!!  Dinner in the dinning room again! The food was really good tonight but the service was really slow. Comedy club after dinner was fun and a little piano bar to top everything off.\n\nFriday, Day 6 - Cozumel Mexico was a blast. We got off the boat early and we were one of the last ones on. Dinner in the dinning room again just sucked. This boat is just too big for the food and service to be as good as other ships I've been on. We watched a movie outside under the stars and enjoyed our last night with warm weather. \n\nSaturday, Day 7 - Day at sea, BBQ on the Lani deck again was great. Trivia, corn hole and another movie on the big screen under the stars. No dinning room tonight, it sucks we have to tip them. I discovered that the chicken quesadillas that room service offers may be the best I've ever had. Our bags are already outside and we are ready to disembark.  \n\nThe big ships are fun but service is sacrificed. What really sucks is that Carnival does not have the roads or the channels in place for a guests complaint to get heard by a person that has the ability to make a change. Policies and procedures are in place and rarely does change occur. This was my 4th cruise and my least favorite by far.

We notified our server and he ended up bringing us two additional oysters which was nice, but seriously?! How does a restaurant like this hire people that don't know the basics of counting?

Alas, neither of us could taste much difference. The flavors were extremely subtle.\n\nWhat I did love however was the creaminess and texture. This is where it gets close to the Bi-Rite status. The ice cream itself is very rich and smooth with perfect consistency. You simply can't buy something like this in the store.

I did notice relief of symptoms such as bloating and insomnia during this phase. This phase includes a protein shake and some nutritional supplements made by Xymogen and other reputable companies. Mostly an array of vitamins and amino acids. The rest of the program is basically to recommend a Paleo-style eating program with some additional supplementation. The doctor recommended a formulation to help increase my energy levels (the testing results showed me as having severe adrenal fatigue) which he makes and is a liquid herbal tincture taken under the tongue. Except his office was out of the formulation and it took 10 days to get. When I did get it I used it as directed for the next month and I lost all the sleep benefits I had gained.  I told Dr. Nelson I felt the supplements during the elimination phase seemed to be much better for my body. He poo-pooed that idea and kept the supplements the same but reduced the dosages. I never got back to feeling as good as during the elimination diet phase and slowly lost interest in the program as it wasn't doing anything helpful and is incredibly expensive. The program cost is $6800 paid over six months. While I am glad I tried the program and found some limited success during the elimination diet it is hard to maintain that way of eating while working and traveling, etc. I will try to incorporate a mini 3-day elimination period about once a month though, and do continue to eat primarily grain-free, as I am a big believer in the benefits of avoiding all grain (and legumes). For anyone thinking about this program, in my experience it was not worth anywhere near $6800. I still have some lab tests to do to compare with my original results, but the only thing that was \"wrong\" in my initial labs was adrenal fatigue (which I wasn't surprised by). There are some things the doctor doesn't check for such as Candida and Pyroluria which I would have liked to be included. Also, they really sell the program as a concierge program and encourage you to call or email anytime with questions. My experience was that you got the information by pulling teeth if you got it at all. When I had questions about the lab tests and wondered if the lab tests had included a test for Candida I didn't get a call back from the doctor but rather a call from the office manager telling me she had spoken to the doctor and he said Candida wasn't my issue.

From an event planner's viewpoint, I was over the moon happy with how professional Telisha Cobb (co-owner) and the entire MMW team were. (especially during their opening week!)\nI hope to host another event here soon!\n\nHowever, I am also reviewing this as an attendee for the Wanda Jackson show the following night. \n\nYes, I said it... the fan-frickin-tastic Wanda Jackson who is still very much a charming and incredibly talented little minx on stage. What a great way to launch a brand new venue with a music legend. \n\nThis gorgeously executed venue is massive with over 14,000 square feet of event space that can accommodate around 1500 standing attendees. The design layout is very thoughtful with 2 bar and restroom areas (on both Yelp Helps and Wanda Jackson, there was never more than a few person wait for the ladies loo. Shocking, right?) I also very much appreciate the front box-office area that is open at specific times for consumers to purchase tickets and avoid the sometimes highway robbery that is known as the ticket processing business. Ample free parking on the street and available secure parking lot spots are also available for a reasonable $5. \nThe icing on the cake for me is the coat check area. Ladies, you know what I mean... the worst thing ever is to attend a concert or event and have to drag your parka around like Linus's blankie the whole dang night... our husbands and boyfriends have had enough.\n\nIf you're lucky enough to make your way to the VIP Mezzanine, the view overlooking the stage and entire venue is quite splendid too. \n\nAs some of you know, I am a huge advocate for charitable causes and MMW is committed to making a difference in this arena. Their participation in Yelp Helps was impressive but they don't just stop there...each month MMW will spotlight one local nonprofit organization and collect items and donations at the front entrance during events and shows. To entice attendees to give, they will collect email addresses from those who do to register them for ticket-giveaways at the end of the month. Nurses For Newborns are the current beneficiary. \n\nFor all of you musicians, the state of the art sound system is music to your fan's ears while you entertain us on the over-sized stage which can be seen clearly from any angle in the crowd. I was also impressed with the artist's quarters that include 3 dressing rooms with a full bath area. As a dame who has been stuck in more than a few shotty \"green rooms\" in my lifetime, the accommodations here are like The Ritz Carlton compared to the grime that you all are used to in small to midsized venues.\n\nI'm looking forward to supporting this venue and the emerging Marathon Village neighborhood in any way that I can.", "date": "2011-11-30 22:18:36"}, {"_key": "9996", "_id": "reviews/9996", "_rev": "_fNypmdm--B", "review_id": "COJVzFpDd0i5b3bHowQsFg", "user_id": "5Y5KbsI5buMcNh2hTFaRpA", "business_id": "H8n6Eu17hyp9LHUi4cVN4w", "stars": 5, "useful": 6, "funny": 1, "cool": 4, "text": "Me walking down the aisle in a wedding dress is the furthest thing from my mind but with the abundance of weddings on the calendar as we head into wedding-palooza, I am immersed in the bridal world... kicking and screaming. \n\nWhen a dear friend of mine honored me with a spot in her bridal party and asked for my assistance in finding her dream dress, I may have blushed with happiness a tad.

Why shop at David's Bridal or buy a dress off the rack at a bridal shop when you can have a locally produced limited edition or custom dress for a competitive price? Working directly with the designer means less back and forth with alterations which also means you cut out additional costs!\n\nMy friend is still debating about which dress to purchase out of two final contenders but she is certain that she will never forget this incredible experience.\n\nI will certainly turn to Olia when my time comes!\n\nTIP: OZ also offers Men's custom clothing and suiting for your wedding and beyond!", "date": "2011-03-21 20:46:32"}, {"_key": "11355", "_id": "reviews/11355", "_rev": "_fNypmNe--N", "review_id": "3WOm3eW47R7oJsc_22LxQQ", "user_id": "55SuBikniNRwz4qdF7vLUQ", "business_id": "gOtY7zJ1rIu6UIHXEvh5sA", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Amazing pralines!

The pizza was perfectly flavored and the sausage/peppers had a nice kick to it.  Im sure it would make for great leftovers but unfortunately (fortunately?) for me it was gone well before it found the refrigerator.  The cream puff cream was just awesome - couldn't pin-point the flavor (vanilla?) but I would prefer it to top every dessert I get from this point forward.\n\nI also got a bunch of the other sweets (salted brownie, blondie, red velvet crumb-cake) and a few bagels.  All were good, but not great.  Was pleasantly surprised by the wheat everything bagels - whole wheat bagels usually suck.\n\nWhat I didn't really like was the pepperoni pizza.  It was pretty bland for my liking - in complete contrast to the sausage and pepper pizza - and the pepperoni was pretty sparse. I also didn't like being told 25 minutes, showing up in 25 minutes and then standing there for 25 minutes waiting for the pizza.  The small shop + no chairs = awkwardly standing there for almost a half hour.  \n\nSince it's close to me and has so many tasty looking treats yet to try - I'll surely be back.

Unless you have some animal rights hang-up about it - you should get the soup.  It's probably the best soup I've ever had.  I also tried the pork belly.  It was just okay - almost like a pork belly carpaccio (in texture and thickness).  \n\nThe second course I had the calamari.  In my head I was thinking crispy calamari - just because that's the only calamari I've ever had.  These were large calamari with an almost scallop texture to them.  The salsa verde was good, but I wasn't a huge fan of the calamari itself.  Also tried the salmon which was good - not great.  \n\nFor the third course I had the meatloaf - it was excellent.  Perfectly tender and seasoned.  I also had some of the pasta someone got - it was also very good.\n\nFor dessert I had the pistachio bread putting which was a deconstructed dessert with the ingredients all separated on the plate.

Yes.  I was walking back to my car from ACME, when I spotted a fisherman who was parked and selling his fresh shrimp catch to a chef out on the street.  I took one quick look at his catch and found the most wonderful looking jumbo shrimp I had ever laid eyes on.  Not your standard jumbo, but real JUMBO.  Huge tasty looking shrimp!\n\nI was compelled--even though I had just gorged myself on chargrilled oysters and a po'boy--to inquire about these shrimp of his.  I asked him, \"excuse me, sir, where is the absolute best place to eat those shrimp of yours around here?\"\n\nHis answer: \"Mr B's, you have to try the BBQ shrimp there for sure\"\n\nWho dat?  Mr B's dat.  My convinced my coworker (which wasn't to difficult) to come with me to try the BBQ shrimp.  We quickly sat at the bar, as we had already eaten lunch, and requested an order of BBQ shrimp to share.\n\nWhen the shrimp came to us, and we took that first bite (after peeling the shrimp, of course), we found ourselves in decapod heaven.  They were served swimming (no pun intended) in a delectable buttery/spicy sauce, which was truly amazing.  The smokey and spicy flavors of the sauce were infused into the shrimp, which is truly no small feat.  The best part about a sauce like this is that it seems to build in nuance and intensity with each bite.  Each shrimp, as a result, seemed better than the one just before it.\n\nI was so amazed, that I returned the very next day for another order of BBQ shrimp, to be split with a different friend.  I take great pleasure in sharing the things I truly enjoy with friends, and what better way to do that than over a bowl of BBQ shrimp at Mr. B's?", "date": "2010-10-06 08:18:12"}, {"_key": "13830", "_id": "reviews/13830", "_rev": "_fNypmRW--i", "review_id": "fncYNcoX1kiT3SYsNFjvhA", "user_id": "UmpcBF73osnADg0icnilyg", "business_id": "YMdXDiRiNoKEAFen3XUWFw", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I love a doughnut.

I knew he was on Top Chef, but to be honest, as much as I love restaurants and food, I just can't do cooking competition shows.  They are always on at like 10 pm and they just make me hungry and craving crazy foods late at night.  \n\nHowever, I heard many good things about Sbraga and they were offering a Chef's Counter menu of \"tailgate\" foods.  So my husband and I ventured up Broad St to check it out.\n\nLet me pause a minute and explain how Sbraga works.  So they offer a 4 course meal for $49 pp.  Each course has about 8-10 options to choose from.  However...\n\nMonday through Thursday, at 6 pm sharp, they offer a Chef's Counter menu, which is a set menu with a specific theme and is served at a bar that overlooks the kitchen.  Think of it as a sort of dinner theater.  FYI- there is a maximum of 6 people allowed for this seating.  This option has six courses, as well as an amuse bouche for $75 pp.  A bit pricier than the regular menu, but you get to watch the chefs prepare your meal for you AND they explain each dish to you.  For you Top Chef fans, Chef Kevin explains some of the courses as well.  Super cool.  I felt like Padma that night (hey, I've SEEN the show, I just don't watch it regularly.  Cause it makes me hungry)\n\nUpon arriving at 6 pm sharp, I noticed how classy and chic the interior is.  At 6:01, I realized how awesome their service is.  I was ready to give Sbraga 4 stars, but their service puts them over the edge.  They make their guests feel right at home.\n\nSo how was the food?  Here are the courses and my opinion of each:\n\nAmuse:  Meatballs--- I make some pretty good meatballs, but these blow mine away.  I really liked the sauce- sweet and savory at the same time.\n\nFIRST:  Hoagie Dip--- Hoagie Dip usually makes me a little quesy, but Sbraga's was a delightful fluff of deliciousness.  I could have eaten that all night.\n\nSECOND:  Pepperoni and Beer Cheese Soup--- My favorite thing that we had that night.  A soup made of three things I love?  Yes please!!\n\nTHIRD:  Sloppy Jose--- Chef Kevin brings a latin flava to his sloppy joe by using shortrib and chorizo, and covering it in a spicy cole slaw.  Ole!\n\nFOURTH:  Pork Gyro---  I love Greek food and this dish has a homemade tzatziki sauce that was awesome\n\nFIFTH:  Buffalo Chicken--- Surprisingly, my least favorite meal.  The chicken was a little undercooked and the celery-apple-carrot salad missed the mark for me.\n\nSIXTH:  Brownie Sundae--- I thought I couldn't fit anymore food in my stomach.. until this dish came out.  Brownie, covered with ice cream, bananas, strawberries. YUM!\n\nAlso, the bartender, who was an absolute doll, brought us over complimentary spiked hot chocolate with a dollop of white chocolate liquor whipped cream.  He mentioned that he made the cocoa in case someone did the beverage pairing, but since no one did, he just gave it to us (sans a bit of the liquor.. which was fine by me on a Tuesday night).  How's that for service?  They could have just thrown it in the trash! \n\nOverall, I loved the experience of watching the chefs work (worth the extra money) and while I wasn't blown away by the food, their service and ambiance convinved me to come back and try their regular menu sometime soon.", "date": "2012-12-05 15:12:33"}, {"_key": "4559", "_id": "reviews/4559", "_rev": "_fNypmS2--K", "review_id": "B-7TUHzZyMUsmt5dbUUxlw", "user_id": "RaC8QCJGJu0K3uPsDE0TKg", "business_id": "mcr1lAEdvGLMJhuPwI3I2A", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "In Reno for the night.

It's still down a dark alley off of South Street and in a house (the owners' house) Things have slightly changed- Marrakesh is still dim, and served as a 5-course eat-with-your-hands dinner family style, (as if in Morocco)  surrounded by tons of Middle Eastern decor- runs, lamps, the works. The servers are the owners- a couple who loves to keep it traditional. \n\nI called ahead for seating at 8pm but it seems as though we could have just walked in- we ate upstairs.  You have to ring the bell to get in. We came on Sunday but it was relatively busy- downstairs was full but upstairs not so much. Maybe it was because we were upstairs...but I felt service lacked a bit (we had to ask for water a few times, etc but I couldn't hold it against the one server- the wife). On Fri and Sat, there are belly dancers. \n\nIf you're new to this kind of thing, they do a good job explaining the process. First, they ran your hands through soapy water from their majestic-looking teapot. Next, they explain the menu and ask you to choose between 1 or 2 course for dishes 3 and 4. You don't have a lot of flexibility.. so I am not sure how vegetarians would fare. \n\nWe ate:\n\n1) Course 1- three salads: picked carrots, cucumbers and an eggplant puree- like a babaganoush. This was very tender, salty and good- the others were not as fancy but very tasty. A large tangine looking thing comes around for you to grab pita. The pita is ok- it's not warm, it's not fluffy but you can't win them all (and it's important not to fill up too much on this)\n\n2) Course 2- Very interesting kind of Moroccan...quiche? It's basically a flaky pastry topped with confectioner's sugar that houses egg, chicken, nuts...and some other things. It was overwhelmingly eggy, but tasty. Not my favorite dish but had to give it points for creativity and uniqueness.  The flaky dough was delish- very similar to that of the Green Spinach Pie.\n\n3) Course 3- was our choice between two chicken (chicken with lemon olive oil or spicy cumin)- of course we did spicy cumin! It was fall right off the bone- so tender as I'm sure it was slow cooked for hours. It's also half a chicken so you get the breast, thigh and wing. The sauce was not too spicy, I thought, but the cumin flavor is smoky and present. The sauce is pretty slathered across the meat- and yes you can refill up on pita if you're not into eating meat solo. \n\n4) Course 4- is a choice between beef or lamb and since I don't do red meat, I passed on this. My bf ordered the lamb though and said it was very tender and yummy- and sweet. It was topped with almonds and something else that made it sweet. \n\n5) Course 5- Dessert!  You get fresh fruit and baklava (one piece each). Usually I think baklava is too sweet for me but this one was pretty good- and not too oily. I mean, yes, it was very oily but it wasn't like...drenched in oil. It was pretty flat, cripsy and full of that nutty goodness that you make baklava. Bf said it wasn't nutty enough for him. Again, the flaky dough wins. \n\nThe fresh fruit was also a plus- except our apple was bruised so we didn't eat that. We took our orange for breakfast the next day. There were two strawberries (not really regional, ha) and giant seedless grapes that were almost frozen because it the fruit platter came with a chunk of ice. This was almost like a cornucopia..they really do make you feel like emperor and empress haha!\n\nThe meal is well paced (slow) so you have time to breathe.  They sell only a few house wines by the glass; otherwise you get it by the bottle (there are a few varieties at $30 ish, as well as liquor and the like). My bf got two glasses of red wine- the burgandy. It was actually fruity and full of body, which was a plus. I ordered the traditional rose drink which I actually wouldn't recommend- it was really, really sweet. It was like rose syrup (sweet enough), with sugar and water..it was too sweet and at $5, I was upset I couldn't finish it. \n\nThis place accepts cash only and is $25 per person.

We got the $65 oyster platter which came with 12 huge and succulent oysters, about a dozen each of clams and mussels, 10-12 tails of jumbo shrimp, about half of a huge king crab, 2 small sauce cups of ceviche, and 3 different sauces including a malt vinegar, cocktail sauce, and a spicy mayonnaise dipping sauce, as well as multiple wedges of lemon.  The platter was huge and probably could have fed 3-4 people, though I was able to eat most of it with some help from the fiancee.  The oysters were fresh and delicious and were the star of the platter, while the crab was the not seasoned and somewhat bland compared to the rest of the platter.  Of note, I liked the shrimp as they were steamed with a spicy cajun seasoning which was a nice Louisiana touch.\n\nWe also ordered the fried oyster, bacon, romaine lettuce, and avocado salad which was decent.  The fried oysters on the salad were perfectly prepared, though the bacon was thick cut and a bit on the tough/chewy side (i prefer bacon in a salad to be crispy).\n\nTHE BAD: Service was horrible.  I think we got the worst server in the restaurant; here's the breakdown: His appearance--his long hair made me think he should have been in an 80's hair metal band instead of serving in a moderately upscale seafood restaurant.  His service--inattentive: 1. he never introduced himself before taking our order, 2. he didn't allow us to finish our order as after we ordered our oyster platter he took our menus and walked away and I had to get another waiter/server to order a salad that we wanted to come with our oyster platter, 3.  He forgot our bread, and we didn't realize we were supposed to get bread until halfway through our meal when we saw other tables getting bread, 4. We asked him for lemon with our water and he forgot after multiple queries, and we actually asked 3 different waiter/waitresses/servers for lemon and they all forgot, though our main waiter eventually remembered and brought the lemon to us in the middle of our meal.  The final straw in this terrible haystack was his apathy and rude demeanor at the end of our meal--after taking my credit card and charging for the meal, he walked by our table and threw the credit card/receipt pad so that it plopped on our table and said \"here you go\" and continued walking away like he didn't care.  Overall, it seemed like he did not really care for his job and was there just going through the motions.  I was surprised that a restaurant of Luke's stature hired a waiter like this, as with an appropriate waiter and appropriate service, this meal would have been phenomenal.  Unfortuntely, the service left us in a sour mood despite the quality of the food.  If the service would have matched the food, Luke would have deserved a 4 or 5 stars in my mind, but because of the poor service we received, I gave the restaurant 2/5 stars.", "date": "2014-02-24 03:58:18"}, {"_key": "4561", "_id": "reviews/4561", "_rev": "_fNypmS2--M", "review_id": "DkrsmadeZJj_GERNMIBxVg", "user_id": "LqC5hNXcFVY-jcbyxi-tuQ", "business_id": "Q-prSTdggNlxAEFV88BZOw", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Came here for lunch with my fiancee and friend, found a small table by the window.  they have a great and varied wine selection.
