(There are plenty of delicious falafel spots in the area that quite simply do it better.)\n\nThe drop in rating comes from the \"Express Lunch\" taking 45 minutes to get to the table (we had 8 people, most of whom ordered the Express Lunch, assuming it would be quicker than the regular menu). 45 minutes is not express and not at all useful when lunching on a time limit. It would've been nice if the server had noted that because Express Lunches are served all 3 courses together, they do not come out as prepared (they're held under a heating lamp till all pieces are ready) and therefore it might be faster for a large group to order off the regular menu. We saw other groups (including some of our colleagues) come and go in the time it took for us to get our food.\n\nI still like the space, as it's quieter than many restaurants, so you can hear one another more easily, but this latest experience took a hit on my recommending it for future meals.

The decor is that of a boxing ring/gym. It is very clean with a fair bit of room. It is surrounded by a dozen or more TVs for watching multiple games playing at the same time. Their food is focused on standard bar/pub fare with an emphasis on burgers and fried foods. There is a second lounge area that is still under construction. They intend to have Karaoke there twice a week and possibly a cigar bar. The new lounge has a more upscale feel to it and an impressive bar area.\n\nOn the first visit I ordered the BBQ Burger (I forgotten the name it is under on the menu). It is a 1/3 pound burger patty served with onion rings, BBQ sauce and I believe lettuce and tomato. The burger stands pretty tall, too tall for a human being to eat it. However, removing some of the stacked onion rings brought the height down to a useful level. The flavor was good and despite the heft and wetness of a BBQ burger, the bun stood up to the task and did not fall apart. I had a side of onion rings and they were excellent.\n\nMy second visit was today and I only ordered an appetizer for lunch: the stuffed, deep-fried mushrooms. The site of the mushroom heads was about 2\" across and each mushroom had been cut in half before they were deep fried. I think this diminished the whole \"stuffed\" aspect of the mushrooms as there didn't seem to be much stuffing in evidence. The flavor of the mushrooms was excellent, as was the texture of the mushroom flesh, very firm and moist.\n\nThey do have a pool table, 1 or 2 darts machines and the ubiquitous Touch Tunes music system. The staff is very friendly and I found the service to be prompt. The food took a little time to get out, but I suspect that is simply because the place is new and they are still ironing out the kinks.\n\nI'm giving this 5 stars for a sports bar.

I have a background in cosmetology so I already know how to do hair, but for lazy purposes I like to go to a salon for my own head. I came on a walk in day and was in and out which I liked. The salon was clean and the staff was pretty friendly. A stylist named Erica did my sew in and girl named Chante did my braids. Both lady's did a great job. I really liked that Erica did not leave too much space in between my tracks which some salons tend to do. She also paid a lot of attention to my leave out. Instead of giving my leave out a basic flat iron on top, she took her time and blended it right. You can tell she cares about her work. Will recommend to my friends and will most likely revisit. 4 stars since they charge $20 more for each bundle added after 2. Don't get me wrong I'm not cheap but 3 bundles is equivalent to 2 packs of beauty supply hair if you think about it so thats one charge I didn't quite understand. Nonetheless still a decent sew in for under a $100. \n\n\nNow for an updated review: If you don't care about being in an unfriendly and unprofessional environment, this would be the perfect salon for you. Yes, it is a cheap & affordable alternative than going to other high end salons in the area BUT this place is not what it used to be. I loved this salon before but I'm not sure if the management changed or the stylists just stopped giving a rats ass. For one, when you walk in the salon YOU DON'T feel the least bit welcomed. The receptionist is beyond ratchet. Like BEYOND! From gossiping to outright falling asleep at the desk. Yes, falling asleep! For two, none of the good stylists with the exception of one named Carl even works here anymore. I wish that I could post pictures of how bad my hair came out but since I started taking it out as soon as I hopped in my car I can't. $100.00 down the drain. The stylist who did my hair was named Brandy. Brandy took THREE HOURS to do a sew in. A bad one at that. My braids were loose and bumpy. The tracks were spread so far apart! She had a nice attitude but the poor baby just didn't know what she was doing. She said that she went to beauty school but the only thing she did good was cut my bang. The rest looked absolutely horrible. She told me she had only been there for two weeks and that should have been que to get up.

Taste-wise, my medium-rare burger with goat cheese and egg is comparable to BBP or 500 Degrees. The meat and egg were prepared the way I like it, and the toppings were of high quality, especially the cheese. (Note that the egg yolk is runny! If you don't like that or are afraid of salmonella, let them know.) The only thing I did not like as much was how heavily the hamburger buns were buttered. That was just a little bit too much for my taste, but I know many people who would love the slightly sweet, buttery bun. However, the burger I got was 16 dollars (11 for the burger, 3.50 for the cheese and 1.50 for the egg), which is exactly the price of the burger at Craigie on Main. In case you don't frequent Boston as much, Craigie's is a 'real' gourmet burger where French fries and a small salad are included in the price. At VW, we had to order French fries for 5 dollars on the side, which were delicious and came with a well-spiced ketchup.\n\nI like the atmosphere of the place, and the location which made seating outside more pleasant than at BBP's right on Walnut Street. The service also was excellent (very much unlike BBP). The staff appears professional, they are attentive and fill up your water very regularly.\n\nAll in all, it's a 3.5 - the good burger, atmosphere and service warrant a high rating, but the extraordinarily high price (for what you get) is rather a downer, and I can't give 4 stars to a place where I am unsure whether I'd want to come back. I do like the concept of letting the customer choose their own toppings, which allowed me to choose a combination of toppings you never see but I personally enjoy. On the other hand, the menu of this place is largely uninspired and boring, which in turn is Bobby's Burger Palace's strongest point. If you are in the area, this is probably the highest quality burger + fries you can get - but it comes at a steep price.", "date": "2012-06-26 18:57:00"}, {"_key": "10042", "_id": "reviews/10042", "_rev": "_fM1pi5S--f", "review_id": "kJQ3PenaV3lfavRny0mtPQ", "user_id": "ylPlDjWktCQ4QQLYEG5d-A", "business_id": "YE3E3nFsPo0O7gpMpOL18A", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "text": "You really can't go wrong with this place. \n\nFood is great, prices are reasonable, and you get a TON of food for the price.\n\nStaff is all extremly friendly.\n\nI love comming here, breakfast or lunch, but a personally prefer it at breakfast time, especially on the weekends.

We had very prompt, attentive service.  Get ready, their drink menu is really impressive and extensive!  \n\nFood:  \n\nMe - LGBT Burger - Goat cheese, bacon. \n\nMy son - Daves Smoked - Cold smoked patty, fontina cheese caramelized onions\n\nthe BF - Ozark - mushrooms, black peppered goat cheese caramelized onions\n\nMy son's friend - The Basic - basic burger - +$1 for cheese\n\nAll of the burgers were EXCELLENT.  I can only speak for myself, so first of all, all of our food came out HOT, the buns are made in-house and were delicious.  super tasty, nicely toasted and crispy yet soft - i wanted to take some home with me.  The combination of the goat cheese and bacon with the burger was perfect.  I loved it.  It did not need anything else.  I did put some of the chipotle sauce that came with our fries (separate purchase) and it was pretty good, but not necessary.  Burgers were a pretty good size - they were smaller than the bun, but still a good size.  Worth the price?  Sure, this was a quality burger!  My only gripe, however is that the price did not include fries (see below).\n\nNo one left a morsel on their plates.  My son's friend ate so fast we actually thought he was a little strange...no one should eat that fast...\n\nSides:  We ordered two large french fries ($4 each) to share between four people and it was exactly enough.  You have a choice of \"sauces.\"   I was not impressed at all - they were just fries, and honestly with burgers starting at about $8 these fries should come with the burgers.  I need to have french fries with my burger, so I will pay every time, but suggest that they re-think this item and make them worth the price and at least make something worth the price like  garlic fries.  These are NOT worth the extra $2-$4.\n\nWe also had the Cheese Curds - ok not what I was expecting but it was good.  Not sure what kind of cheese it was but it went really well with the mustard and apples - the bread/crackers however were a nightmare almost funny - they crumbled because they were so thin!  Almost like lace.  They really should be a little thicker.  Again, it was good, but c'mon please be a little more generous with the thickness of the bread/cracker.  \n\nThe boys had ice cream, but I won't comment because I did not taste it.  I was too full from the burger.  Hope to on the next trip.  \n\nOverall, we had a great time.  Service was stellar, the place itself is very cute, but I can see how it may be a little awkward if it's packed, especially sitting at the communal table.

No problem. A small table opened up after about 10 min, and instead of taking us to the table, the waitress led us to the bar. I usually don't like sitting at the bar because I'm short, and this bar was exceptionally tall. When sitting, the countertop came above my chest and I wasn't able to rest my arms comfortably. Who wants to eat like that? We requested to be seated at the table that was just cleared, and she informed us that she wanted to give that table to the family behind us with a child. Okay, fine, I understand that children can't sit at the bar, so we agreed to let them have the table. We let the waitress at the bar know that we wanted to move to the next available table and she said sure, no issue. Another waitress comes by to take our order, we explain our situation, and she comments that if we want to wait for a table, we shouldn't be sitting at the bar, like it's our fault for being at the bar in the first place. She did acknowledge at least that there were plenty of open bar seats at the time, so it was ok for us to sit there \"for now\".

If you move to the table you will have to wait longer for the food to come out.\" At this point, I'm frustrated but I've already invested some time. We tell her (again) that we do not want to sit at the bar, but if waiting for the food is an issue, then can we order now please? They take our order, and after another 10 minutes, we see another open up. Not unreasonably, we thought that would be our table... Until we see the same waitress gesturing to another party waiting at the entrance, letting them know that will be their table. She comes over and tells us that she had already promised that table to them, and asks us again if we're sure we don't want to sit at the bar. At this point, we were so fed up that we just walked out.\n\nI thought that we had been plenty understanding and even let that family go ahead of us, but they were just completely taking advantage of our patience and niceness.

The wait staff is friendly and will help carry your trays, bring you drink refills, etc. \n\nGray's certainly has the best tasting cafeteria food I've ever had. If I didn't go through the line looking at all the options myself, I would have thought someone's grandma or mom was back there serving up all of these home cooking favorites. \n\nObviously, the strawberry pie is iconic. It is good, a little sweet and syrupy for me. I like the sugar cream pie better personally. \n\nAnd again, obviously, the fried chicken is also iconic. But that is finger licking good. Sometimes I opt for the chicken strips because I find them easier to eat - but all of their chicken is tasty. As are all of their meat and fish entrees I've tried. \n\nNow for the sides. THE SIDES. I am a mac n cheese expert, let me tell you, and this is the BEST I'VE EVER HAD. Perfection. I wish I could get that for my entree. \n\nThe mashed potatoes and gravy are great, the green beans are great, the corn is great, heck, even the broccoli is great.\n\nIf I haven't convinced you to come here by now, I'm not sure if it will ever happen.

It was a place where I could take out of town visitors for some really good, fresh fish.  \n\nI was a little disappointed to find out that you go up to the till, place your order and pay for your meal BEFORE you sit at your table.  So here is another situation where if you don't have cash on you, you are expected to tip before you have even had your meal.  \n\nThe one server that they had on staff that night was very rushed and I felt rather bad for her.  We patiently awaited our turn to order.  \n\nYou have a full view of the kitchen so that you can watch your food being prepared if you wish.  It looked like the cook took pride in what he was doing.  \n\nThere were two of us.  We ordered a batch of steamed mussels, the deep fried oysters and the seafood platter.  The oysters and the sampler are deep fried.  \n\nYour meals are at least brought out to your table.  The steamed mussels were served in a red sauce, which I am going to guess had a tomato paste base to it.  The mussels were tender and the sauce was okay but it was nothing spectacular.  As you can see from the photo I posted, you are given a tiny sliver of bread and a single butter pat.  Dadeo's are much tastier.  \n\nThe deep fried oysters were really dark, they looked burnt.  They were juicy though and served with french fries and an in-house made seafood sauce. \n\nThe seafood platter was again, deep fried.  It contained 2 shrimp, 2 scallops, 1 oyster, 1 cod & fries.  This was also served with an in-house made seafood sauce and no tartar sauce in sight!  White and malt vinegar is supplied on the tables.  The cod was overcooked to the point of being mushy and falling apart.  The rest of it was edible, but really plain.  \n\nBillingsgate, you really need to bring the menu ordering back again!  It would have been nice to have more that one beer with my meal and it also would have been nice to have a server to ask for water and tartar sauce.  \n\nI do need to note that the retail side of Billingsgate is quite nice.  The fish and seafood is all on ice in the coolers, or you have several frozen choices as well.  There is live lobster and crab in the tanks ready to take home.

For dinner we split the Spider Crab cause we ain't scared of shh... ok, maybe I was a little....it was huge!!!  The dinner combo, I believe, came with choice of soup or salad.  Splitting the crab was definitely enough for two people. I recall my sister throwing in the towel and me testing my manhood.  My one critique is that I thought the Spider Crab was over cooked.  It by no means ruined the meal and may not be noticed by most but I know my seafood. \n\nOverall one of the best experiences ever.

The booth was very comfortable and we both liked the decor. \n\nWe started off with the buttered fried calamari. It was so-so. The texture was a bit chewy and the breading wasn't very flavorful. The amount we received was also on the light side. I doubt we'll get this again next time around. \n\nFor our entre, we ordered a California roll, spicy tuna roll, the Diga roll and the Eagle roll. All were excellent and the highlight of our meal. The smokey flavor and subtle mix of heat of the Diga roll was incredible. Get it. You won't be disappointed. \n\nThe reason I'm giving this 3.5 stars and not a 4 is because the calamari wasn't very good and their prices are a bit steep for their specialty rolls.

We then ordered our burgers, I ordered the chili-chili bang bang and the Benton's bacon mac and cheese and my girlfriend got the buy the farm and truffle tots. Now here's where things got interesting and the reason why this place gets a 5 instead of 4 from me...... I got my food (which was cooked perfectly and had plenty of flavor) and my girlfriend took a bite into her burger and pulled out what appeared to be plastic from it. We politely told our waitress and she took the burger right back and had them make a new one for us. The manager (I believe, it may have been the chef) comes out and apologized and you could tell he was very remorseful and that this is not a regular occurrence. He explained that the wax surrounding the cheese must not have come off and fixed the burger immediately and triple checked everything again. He even came out with two extra sides of tots and quickly brought her burger back. Then to top off this already incredibly generous gesture, they comped her entire meal for us (which they didn't have to do, for after that level of service I would've been glad to pay full price). We made sure that we still tipped over 20% of the original price of the meal before some of the food was comped for the excellent service.

I had to get the manager to get served. \nThe hibachi chef was one of the least skilled that I have ever seen.  One in our party ordered filet mignon.  He cooked all the dinners at our table, then after he served everyone realized that he hadn't cooked the filet, cooked it and gave it to the wrong person.  My friend didn't realize the mistake.  However, my wife pointed it out to me after we left.  Let me also mention that the place looks very worn and unkempt.  needless to say we will not be back.

The Physician's Assistant came into the room to tell us that my son had definitely broken his finger. He sent us on our way, X-ray pics on a disc, with instructions to follow up with an orthopedic surgeon. \n\nA few days later, we finally got to see the orthopedic hand surgeon at Children's Hospital. Imagine our surprise when we were told by the surgeon that my son's finger was not broken. According to the doctor, the X-ray quality was poor and there was a shadow that was misdiagnosed as a break. My son had a severe sprain with a hematoma and he will recover completely. While I was thrilled to get such great news I was really upset at the quality of care my son received. X-ray technicians are trained to know if the picture is one of good quality.  How many times have you had an X-ray done and the tech says \"let me make sure the pictures are ok before I let you go?\" Additionally, the PA who was reading the X-rays should know when he's reading a poor quality scan. \n\nThankfully, our issue was minor.

After hear one raving review after another, I said enough is enough and took a walk over...and I was not disappointed (except for one minor factor).\n\nUpon walking in the women behind the counter were so sweet and patient. I told them it was my first time and they were more than happy to work with me while I surveyed the entire menu. Eventually I ended up ordering for my dad and I two chicken sandwiches and two cinnamon sugar \"fresh and hot\" donuts, and a cold brew coffee for myself. This is where the one bad part of my experience comes in: the price. These five items came to $21.60, which I believe is quite expensive.\n\nThe cold brew coffee is soooo good. I feel like most places try to nail it down and can never get it right, but Federal Donuts sure did! It had a very robust coffee flavor.\n\nThe chicken sandwich was absolutely delicious; the chicken was juicy with a crispy battered outside, the seasoning was nice and balanced, the touch of sauce was just right, and the potato bun was very fresh.\n\nThe cinnamon sugar donut...just, wow. These people don't lie when they say it's \"hot and fresh.\" It was warm, soft, moist, and loaded with cinnamon sugar. I could easily eat 3-4 of those things in one sitting. At $1.50 a piece you are paying a premium for quality. \n\nDespite the price being a little high, I will definitely be back to try their other varieties of donuts and chicken. 10/10 (or 5/5, according to Yelp).", "date": "2017-06-17 18:15:59"}, {"_key": "10309", "_id": "reviews/10309", "_rev": "_fM1pi5u--V", "review_id": "RgpioT0sE4kxMyVBqmM7gA", "user_id": "s2pYcprdqBd1-swq3kpimg", "business_id": "h4RaM9E8C0d20Uw-nLR5aw", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Great place for kids.

Located off South Street, its entrance is a dark maroon door complete with an iron knocker. Please be sure to come with friends; as other reviews have stated Marakkesh's six course meal really packs a punch. \n\nThe food was mouthwateringly GOOD. I came here with one other person (rookie mistake) on a quiet Thursday evening, and the waiters were very attentive to us. Everything was delicious without being overly oily. For our first main course we ordered the Spicy Chicken in Cumin Sauce, and for the second Tajine of Lamb. These dishes are meant to be eaten by hand, which we did, but I saw some tables eating with cutlery. Full disclosure, the fruits do come with their labels unpeeled, though I wasn't too worried about that because they were the juiciest, sweetest batch I've had since coming to the States. \n\nWe were about to leave when the manager (owner?) emerged from the backroom and told us to stick around to see the belly dancer. I thought this was a really nice gesture, as the dancer had been hired by a large group upstairs and he really did not have to share this information with us.  \n\nMy one critique, if you can call it that, is directed at Marrakesh's decor. True to its Moroccan roots everything from the furniture to the walls is covered with dark, heavy fabric. Perhaps it is a personal bias, but I found the place to be a little stuffy, and I could not tell how clean everything was.

I have a new favorite restaurant in town and Home Wine Kitchen is IT.  The schiznIT, in fact.\n\nWe celebrated my birthday at HWK last night.  Originally, we tried to get into Farmhaus (my other fave resto in STL) totally last minute and were told we could either dine outside (in 102 degree weather?  Huh-uh.) or come in at 8:30, which didn't jive with our babysitting situation.  So I called HWK, which I've been dying to try since I drove by and spied their sweet space on Manchester.  You people in Maplewood are incredibly lucky to have this restaurant in your midst.  Bow low.\n\nWe were warmly greeted by one of the owners, Josh, and heard about a few revisions to the ever-changing menu.  I like a place that refuses to serve a dish due to sub-par ingredients and yesterday the sardines didn't pass the perfection inspection, so they were nixed from the appetizer menu.  No problem for me as I had my eye on the potted pork appetizer, which was outstanding.  The well-seasoned, unctuous spread contrasted nicely with the crisp grilled bread and paired well with pickled radishes, coarse mustard and red onions.  I had a tiny scoop left when the bread ran out and I had it boxed up so none would go to waste.  No potted pork left behind!\n\nSince it's the perfect time of year for stellar tomatoes and glorious, sugary corn, my husband and I were torn between the sides of creamed corn and heirloom tomatoes.  We asked our server if he thought we might be overdoing it if we ordered both sides in addition to our entrees (since we weren't familiar with HWK's portion sizes) and he suggested we'd do fine with just one side... Buuuuuuut, I said it was BIRTHDAY DINNER and how could we pass up two dishes made up of ingredients so absolutely at their prime?  We couldn't.  We ordered the tomatoes and the corn and the chicken and the wild boar.  Thank goodness.  Thank goodness, not because the portions were tiny (in fact, I'd say they were fairly generous and a really good value), but because the FOOD. WAS. AWESOME.\n\nI couldn't help myself when the little cast iron dish holding the creamed corn made it to the table.  I dove right in to the blessed mix of perfect corn, bacon, green onion and leeks and practically shouted to Justin, \"You have to try this NOW!\"  Part of me wishes I hadn't been so exuberant about it--maybe I wouldn't have had to share so much.  But damn, that was one of the finest side dishes I've ever had the pleasure of eating.  Ever.  I almost wept with joy.\n\nThe heirloom tomatoes, noted as having thyme, honey and balsamic components on the menu, also arrived in a cast iron dish, which surprised us--I think we were expecting a cold, more salad-like dish.  Don't mistake that for disappointment, though, because these tomatoes were also delicious.  Roasted, sweet and juicy, they tasted like the best fresh, chunky tomato soup you can imagine and the bright yellow, orange and red tomatoes just looked cheery.  Does that sound silly?  Probably.  I'm still giddy from this dinner; indulge me here.\n\nJustin had the wild boar shoulder for dinner, flavored with cumin, orange and currants, slow-cooked in wine and served with fragrant basmati rice.  The boar was topped with orange gremolata, if I'm not mistaken--a mixture of garlic, parsley and orange zest--and Justin was just blown away by the flavor combination.  He said it reminded him of a dinner we shared at Rick Bayless' Topolobampo in Chicago, which, if I had to guess, would probably be rated as his #1 dining experience in his 32 years, so this is really high praise for HWK.  It really was delicious.\n\nI had the chicken entree--a perfectly seasoned, crisp skinned, juicy breast and wing accompanied by arugula, bacon and these surprisingly amazing fingerling potatoes.  I was just shocked by how crisp (not burned; crisp) the outsides were and how creamy delicious the insides were.  The arugula gave them a nice nutty taste and the bacon added a nice saltiness to the dish.  I chose wisely.  And I about licked my plate clean.\n\nI was beyond full at this point in the meal and should've passed on dessert, but I was intrigued by the stone fruit dessert with orange cream.  To be fair, I couldn't eat much more of anything at all, but this was the only item of the night I wasn't head over heels in love with.  The fruit was poached, I believe, with some spices, giving it that Christmas-y, mulled wine sort of taste.  I know lots of people who love that, but it's not my favorite.  Maybe I should've tried the goat cheese tart with honey and pistachios, but I thought its richness might totally put me over the edge... Maybe next time. :)\n\nI enjoyed our server, who was knowledgeable, friendly and efficient, and I loved getting to chat with the owners, Josh and Cassie (who is also the chef).  They've done incredible work on the space and made it a unique, intimate place.

Very friendly staff and bartenders are very attentive to the guests at their rail.\nMoving on...Parking in the area is a challenge small streets don't help either. I understand it is something out of there control but when developing a restaurant your seating calculator is based on parking spots available. This will let you use areas more productively and efficiently. Also it is very confusing where the front door is or where guests are to come in. The signs in the back just make things more confusing. We would have enjoyed sitting outside the weather was not too bad but with properly placed fire pits you could take advantage of all your patio seating.\nOn to the menu, limited but great because of the size of the establishment and very well priced. The selections were good and diverse which is key to satisfying a variety of palettes but...if you offer small a menu everything that comes out should be perfectly cooked and should taste as good as it looks. I had the pork chop unfortunately it was cooked to a med rare. I do like my pork medium but rare is wrong. My wife had the salmon which looked slightly overcooked but she was fine with it. My friend had the bone in rib eye which was cooked well but as far as taste you can tell it was choice grade and lacked a beefy flavor many look for when ordering that cut. His wife had the tilapia and she did not eat it at all! The breading was soggy and tasteless and was non-visually appealing. Too many bland colors on the menu plate presentation is everything! If it looks good it taste good! \nAlso we noticed the menu doesn't offer a description of your sides which this technique is usually used in ala carte menus. I am sure your mashed potatoes are a staple to your menu, but it's important for your chef to check potatoes often through the night because they will brown and become gummy if not maintained right as mine were no good. All of us who received the side of vegi's we received cold and very wilted and over cooked. \nThe last item is we never saw a managers presence we had a food issue and no one came to our table to follow up with us.

We got the $65 oyster platter which came with 12 huge and succulent oysters, about a dozen each of clams and mussels, 10-12 tails of jumbo shrimp, about half of a huge king crab, 2 small sauce cups of ceviche, and 3 different sauces including a malt vinegar, cocktail sauce, and a spicy mayonnaise dipping sauce, as well as multiple wedges of lemon.  The platter was huge and probably could have fed 3-4 people, though I was able to eat most of it with some help from the fiancee.  The oysters were fresh and delicious and were the star of the platter, while the crab was the not seasoned and somewhat bland compared to the rest of the platter.  Of note, I liked the shrimp as they were steamed with a spicy cajun seasoning which was a nice Louisiana touch.\n\nWe also ordered the fried oyster, bacon, romaine lettuce, and avocado salad which was decent.  The fried oysters on the salad were perfectly prepared, though the bacon was thick cut and a bit on the tough/chewy side (i prefer bacon in a salad to be crispy).\n\nTHE BAD: Service was horrible.  I think we got the worst server in the restaurant; here's the breakdown: His appearance--his long hair made me think he should have been in an 80's hair metal band instead of serving in a moderately upscale seafood restaurant.  His service--inattentive: 1. he never introduced himself before taking our order, 2. he didn't allow us to finish our order as after we ordered our oyster platter he took our menus and walked away and I had to get another waiter/server to order a salad that we wanted to come with our oyster platter, 3.  He forgot our bread, and we didn't realize we were supposed to get bread until halfway through our meal when we saw other tables getting bread, 4. We asked him for lemon with our water and he forgot after multiple queries, and we actually asked 3 different waiter/waitresses/servers for lemon and they all forgot, though our main waiter eventually remembered and brought the lemon to us in the middle of our meal.  The final straw in this terrible haystack was his apathy and rude demeanor at the end of our meal--after taking my credit card and charging for the meal, he walked by our table and threw the credit card/receipt pad so that it plopped on our table and said \"here you go\" and continued walking away like he didn't care.  Overall, it seemed like he did not really care for his job and was there just going through the motions.  I was surprised that a restaurant of Luke's stature hired a waiter like this, as with an appropriate waiter and appropriate service, this meal would have been phenomenal.  Unfortuntely, the service left us in a sour mood despite the quality of the food.  If the service would have matched the food, Luke would have deserved a 4 or 5 stars in my mind, but because of the poor service we received, I gave the restaurant 2/5 stars.", "date": "2014-02-24 03:58:18"}, {"_key": "10533", "_id": "reviews/10533", "_rev": "_fM1pi6G--_", "review_id": "8xbkdpnuIOzAl_Mh8powNw", "user_id": "OVhs0e7t6Ap2kkzsIQULUQ", "business_id": "i2yCrMQx5soH0jMFG32vxQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Such great customer service!!

Most times when I order a certain menu item, they charge me the lunch price because I order a smaller portion. Depending on the day and the server, the price changes every time. Most recently I ordered only a child's cheese quesadilla, nothing else. I was charged full price for an entire kids meal. I was told when I questioned it that the \"manager\" made him charge me that way. Also on a separate occasion we were way overcharged for margaritas.

The brisket is best when dipped in the Guasacaca (avocado based salsa) which lends a brightness to the rich brisket.   After, we tried the seafood paella which was full of seafood and sausage.    Everything was tasty, though the buffet suffers some due to the lack of traffic as the temperature on some dishes wasn't ideal.  This is anecdotal, but deserves mentioning.  \n\nWe did speak with the owner after eating and he shared his background.  He couldn't have been nicer, and did allow us to try a few items off the day's menu (the empandas are not to be missed).

Its just that every time i came to visit them, he had other stuff going on so i never got to hang out.  But this time, I was hanging out with him and was determined to make a good impression.  \n\nThe only problem... my friend knows WAY too much about me :)  And knew that when she said, \"I'll get a drink if you have one\", i would get the sangria.  Which was delicious!   Different, but highly delicious...as was her mai tai.   Then was the pressure to order the \"Bloomin Onion\".  Which is awesome, but greasy and gross, but still amazing.  But not something i want this guy i've never met to see me chow down on!  \n\nAnd rather than ordering a steak, which i really was not in the mood for, i opted for the \"Bloomin Burger\".  MORE BLOOMIN ONIONS!   The burger was thick and juicy and perfectly cooked.  It was topped with cheese and bloomin onions!  Very good.   It came with fries, but i was so full i couldn't even finish them.  \n\nWe almost ordered the \"chocolate thunder from down under\" for desert, but i think my friends husband was concerned about his own chocolate thunder from down under!  \n\nThe food was good and we called ahead and got on the waiting list to be seated at 715, yet we were seated at 6:50, so that was nice.

Heck yeah!). The menu is extensive and interesting, with unique twists on classic dishes. The service is also great, but I am withholding a fifth star due to the management's seating policies.\n\nWe came for brunch on a Sunday expecting an hour plus wait, so when the hostess informed us it would be 1hr45m we weren't surprised. However, we became frustrated when we noticed there were 4 open tables on the patio that still hadn't been seated after an hour of waiting. It was a beautiful day so we asked the hostess about it and she said that the tables were reserved. When we asked again, she explained that the patio tables were not assigned to a specific server but were instead added on to a server's load inside, so they weren't seating them because they didn't want to overwhelm the servers. Totally understandable to not want to overwork your servers, but why not seat people with the caveat that service will be slower? Or better yet, why not specifically assign a server to the outdoor section so that wait times will be lower? Having worked in the service industry, our group was confused by this. We ended up just sitting at one of the empty patio tables until the hostess notified us that a table was ready. \n\nWe ordered the Cheddar Biscuit, the Wood Fire Double Yokes, and a Turkey Feta Omelette from the specials board and all were delicious. The biscuit comes in a trio and though it doesn't look like a lot of food they are VERY filling. Our server surprised us with a side of White Trash Hash on the house because our food was taking longer than expected (we didn't even notice the timing, so it was a very nice gesture). The White Trash Hash is a must, this stuff is addicting! Potatoes, rice, and gooey cheese- who could ask for more.\n\nOverall, great place for brunch in Nashville.

If everything works out good we're going to Belize, Mexico and Honduras. We booked the trip about a month ago and this is her first time at sea during the Christmas holiday.\n\nSunday, Day 1 - Our room was a mess! The windows were so dirty my wife decided to clean them off herself. The chairs were covered in salt and when you sat on them the salt transferred on to your clothing. Then after walking in and out of the room we noticed that salt and dirt was tracking in to the room. We finally called  down to the front desk and they sent someone up to clean it off. We hold gold cards so that means we sailed at least 25 days but less then 75 and never have I've seen such a dirty ship. Dinner was OK, we are in the cafeteria not the dining room. The kids had pizza and I had chicken, again dinner was OK. \n\nMonday, Day 2 - The weather was nice so we played in the pool, kicked back in the Adult only area and I drank as much as possible. A big BBQ lunch out on the lanai deck with Ocean views! Dinner was an absolute disaster. It was formal night and it took us over an hour to get our food. There was six of us at the table and our ribs were cold and the corn was burnt. The pasta was not very good,how do you screw up pasta. Just about everything felt and tasted like it's been sitting for a long time. We complained but zero customer service!! The comedy club was awesome. Also, midnight room service was good. BLT's and cookies!! \n\nTuesday, Day 3 - another day at sea where we did the same thing we did the day before. The BBQ again was awesome. Pools were fun and we played cards inside and listen to all the trivia games because it got a little windy outside. I was hoping to avoid any negativity today but I have to tell you breakfast absolutely sucked. The eggs were very runny, the French toast was BAD and the eggs Benedict was not very good. Other then that it was a fun day at see. We ended the night at the comedy club and it was so much fun!\n\nWednesday, Day 4 - we arrive at an island off the coast of Hunderus and it was beautiful. The town where the ship parks is very pretty from the ship, however, you soon find out that the area they drop you in is owned by Carnival. Everything is for rent, everything is for sale and everything to me feels FAKE! The sand, the trees, the buildings and even the food. My kid said that the french fries were the same as the ones on the ship. So here is what you do!! Get a cab to the West end of the island. You will see most of the island driving there. The best snorkeling is on the West end and there is plenty to see and do. We got back on the boat, took lots of pictures and had dinner again back in the dinning room. Again it was disappointing and we said that tonight is the last night. The staff is not good, the food is bad and we are extremely disappointed. We're talking 3 generations of people, Grandparents, parents and kids that are 9 & 17. Carnival if your listing, you have a problem. Keep in mind people I was on another ship two weeks ago. The food was great!! So we ended the night watching a movie out by the pool on the big screen and it was awesome!!\n\nThursday, Day 5 - We arrived in Belize and there are a lot of fun things to do. If you can't snorkel, take the kids to Old Belize, check out the picks, the place was great!!  Dinner in the dinning room again! The food was really good tonight but the service was really slow. Comedy club after dinner was fun and a little piano bar to top everything off.\n\nFriday, Day 6 - Cozumel Mexico was a blast. We got off the boat early and we were one of the last ones on. Dinner in the dinning room again just sucked. This boat is just too big for the food and service to be as good as other ships I've been on. We watched a movie outside under the stars and enjoyed our last night with warm weather. \n\nSaturday, Day 7 - Day at sea, BBQ on the Lani deck again was great. Trivia, corn hole and another movie on the big screen under the stars. No dinning room tonight, it sucks we have to tip them. I discovered that the chicken quesadillas that room service offers may be the best I've ever had. Our bags are already outside and we are ready to disembark.  \n\nThe big ships are fun but service is sacrificed. What really sucks is that Carnival does not have the roads or the channels in place for a guests complaint to get heard by a person that has the ability to make a change. Policies and procedures are in place and rarely does change occur. This was my 4th cruise and my least favorite by far. The destinations were great, the ship was beautiful and the employees for the most part will bend over backwards for you.", "date": "2015-12-20 22:15:39"}, {"_key": "10582", "_id": "reviews/10582", "_rev": "_fM1pi6K--G", "review_id": "I1RzLPs-q3SelAXqKCQy-Q", "user_id": "GltpBXG2dCiMvi-bxvJPHA", "business_id": "PY9GRfzr4nTZeINf346QOw", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "The Pepermill is one of my favorite places.

It's a small place, so any table you get is a good one. This is one of the few places on Frenchman Street that seems okay for children: mine are 9 and 11 and very capable of behaving well in a gastropub setting. The menu has a great baked mac & cheese and the waitresses are warm and welcoming. I have to say, after sampling the fish tacos, I sorta wish that I had ordered the mac & cheese, too! The tacos were okay but small and pretty bland. The mac & cheese was plentiful and well-seasoned. But this place is all about the music and the drinks, and on these they won me over. Had a simple Stella Artois apple cider (despite the great drink selection) and hubby enjoyed his porter. If you make a reservation, they give you 90 minutes to dine, which to me was more than enough. The band starts at 7pm on a weeknight, taking a 15-minute break around 8pm, and our 7:30 reservation gave us plenty of time to enjoy the music.

First, Cheu is a small location. There are only three tables crammed into a small nook which should onlyt. Second, VERY limited seating. Therefore, this place does not offer reservations, except in extreme cases, and seating it fills up fast. \n\nHowever, the food does come out at a fast rate so I cannot see why anyone would want to eat, relax and talk for a bit. The noise level is rather loud and the music does not help in that aspect. \n\nBesides those little annoyances, Cheu does offer delicious ramen that is worth the wait and crammed area. The secret lies in their small menu that is precise and allows to make ramen a specialty. I tasted ramen from other restaurants and the menus tend to be huge; lots of combinations, food seems rushed and put together; but not here. \n\nThe slices of brisket in my ramen was lean and non-fatty and the broth was absolutely delicious. Cheu does offer apps as well but you can feel up on the ramen alone; but if you must try an appetizer try the Garlic Wings or/and the Pizza Dumplings.\n\nBack to the ramen! I added an soft boiled egg that perfectly complemented the noodles and a Spiked Juice w/ Rum to top it off.

I was thinking about veal since I knew that Italians really do make it best.  My husband and I stopped in to make a reservation for later that night and the host was very friendly and said \"We don't have anything open until 8:30pm\" but that was no problem for us and we just strolled around the surrounding area and stopped in a few shops while we were waiting.  At 8:15 we came back and our table was ready.  We sat down and were promptly served a nice cool glass of ice water.  My husband ordered an Italian Kiss which is some sort of espresso mixed drink.  He said it was out of this world.  A few minutes later we were served some delicious Italian bread and butter.  The bread was wonderful.  We then placed our order after looking over the menu.   We got the escargot as our appetizer.  This was absolutely wonderful!   My husband knew he wanted the Seafood Pescatore.  I decided to have the Veal Marsala and a side of meatballs.  We enjoyed our bread until our meals were brought out.  Now my Veal Marsala was hands down the best dinner out I have EVER had.  The veal was tender, the mushrooms were delicious, and the sauce,  well I think I had dreams about it that night.  My husband's dinner was also wonderful.  He used to prepare this himself and was surprised at how fresh and tender the mussels were .  He said he would get that again.  Now the meatballs are something you HAVE to get if you go to Ralph's!!!  These were nice and firm and the gravy was wonderful!  After all this good food we had to finish off the night with a cannoli.  My husband and I both ordered one and got one to go for my Dad.  Well those were crisp and the filling was the best i've ever had!    We will be returning to try more of their food.

Make sure to sign up for the reward program as you'll have free wifi and a ten dollar credit for either the mini bar or the bar downstairs. The hotel is also pet friendly which is a great option for those traveling with pets. A few issues that did arise during our stay. The bed is very firm, so be aware of that if you have issues with that type of bed. Also, parking is by valet only and costs $50 which is quite steep. If you don't mind the walk, there is a parking garage, Bourse, about a block and a half away which only charges $28. There are also no garbage bags in the room which can be quite annoying when you're traveling with pets. There was also a dog on my floor which kept barking for about five hours straight numerous nights in a row. The hotel staff did not seem to be able to handle this situation, except to call my room asking me to control and handle my dogs which were silent.

I had to get my children passports and it was about time for me and HubbyStanks to renew. Since the only appointment we could get closer to home was during a school day we decided to walk in. The gentleman who I spoke to on the phone about the walk in was nice enough to let me know about arriving before it opens if I want to get things done without the longest wait. \n\nWe got there at 8:15 and already there were people waiting outside with numbers. How nice that a postal worker came out and passed out numbers to the early birds. When it opened we were number 29! Although there were only 2 lines working at a time, the men behind the desk would give a person paperwork if they didn't already have it filled out, call the next number, then ask if the last number was ready. Wow! You won't find that at the DMV or any other government office. \n\nAnother gentleman came from the back to ask if there were any renewals and since HubbyStanks and I were renewing he took care of our paperwork without us having to wait for our number. We then sat back down with our kids. When it was our kids turn our postal guy, who was retired navy, was so cool, cheerful and friendly. He made us smile and we even talked about different Naval bases that we lived.\n\nHubbyStanks realized he needed to expedite his passport so we went into the main post office to retrieve our mail and make the change.

It was a pretty fantastic hotdog, born of a stroke of genius. It was called the Mango Kimchi dog. The perfectly cooked dog, producing a Randy-Savage-snapping-into-a-Slim-Jim loud thunderclap with each bite, was topped with: spicy kimchi, mangos, sweet bean paste, and crispy rice noodles. HUH? Well, it worked, and it was awesome. And at only $5, I'm not sure how they even covered their R&D costs (which must have been formidable).\n\nAs the old saying goes, every day has its dog (or something).", "date": "2013-08-16 14:25:16"}, {"_key": "10632", "_id": "reviews/10632", "_rev": "_fM1pi6O--Y", "review_id": "K2LXvZrJUHkOHTTTVv-ECQ", "user_id": "_nlsafpaDtKWS5PI9rdCdQ", "business_id": "CYJRj0lF120-WC3UKsuh5A", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Fiorello's is awesome!

Omnomnom.\n\n- Goat Pishwari - I'd never had goat before, but it was great - I highly recommend it.  The meat was tender and the sauce was good, but not quite as great as the Nihari.  I would definitely order goat again, but I'd probably switch it up and try a different goat dish.\n\n- Chappati.  This was a type of flatbread that I'd never had before - I don't remember it having a distinct flavor, but the texture was good and it was great for mopping up sauce.\n\n- Garlic Naan.

We were fine with tap water, which was served European style-- lukewarm with no ice.  Since it was 83 degrees outside with 70% humidity, we found this unsatisfactory and had to request ice.\n\nWhen we asked about the tasting menu, we were told that the serving sizes were very small and we should get something else.  I find it obnoxious that a restaurant advertises a special and then when you get there they try to convince you not to order it!  \"It will never satisfy you!\"  Then why are you selling it!?  If the answer is \"bait and switch\", then it's  a fake deal.  It tells me you don't want repeat business.\n\nEveryone else in my party ordered something else, but I stuck with the tasting menu.  After all, that's why I showed up.  True to the waitress's warning, the three dishes which comprised the tasting menu failed to satisfy.  There was a tiny crudo (raw whitefish with rock salt) paired with a heavy red, a tiny mushroom pizza paired with a sparkling rose, and a thick piece of toast with a thin layer of prosciutto paired with a riesling.  In that order. \n\nThe flight of wine was lower quality, didn't pair well with the  food, and the servings were miserly splashes.\n\nThe crudo was so over-salted that I had a hard time eating it and it made no sense with the red.  I'd just started on the mushroom pizza when the waitress dropped by to ask if everything \"tasted wonderful\".  I said that the mushroom pizza was nice, but that the fish was too salty.  She replied, \"here, we love our food salty\".  I don't think that insulting your guest's palate is a great customer service technique.  \n\nTo sum up, the tasting menu, far from being a chef's calling card, an opportunity to experience something fun and creative, was a half baked and poorly executed marketing exercise-- and a terrible value to boot.    No one else in my party was particularly impressed with their dishes either.  The phrase \"not bad but overpriced\" came up a lot.

I think the bitters were forgotten and the orange zest was just a small piece of torn off skin. The glass had a single large ice cube, but they brought out the bourbon in a decanter filled with small ice cubes. It was barely anything more than very very watered down bourbon by the time it was poured.

We also ordered 3 starters for the table. Spicy shrimp dish (can't remember the name), tuna ceviche and edamame.  Its is really hard to mess up edamame, so that was okay. We did not finish the ceviche, it had no taste at all. The shrimp starter was the high light of the meal. Very good!  My seafood salad was really sad.  I felt like a rabbit eating dry vegetables. I told my server that I wanted to change my dressing to just plain lemon and olive oil. The salad came out with no dressing at all. My friends ahi tuna was pretty bad. Just did not taste fresh and the sauce for dipping was bland. My other friend enjoyed his chicken sandwich. I have two things to say. 1-they seemed to have put more attention into the way the food looked on the plate then the flavor of the food.  The plating was above average.  2- if you go, try to stick to basic dishes that are hard to mess up,  for example there seared ahi tuna dish was a disaster, but there grilled chicken sandwich was good.  Anything on the menu over $15 stay away from.   I most likely will not return unless I hear that they have consolidated there menu and changed the flavor profile to most of there dishes.

The second floor has the boxing ring, squash courts, a basketball court, and aerobics rooms. The third floor is the main fitness gym, with a lot of workout machines, ellipticals, treadmills, rowing machines, and free weights.

We first encountered TCB/Sabrina for a lactation class. Before even signing up for the prenatal class, I spoke with Sabrina on the phone. She was incredibly helpful, getting me resources for doulas and advice about how to obtain support through the whole birth process. We signed up for the prenatal series but were only able to make it to the breastfeeding class b/c our son came early. The class was great and I can only assume that the rest of the prenatal class would have been just as good. Sabrina helped put me in touch with an inpatient nurse at UCSF where we were going to deliver to discuss the possibility for pre-expressed breast milk if my baby was to need supplementation, etc. She went out of her way to get us the help that we needed. But, then the real magic started with her assistance. I ended up having severe preeclampsia and delivering my baby a month early. We were having trouble with breastfeeding in the hospital and I sent Sabrina an email which she replied to and offered her assistance, along with advice and help obtaining a hospital grade pump. She then came over to our home the day after we were home from the hospital. From that day forward, she was available weekly at my house and by email and phone. We had a particularly difficult time with breastfeeding. My baby boy was  a month early, had totricollis, and was tongue tied. Sabrina walked us through all of this and helped us at every step of the way, from softly suggesting a dentist to release his tongue and lip tie, to urging us to get cranio-sacral work on a weekly basis, to lending us a scale to weigh our boy. For two months, he would not breast feed and then he learned to latch! Sabrina was still by my side teaching me how to transition from my comfort zone of measuring out all of his ounces to trusting that he was getting enough directly from my breast. My baby boy never went hungry the whole time he was learning and never needed supplementation beyond my breastmilk. Some of the most important things that are special about Sabrina is that she supported what I wanted, but she was also clear about getting nutition to my baby. Lots of moms who have trouble with breastfeeding and who desire to exclusively breast feed, run into the problem of under-feeding their baby, which causes problems in the long run that are much worse than supplementing with formula. Sabrina watched the growth of our baby boy closely to make sure that he was always getting enough and made sure that my supply was developed well so that I always produced enough. The second thing that is special about Sabrina is that she is a LC who supports whatever mom's want. She alters her plans according to family wishes. She also was very cognizant of my emotional state and making sure that I was taking care of myself. This is really important because it is difficult to want to breastfeed and to have to pump and bottle feed while trying to teach your baby to latch. It takes about 20 hours/day and is painful work when he/she is not able to latch. Sabrina kept checking in with me to make sure that I was still emotionally holding up. In the end, it worked out for me. He is now exclusively breastfed and we were even able to travel to Maui for 5 days where he breastfed on the beach and at waterfalls. It was glorious and everything I ever hoped for in a breastfeeding relationship with my son. I am now transitioning to work and Sabrina has been there as a support through phone consultation. As a physician, I think it is incredibly important to have this kind of support. I only wish that our health insurance--public and private--supported this kind of consultation because for some cases, like mine, it was absolutely necessary, and Sabrina and TCB were there every step of the way.

So, the MA who came in and asked me questions was cool, personable.... My blood pressure was insanely high, which I have never experienced before (168 over 135) and I got panicky, as the alarms and crap were dinging,... The MA definitely recognized my concern, and listened pretty well. \nThe Dr came in and I went  thru my list of symptoms and he totally blew me off, I  said even the fact my blood pressure was sky high wasn't a bit alarming,....He said no, I have anxiety. Made me out to be a hypochondriac, which totally isn't the case, I've fallen off rooftops and walked junk off like the queen of england. He then asks are you tired...Yeah I'm tired , I work full time in a hospital and waitress part time, and I walk like a million miles a day, but I feel crappy now more so than usual.\n\n He palpates my belly and asks a few more questions, then says well I think you may have mono.... But there isn't much we can do about that.... I asked if he could run an epstien barr heterophile blood test to see...He said it wasn't neccesary. Um....Ok. \"Tthere isnt much that we can do about that anyway\"... Great. He says I strained my wrist. I'll get you an ace bandage....Well what about the mono possibility....ande the fact my blood pressure was insanely high....Once again he gives me this look like listen you dirty little tattooed hood rat...you have no idea what your talking about..... \"Your a perfectly healthy twenty seven year old. Your fine. You have anxiety problems, you checked off depression on your chart.....\" Um. Ok. So I then wait half an hour for an ace bandage while the chick runs around bitching how they don't have any supplies, never can get anything done....(reassuring) I mean, to be fair, I probably could have gotten a better physical at my apartment considering I have a broken wheelchair,a blood pressure cuff, a buncha vacutainers, some cough syrup, and part of a trach tool kit (don't ask me and my brother work in healthcare,....and kinda hoard stuff...) So I finally get my ace bandage and ask the girl if she can take my blood pressure...SHe says she can't find a stethescope. I ask a dr passing by if he can and he pretty much laughs in my face.\n\"Aren't you leaving?\" \nUm, ok.\n\"why do you want your blood pressure checked?\"\n\"Because it was insanely high when I came in on the machine, and I was hoping a manual read would prove different\"\nSo, in less than good humor, he pretends like he's checking my pressure (I know how to use a blood pressure cuff, he didn't set it on the right numbers or place the stethescope in the correct area....) He says \n\"It's like 110 over 90. Why, do you feel ok?\"\nWhatta mess.

It's usually not worth the effort, and if I don't like a restaurant I simply won't go back. But this place... my goodness. Easily one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had. \n\nOrdered the Veggie Benedict, but asked if I could have it with egg whites. The server was puzzled and said that it already came with egg whites. Ok no big deal, it was strange that it wasn't listed that way on the menu but whatever. The server comes back a couple minutes later: \"It does come with normal eggs! All this time I thought poached eggs meant egg whites.\" Uh, ok. A bit odd for a server at a restaurant that literally specializes in eggs, but still not an issue. She asks if I do indeed want the egg whites, and I say yes. A couple more minutes pass, and she comes back. \"Our kitchen doesn't know how to poach egg whites, so if you want them they'll have to scramble them.\" What?? You poach an egg white just like you poach an egg. But whatever, I don't care that much so, \"Sure, that's fine.\"\n\nIt took us a very long time to get our food. The restaurant was not busy. Empty tables, no wait.\n\nFinally our food comes out, and what do you know it's cold. Not just room temp. Cold. We mention it to the server who proceeds to tell us it's because the restaurant doesn't use heat lamps because \"they have so many hands.\" Apparently not enough hands to get the food out within a half hour, and to get it out warm. \n\nOn to the food itself. I ordered what should've been a relatively healthy, easy meal. I got a plate that was literally covered in so much oil that my bennies were swimming. We're talking greasier than the greasiest Chicago pizza, but not due to fat from sausage or cheese. Oh no. There is no reason it should've been greasy at all, since all it had was spinach, wild mushrooms, asparagus, and tomatoes. It was literally just vegetable/canola oil. Even the side salad was drowning in its oily dressing. It was to the point that my own mother commented that if it had been her food, she wouldn't have touched it. We're not picky eaters; we eat anything and everything. So I proceeded to try some of my cold, oily concoction and unsurprisingly it tasted like nothing. It was so oily that none of the flavors of the vegetables could come out, and left my mouth, lips, and even fingers shining. And the hollandaise... oh god. What should've been a nice lemony-buttery sauce was a blob with the consistency of expired box pudding. Skin and all. And it tasted like nothing I've ever had before... maybe similar to cheese wiz? The stuff in a can? Yeah. \n\nWith all of the other brunch places around (Wild Eggs, Yolk, First Watch, Le Peep) there's no reason anyone should go to The Egg & I.", "date": "2017-11-18 20:47:43"}, {"_key": "10762", "_id": "reviews/10762", "_rev": "_fM1pi6a--k", "review_id": "xM6AfuyhOqPvNQLM0Fgdkw", "user_id": "8-FzOAPGgGmfyCTyrUNw7w", "business_id": "bXjnfT69E8DJinX-ifOofA", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "My family and I have been going to this restaurant for a few years now and my parents are very good friends with the owner, Eddie and his wife, Mary.

So, for the good & bad...\nVenue floorplan is HORRIBLE! It's long and narrow, which means the majority of attendees cannot even get a glimpse of the stage.

The Over-21 lounge upstairs looked nice. But, again, good luck trying to see anything.  I was lucky, though. There was a small group that went together & a couple of them let me wiggle up to the rail so I could see the bands play a few songs. The bar and bartenders up there were great!

As we strolled we listed off our choices trying to make the decision as we walked...East Girard Gastropub, Kraftwork, Frankford Hall, Interstate 295...all good places to which we have already been. But as we passed each one they all looked like sardine cans. Instead of sardines they were packed with humans. Humans that smelled worse than fish in a can. So, we kept on. \n\nThen we passed Lloyd and decided to give it a try. My girlfriend loves whiskey,  the menu looked interesting, and it was busy, but not filled to the gills. So, in we went. \nMy immediate reaction to the decor/ambiance was that it felt like an upscale VFW. The bar is adorned with mismatched stuffed armchairs (cozy!) and fun vintage wall art that has a cabin in the woods and/or dark pool hall feel. There was something just a little off on the overall vibe. I got the sense that the owners had a limited budget to dedicate towards the design and decor. Maybe it was the startlingly white acoustical grid ceiling, or the Pergo floors that make that dreadful hollow knocking sounds when you walk across them, or maybe it was the off-the-shelf white folding residential closet door covering what I assume was a storage closet. This sounds overly nit-picky, but when I think \"whiskey bar\" I imagine a dark, dimly lit, cozy space with dark (real) wood accents and leather. Also, it lacked a good seating area adjacent to the bar. A overly wide space between the tables and bar felt like an unused dance floor. \n\nBut enough about the design of the space. Now to the important part. The food.\n\nI got suckered into some special cocktail that was made with a whiskey that aged for 6 months in some special aged oak barrel. It was yummy, but at $13 a pop - I didn't go for another round. For food bits we got roasted beets in a siracha honey glaze, chicken liver mousse pate with bread, and a mozzarella & prosciutto with broccoli rabe sandwich. I loved the beets and the chicken liver. The sandwich was  good, but basic. There wasn't a crumb left on any of the plates and the servings were pretty generous.  The two cocktails my ladyfriend had were also super yummy, and a much more reasonable $9 a piece.\n\nOverall I enjoyed my experience. The service was very good, the food hit the spot. I would go back again to try their other offerings. I only dwell so long on the ambiance of the place because I think they have a good thing going, but in a town like Philly where there are so many good restaurants with great atmosphere and design, a restaurant has to do more than make good food to survive long term. I hope this place continues to do well. It's great having another quality place to go to in Fishtown.", "date": "2014-02-05 23:17:37"}, {"_key": "10771", "_id": "reviews/10771", "_rev": "_fM1pi6e--E", "review_id": "PYNlNf3LHZpRiaXG5yPv5A", "user_id": "KsTA7_Ps9NucN-VAjy4GOA", "business_id": "dBCNUSbz5-8nQNrxWo5deg", "stars": 5, "useful": 4, "funny": 3, "cool": 3, "text": "Blue sage ROCKS.  It's a shame it's so small, as it makes it NOT a good choice for one of those Friday nights when you're like \"hey, why don't we...?\"  But, I'll forgive it for its smallness and move on to my fav things there.\nThe first time I ever went there like 5 years ago, I got the El Fino Wrap (it's this wrap with poached pears, gorgonzola cheese, toasted (i think) pecans and maybe some dried cranberries and onion?), and I almost passed away it was so amazing. To this day it's still my favorite thing there, and in my top 5 favorite foods on earth.  They don't have it on the dinner menu though, but you can always order it.  THAT is my ultimate fav.\nIn terms of soup - they are like soupmakers from the future.  Flavor combos I've never heard of warm ginormous bowls. The thai carrot soup makes me want to live in Thailand and become a carrot farmer.  They drizzle this creme fraiche on top and.... yeah.  You get it.  I also had this really awesome beet soup there... Which reminds me...\nThose crazy cooks at Blue Sage are like Masters of the Beet.  In fact, I was not aware of the degree at which I adore the beet until I'd seen it cooked/utilized about 5 different ways there. It's awesome.\nThen it's like, okay.... What else could they do to be Awesome McAwesometon?  Oh, they could have world-class desserts (w vegan options too) that make you want to setup a little cot and just live in their dining room.\nSo, obviously, I love this place.\nOne more thing - I prefer Blue Sage for lunch.  The options are there, it's cheaper, and they actually have more stuff I like on the lunch menu.\nDInner gets a little too grainy for me - literally.

Most Thai restaurants I've visited have been a little smaller and more intimate, and this place gives you enough breathing room.  Coming from Chicago, my favorite place near the UIC Campus was Thai Bowl on Taylor St.  Cheap and good Thai food with a student discount and delivers to the dorms.  \n\nThe food was great, and having a Thai friend order food that I wasn't familiar with was all the better.  I'm more of an \"eat what you know\" type of person, and sometimes I'm scared to venture out.  But the Tom Kha (sp?) - Coconut (Milk) Soup was delicious.  I have to say I'm not a fan of either mushrooms or coconut, but I have to say it was a great combination.    Now to my usual order of Pad See Ew, I wasn't too impressed.  It seems like this place, along with Smiling Elephant and Royal Thai, all make their Pad See Ew with thinner (almost transparent) noodles.

Nice relaxing time but terrible food.  Eggs looked and tasted like they had been held for a while after being cooked, not at all fresh. Salad on one plate had more dressing then salad, really inedible. What I did notice was the complete lack of bacon or sausage or anything pork related. Odd for a brunch, but maybe gypsies don't eat meat?\nThe other thing I found was 1. It was 40 degrees in the bathroom, really really cold. 2. The wall next to our table really needed painting, or at least washing, food splatters and grease stains on the paint were really unappealing. The cute puffy wall coverings looked like someone used them as napkins over and over.  A tremendous disappointment after many really great experiences at Southern Cross. \nIt seems to me they can do a lot better, or close the place for a rehab. \nWe felt pretty ripped off with brunch, though the live music was awesome. Maybe dinner is better, breakfast is really hard to do well after all but I doubt we will ever find out as we have no intention of returning.

It's owned by the same folks who own the amazing South Street Flowers a few blocks down -- so they are experienced at doing business in the South Street corridor. Located a few doors down from Whole Foods, and across from a Starbucks, and Percy Street BBQ, they fill in a retailing gap left by a very lackluster Ritz Camera and just may help draw the crowds up South Street a little further. \n\nDecor is bright, eye-popping lime green, white and orange-colored, high-style furniture make for an upbeat decor, with super-sized fruit photo light boards, and a wall of sleek stainless yogurt soft serve dispensers. You take a cardboard cup (only a large available at opening) but fill it with however much, or little, of their various enticing flavors as you like. (You pay by the weight.) Just ask, and they are glad to pull out tiny shot cups for you to sample flavors. (Could use tiny wood or plastic spoons, or you need a very long tongue, to get the full taste of the samples. They provide larger, plastic teaspoons with your purchase.) \n\nOn our opening day visit the flavors included intense Mango, Blueberry, and the tangy Original flavor. Also Peanut Butter, Chocolate and Cappuccino were among the more flavorful offerings, plus vanilla, and a half dozen other flavors I can't remember. Between my husband and I, we must have tried at least 8 flavors and loved them all. Chocolate and Blueberry were our favorites, but that may change on the next visit. \n\nAfter getting your cup filled with your selections of yogurt (or just one flavor, if you're that single-minded) you move to the toppings bar where no fewer than 20 toppings can be had from small bins, or tubes. There were standard kid-appeal: sprinkles, chopped up hot pink sugar wafers, crumbled chocolate chip cookies, and gummy candies balanced by more adult toppings of dried fruits, crushed nuts, fresh strawberry puree (which I loved over the blueberry, strawberry, Mango mix I enjoyed) and so many more I can't even remember. \n\nThere is both cafe table seating in lacy lime plastic chairs, or higher counter seating along the 9th Street window. Given the owners' other business venture down the street, it is no surprise there are beautiful fresh flowers throughout. \n\nAs I watched each person come through the line and make their own little bit of a mess -- as folks do -- I also saw the staff right behind them straightening and cleaning things up so each customer gets a fresh Berry Sweet experience. \n\nMain criticisms are few but essential: they must add napkins (if they were available, they were completely hidden and not offered at checkout even), add an easily accessible posting of nutritional information (especially being near Whole Foods, people are allergy and diet conscious), and a water cooler with small cups would be a welcome addition. Add a recycling bin next to the trash bin for plastic spoons, or use wooden spoons. \n\nBest of luck to this lovely little yogurt oasis. For now, open 'til 11pm.

I knew he was on Top Chef, but to be honest, as much as I love restaurants and food, I just can't do cooking competition shows.  They are always on at like 10 pm and they just make me hungry and craving crazy foods late at night.  \n\nHowever, I heard many good things about Sbraga and they were offering a Chef's Counter menu of \"tailgate\" foods.  So my husband and I ventured up Broad St to check it out.\n\nLet me pause a minute and explain how Sbraga works.  So they offer a 4 course meal for $49 pp.  Each course has about 8-10 options to choose from.  However...\n\nMonday through Thursday, at 6 pm sharp, they offer a Chef's Counter menu, which is a set menu with a specific theme and is served at a bar that overlooks the kitchen.  Think of it as a sort of dinner theater.  FYI- there is a maximum of 6 people allowed for this seating.  This option has six courses, as well as an amuse bouche for $75 pp.  A bit pricier than the regular menu, but you get to watch the chefs prepare your meal for you AND they explain each dish to you.  For you Top Chef fans, Chef Kevin explains some of the courses as well.  Super cool.  I felt like Padma that night (hey, I've SEEN the show, I just don't watch it regularly.  Cause it makes me hungry)\n\nUpon arriving at 6 pm sharp, I noticed how classy and chic the interior is.  At 6:01, I realized how awesome their service is.  I was ready to give Sbraga 4 stars, but their service puts them over the edge.  They make their guests feel right at home.\n\nSo how was the food?  Here are the courses and my opinion of each:\n\nAmuse:  Meatballs--- I make some pretty good meatballs, but these blow mine away.  I really liked the sauce- sweet and savory at the same time.\n\nFIRST:  Hoagie Dip--- Hoagie Dip usually makes me a little quesy, but Sbraga's was a delightful fluff of deliciousness.  I could have eaten that all night.\n\nSECOND:  Pepperoni and Beer Cheese Soup--- My favorite thing that we had that night.  A soup made of three things I love?  Yes please!!\n\nTHIRD:  Sloppy Jose--- Chef Kevin brings a latin flava to his sloppy joe by using shortrib and chorizo, and covering it in a spicy cole slaw.  Ole!\n\nFOURTH:  Pork Gyro---  I love Greek food and this dish has a homemade tzatziki sauce that was awesome\n\nFIFTH:  Buffalo Chicken--- Surprisingly, my least favorite meal.  The chicken was a little undercooked and the celery-apple-carrot salad missed the mark for me.\n\nSIXTH:  Brownie Sundae--- I thought I couldn't fit anymore food in my stomach.. until this dish came out.  Brownie, covered with ice cream, bananas, strawberries. YUM!\n\nAlso, the bartender, who was an absolute doll, brought us over complimentary spiked hot chocolate with a dollop of white chocolate liquor whipped cream.  He mentioned that he made the cocoa in case someone did the beverage pairing, but since no one did, he just gave it to us (sans a bit of the liquor.. which was fine by me on a Tuesday night).  How's that for service?  They could have just thrown it in the trash! \n\nOverall, I loved the experience of watching the chefs work (worth the extra money) and while I wasn't blown away by the food, their service and ambiance convinved me to come back and try their regular menu sometime soon.", "date": "2012-12-05 15:12:33"}, {"_key": "10875", "_id": "reviews/10875", "_rev": "_fM1pi6q--A", "review_id": "KUUe58vahSOBtSgN7yOECw", "user_id": "GkVEBdhdm7yLPxD_UCZKvA", "business_id": "tSiBAxQ5YuVA2m9PGIJXbA", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Terrific local business with excellent service.

So background to how we came up to this place.  Came here with my boyfriend when we were in Philadelphia for a business trip. The place is small and cozy. When we got there, it was 9pm and had been walking around in 20degree weather, so we were down for something warm. Here is where half a star leaves the rating. The hostess did not look like she wanted anyone coming in. She had a little attitude when she told us to stand by the ramen wall. When seats were available, the hostess took her sweet time cleaning up despite people waiting to be seated.  I understand the place is a little cramped but it does not take 10mins to clean a table, especially if the table is literally 3x3. The waiter and waitress were wonderful and after we had ordered I was watching the chef cook.  The other half star for the following: The entire time the chef was cooking, she would pull her phone out and text. That's disgusting! She wasn't wearing gloves also. The chef is picking up up ingredients with her hands that she just used to text and puts them into the bowls they're serving! Now onto the food. My bf and both got the miso ramen with the spicy bean paste as an add on. The broth was good but after adding the spicy bean paste and mixing in the egg, it got creamy and even better.  If I was back in Philadelphia, I might consider coming back but probably if it was a last resort.", "date": "2015-02-16 23:05:14"}, {"_key": "10991", "_id": "reviews/10991", "_rev": "_fM1pi62--B", "review_id": "mh3kqaJJ6ISCyoXnAHtRKg", "user_id": "xcHRv038Y1rMVGUY1VNibw", "business_id": "g_0U8kzf5iTMJ-I9E3MWlA", "stars": 1, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I went to the drive thru hopefully I can get served so was at the speaker for half hour and lady had a attitude cause we asked if we could get service to say they had to change till and several cars left in the process I had to go home hungry that was totally sad luckily I not a diabetic", "date": "2018-02-24 05:30:31"}, {"_key": "10992", "_id": "reviews/10992", "_rev": "_fM1pi62--C", "review_id": "9YCmyqbC57eN8o04bZRqSQ", "user_id": "xQT2u-i36B2I9NCgINAr8Q", "business_id": "1skzWN0fxGgZNRE53Y_3gw", "stars": 5, "useful": 4, "funny": 0, "cool": 4, "text": "Finally made the trip to the unsuspecting spot where Perennial resides. What a gem!  Based in the bottom of a refurbished Coke factory that now houses loft apartments, this place is awesome. As soon as we walked in, the bartenders gave us a friendly greeting and asked if it was our first time - indeed it was!  She then went through the menu and all the beer options available that day.  My husband and I both opted for a flight of beer to find out which one we liked best. My winner was Midnight Rambler, a dark full-bodied Belgian Stout. Mmmmm, mmmmm, good.\n\nTo pair with our beers we ordered the charcuterie plate and the pumpkin humus. Both were spectacular but the pumpkin humus blew my mind! I am a fan of all things pumpkin and it makes so much sense to use it in humus. It also came sprinkled with pomegranate seeds on top which gave each bite a tart, acidity to it. I am drooling right now just thinking about it. \n\nOur experience at Perennial could not have been any better. The beer, the food, the service all five star worthy. Oh and we got to chatting with a group of home brewers who traveled up from Memphis to try the place, very cool.   Got some great tips to use for our future home brews.  This place is a winner and we can't wait to go back to try and get our hands on some of their famous Abraxas beer next month!!", "date": "2013-10-24 14:23:05"}, {"_key": "10993", "_id": "reviews/10993", "_rev": "_fM1pi62--D", "review_id": "IRd1cRblEt-ClI09j2b5sQ", "user_id": "N4S9oqo1U6MpUbTeY8EY6g", "business_id": "_NfEP6cuFSz7bd-7OtiJ-Q", "stars": 3, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "nice inexpensive eat. very casual great place to spot for a bite at all hours", "date": "2015-04-01 19:13:27"}, {"_key": "10994", "_id": "reviews/10994", "_rev": "_fM1pi62--E", "review_id": "ioIkE7OwnmWE_KTAFLdKIw", "user_id": "oKLZQ2srAtzNvlCW-a6DTA", "business_id": "4bxby6xcP1iP8oXrdvsW7w", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Fabulous!!!
