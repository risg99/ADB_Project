I have a new favorite restaurant in town and Home Wine Kitchen is IT.  The schiznIT, in fact.\n\nWe celebrated my birthday at HWK last night.  Originally, we tried to get into Farmhaus (my other fave resto in STL) totally last minute and were told we could either dine outside (in 102 degree weather?  Huh-uh.) or come in at 8:30, which didn't jive with our babysitting situation.  So I called HWK, which I've been dying to try since I drove by and spied their sweet space on Manchester.  You people in Maplewood are incredibly lucky to have this restaurant in your midst.  Bow low.\n\nWe were warmly greeted by one of the owners, Josh, and heard about a few revisions to the ever-changing menu.  I like a place that refuses to serve a dish due to sub-par ingredients and yesterday the sardines didn't pass the perfection inspection, so they were nixed from the appetizer menu.  No problem for me as I had my eye on the potted pork appetizer, which was outstanding.  The well-seasoned, unctuous spread contrasted nicely with the crisp grilled bread and paired well with pickled radishes, coarse mustard and red onions.  I had a tiny scoop left when the bread ran out and I had it boxed up so none would go to waste.  No potted pork left behind!\n\nSince it's the perfect time of year for stellar tomatoes and glorious, sugary corn, my husband and I were torn between the sides of creamed corn and heirloom tomatoes.  We asked our server if he thought we might be overdoing it if we ordered both sides in addition to our entrees (since we weren't familiar with HWK's portion sizes) and he suggested we'd do fine with just one side... Buuuuuuut, I said it was BIRTHDAY DINNER and how could we pass up two dishes made up of ingredients so absolutely at their prime?  We couldn't.  We ordered the tomatoes and the corn and the chicken and the wild boar.  Thank goodness.  Thank goodness, not because the portions were tiny (in fact, I'd say they were fairly generous and a really good value), but because the FOOD. WAS. AWESOME.\n\nI couldn't help myself when the little cast iron dish holding the creamed corn made it to the table.  I dove right in to the blessed mix of perfect corn, bacon, green onion and leeks and practically shouted to Justin, \"You have to try this NOW!\"  Part of me wishes I hadn't been so exuberant about it--maybe I wouldn't have had to share so much.  But damn, that was one of the finest side dishes I've ever had the pleasure of eating.  Ever.  I almost wept with joy.\n\nThe heirloom tomatoes, noted as having thyme, honey and balsamic components on the menu, also arrived in a cast iron dish, which surprised us--I think we were expecting a cold, more salad-like dish.  Don't mistake that for disappointment, though, because these tomatoes were also delicious.  Roasted, sweet and juicy, they tasted like the best fresh, chunky tomato soup you can imagine and the bright yellow, orange and red tomatoes just looked cheery.  Does that sound silly?  Probably.  I'm still giddy from this dinner; indulge me here.\n\nJustin had the wild boar shoulder for dinner, flavored with cumin, orange and currants, slow-cooked in wine and served with fragrant basmati rice.  The boar was topped with orange gremolata, if I'm not mistaken--a mixture of garlic, parsley and orange zest--and Justin was just blown away by the flavor combination.  He said it reminded him of a dinner we shared at Rick Bayless' Topolobampo in Chicago, which, if I had to guess, would probably be rated as his #1 dining experience in his 32 years, so this is really high praise for HWK.  It really was delicious.\n\nI had the chicken entree--a perfectly seasoned, crisp skinned, juicy breast and wing accompanied by arugula, bacon and these surprisingly amazing fingerling potatoes.  I was just shocked by how crisp (not burned; crisp) the outsides were and how creamy delicious the insides were.  The arugula gave them a nice nutty taste and the bacon added a nice saltiness to the dish.  I chose wisely.  And I about licked my plate clean.\n\nI was beyond full at this point in the meal and should've passed on dessert, but I was intrigued by the stone fruit dessert with orange cream.  To be fair, I couldn't eat much more of anything at all, but this was the only item of the night I wasn't head over heels in love with.  The fruit was poached, I believe, with some spices, giving it that Christmas-y, mulled wine sort of taste.  I know lots of people who love that, but it's not my favorite.  Maybe I should've tried the goat cheese tart with honey and pistachios, but I thought its richness might totally put me over the edge... Maybe next time. :)\n\nI enjoyed our server, who was knowledgeable, friendly and efficient, and I loved getting to chat with the owners, Josh and Cassie (who is also the chef).  They've done incredible work on the space and made it a unique, intimate place.

To which, my server responded, \"Sure...we have a house roast, dark roast, or a vanilla flavored?\"\n\nAre you kidding me?  A breakfast place with coffee OPTIONS?  And, one of those options is DARK roast?  Color me caffeinated.  I promptly ordered their dark roast which came poured out of a carafe left at the table.  Plus, they have flavored creamer (bonus!).  This was definitely not your usual (awful) diner coffee.  It was dark and delicious.\n\nFortunately, my dining companions were familiar with the menu and HIGHLY recommended the Salmon Eggs Benedict.  Always a fan of anything including hollandaise sauce--I went for it.  My people!  Perfection.  Here's the thing, when you smother something in hollandaise, you can easily be lazy in the preparation of what comes UNDERNEATH the hollandaise.  I mean, it's going to be smothered in all that lovely, buttery deliciousness--who will notice?  I will notice, people.  I will.  And, there was definitely nothing lackadaisical about the preparation of this dish.  The salmon, even without the hollandaise, was moist and flavorful.  The eggs were perfectly, beautifully, delicately poached.  It was the single best Salmon Benedict I've ever consumed (possibly the best Eggs Benedict in general!).  \n\nThe Benedict came with a side of home fried potatoes, which had a light peppery flavor that I quite enjoyed.  The service was spot on--prompt, attentive, and friendly.\n\nOne final note I have is the menu:  The menu is expansive.  If you have family and/or friends in town with diverse tastes--this is a wonderful option for breakfast.  They have all your classic selections covered (bacon & eggs, chicken fried steak, various scrambles).  They have the sweet (pancakes, stuffed french toast, waffles, crepes).  And, they've got your savory (An entire list of various Benedicts, skillets, and classic to creative omelets).  I can't imagine anyone NOT finding something they'd enjoy.\n\nPlus, I was informed they have an entire gluten free menu.  Not merely the slight modification of items on their regular menu--but an entire menu of creative gluten free options.\n\nGet to it!", "date": "2014-10-11 18:39:04"}, {"_key": "11160", "_id": "reviews/11160", "_rev": "_fNypmNK--K", "review_id": "zjiu21eljTv2fElJMoiKLg", "user_id": "H32QTRV87Q6CGTVUm1Z4QA", "business_id": "HXNnAl94bXuhBJjP0jPL2A", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "More of a legitimate toy store (like, for children) than a toy store aimed at adults (no, not THAT kind, I mean the goofy sort with stuff that you can find in the Archie McPhee catalogue).

Not only do you get to eat authentic Moroccan cuisine, you get to enjoy a cultural experience as well. \n\nYou may have walked past Marrakesh or the surrounding streets many times without even realizing it was there, like I had prior to this visit. It's nestled on Leithgow Street just a notch off of South Street. Forget South Street or even the rest of Philadelphia for that matter. You are about to step into a different world. To enter you must ring the doorbell on the side door. \n\nI felt more like I was going to a house, than a restaurant; especially with the shower located in the restroom on the second floor. During my entire visit, I never felt like I was at a restaurant. I felt comfortable and relaxed. Maybe eating with your hands with a towel on your lap has that effect. \n\nI found my group of fellow Yelpers in a cozy private room.  The room had four tables with booth seating along the outskirts of the room. Ottoman like chairs took up the rest of the space for the rest of us. With such a large group in not the largest of spaces, it got loud.\n\nOur meal started with customary hand-washing and we were even entertained twice with a belly dancer. After placing our order, the food kept flowing. The service was probably the most unobtrusive service I've ever had. As one dish was placed in front of us, another was seamlessly removed. I felt like royalty or at least someone enjoying a nice meal at someone's dinner party. The regular dining formalities I'm used to were thrown out the window, and it was fantastic! \n\nAs I'm sure you're aware, this $25 prix fixe menu has seven courses and you are welcome to BYOB. While it was a ton of food, I walked in the door absolutely starving and walked out not overly stuffed. I believe most people left absolutely full, so maybe the tip is to come in extremely hungry. Here's a little rundown of dining experience:\n\nCourse 1: Three-Salad Platter- The eggplant is phenomenal (and messy). Luckily you have some assistance from the pita to eat it. The cucumbers and bell peppers and carrots and cucumber were good, but the eggplant stole the show. \n\nCourse 2: The B'stella- As someone who doesn't normally love sweets but loves cinnamon, carbs and meat, this dish was a winner. This dish was dough filled with chicken, nuts, almonds, egg, peppers and onions. It was really hot at first, but once you cracked open the shell and let it cool down, it was easier to eat. I had some pita saved from the first course, so I found it easy to break off a piece and rest it on the pita while it cooled down. Truly a sweet-savory delight. \n\nCourse 3: Chicken- So here's where the choices began. You can either get chicken with lemon or spicy chicken. My group opted to get the spicy chicken with the cumin sauce on the side. The chicken was melt in your hands and then melt in your mouth good. The spicy sauce had a nice kick without being overly spicy to me. I still had some pita leftover so I did a little dipping with the sauce. \n\nCourse 4: Beef or Lamb- My table got a little creative here and asked for half portions of both the beef and lamb. The beef was served shish kebab style, and to be honest, not my favorite. It was a little well done, and I struggled a little to get it off the stick resulting in a pepper flying into my husband's wine glass. Sauvignon blanc tastes best with a little pepper anyways, right? The lamb was perfect. Even the non-lamb eaters thought it was delicious. It was tender and took on the flavor of the chick peas and onions without having an overwhelming lamb flavor. \n\nCourse 5: Couscous with veggies, chick peas and raisins- This was probably my least favorite dish from the main meal. It was a little blander than other couscous dishes I've tried in the past. I would have been disappointed if this was the only thing I ordered, but everything was a hit thus far in the evening. They did give us spoons at this point, so don't worry about eating the little grains with your hands.\n\nCourses 6 & 7: Dessert- I'm assuming the tea, fruit and pastries count as the sixth and seventh courses. At this point in the evening, my bottle of wine had been consumed and I wasn't counting the dishes, and am making this assumption while referencing the menu. I'm not a tea fan so I passed. The pastries were little crisp triangles that reminded me of baklava. The fruit came out frozen was a little hard to eat. I nibbled on a strawberry and took a banana for the road since the majority of the group passed on the fruit. Perhaps the fruit was customary, but I thought a little unnecessary. If it's part of the traditional meal then no harm, no foul.  \n\nTo sum it up, I had delicious food and hours of fun. It's an experience not to be missed in Philadelphia, especially if you go with an adventurous group of friends. While I couldn't imagine going to Marrakesh every Friday night, I can definitely pick a handful of occasions that would be a perfect fit.", "date": "2015-07-28 15:31:21"}, {"_key": "11541", "_id": "reviews/11541", "_rev": "_fNypmNu--i", "review_id": "lfS_gAXNySdKERe_N1Q7og", "user_id": "IyIsFkVY48JWa01inv-7zA", "business_id": "tH10ZuH28GrccqTZ6TTl7A", "stars": 3, "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "We have gone on several Carnival cruises from the port here.

Instead, I will rank them 1, 1a, 1b, 1c:\n\nTop 4 French Toasts:\n\n1. Blue Moon Caf\u00e9 in Baltimore (1621 Aliceanna St, Baltimore, MD 21231): The Cap'N Crunch French Toast tops my list. Grinding cereal and using it to create a crunchy crust is genius. I also enjoy the fresh fruit on top.\n\n2. Blu Jam Caf\u00e9 (7371 Melrose Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90046): The Crunchy French Toast features a cornflake crust. It also has berries on top. I slightly like the Cap'N Crunch French Toast better because I enjoy the Cap'N Crunch crust a little more.\n\n3. Surrey Caf\u00e9 and Juice Bar: The Banana Foster's French Toast is on par with both. I give the other two the thinnest of margins because I love the cereal crust. Nevertheless, the banana cream and Banana Foster sauce is an equalizer.\n\nI also ordered a side of home fries. The potatoes had excellent seasoning and a nice crunchy skin. In addition, Surrey is a juice bar. I had a fresh squeezed orange juice. Is a large, 16 ounce juice really worth $6.50? Personally, I would not normally pay for it. However, I wanted to try a fresh juice since I saw great reviews for them. It was very good. Nevertheless, it is a lot more than I would want to pay for juice. I got to Surrey at 8 AM when it opens. The place is great so the seating will fill up quickly. On a Sunday, it was almost full by the time I left at 9 AM.\n\n4. Stanley Restaurant :Surrey's Caf\u00e9 and Juice Bar have a slight edge with the toast and Fosters sauce. However, Stanley's additional toppings (bananas, banana chips, and vanilla ice cream) and beautiful presentation is an equalizer.\n\nIf you are visiting New Orleans and looking for recommendations, please see If you are visiting New Orleans and looking for recommendations, feel free to message me through Yelp and I can share my itinerary, which includes my Yelp reviews.

These were thick-cut, rich in taste [gratis the duck fat, one presumes], not actually greasy, but definitely better when ordered with the cup of cheese sauce on the side. \n\nWe also got soft pretzel sticks, which would have been fine but not especially remarkable without the mustard sauce (which had a distinct taste of raspberry, to my mind) pooled in the cup underneath them.\n\nOverall, this was a friendly place with fab drinks and great food.

For what they seemingly lack in a way of app and entree selection they more than make up for with the quality, care, and innovation of their offerings.\n\nI landed after a long day of travel, famished. My lovely host, Brit S, picked me up from the airport, and after situating myself at the Conrad, we hopped the whole two blocks over to the Libertine.\n\n(It should be noted that former Indy CM Jon A also highly suggested checking this place out.)\n\nThe space is long and lean, with a formidable bar set-up and bottles for days behind the bar. Bitters and fruit and tinctures and all that, you know the drill at this point. The \"kitchen\" is also behind the bar, and the whole thing is grey and low light and trees/antlers and candlelight and warm and really nice smells. It sort of reminded me of a less formal Hinterland (located in MKE). Employees rock the whole Stumptown coffee look, but they're not nearly as in yr face with it as Stumptown is.\n\nOh, yeah. I was telling a mildly entertaining story with linear progression, wasn't I? \n\nSo: I was *famished,* and wanted nothing more than to start w/ one of their amazing cocktails, but knew I needed to put something in that stomach of mine first.\n\nSo... to the eats.\n\n1. A beet salad starter which Brit and I shared. Goat cheese and spinach and beets and yup, you guessed it. So so good, as beet salads can be when they're done right. Then?\n\n2. A chanterelle mushroom & fresh vegetable pot pie. Oh my god, I can't even. I love chanterelles, I love pot pies (secret favorite thing), so... you get the idea. Clearly handmade with fresh ingredients, I couldn't stop eating it. It was effing delicious. I was full, and yet, I kept eating. So so good.\n\nThe rest of the bites on the menu were on that whole gastro tip with an emphasis on the more foodie-focused. (God, I still hate the word foodie. I really do.) What I mean? I don't remember seeing offal or brains, but along those lines for sure. Marrow, elk, etc.\n\nAnyways, moving on (and this is important).

This is the most impressive and promising brewery in Santa Barbara. \n\nInside they have a high ceiling, exposed wood rafters and black underlayment with an array of chalkboard panels for the tap list.

The list looked inspired with a range of styles from sours, Berliners, stouts, pilsners, and IPAs.\n\nThey offer very nice tasting flights, which our group did. You grab a draft list and just tick the ones you want to try. This system takes a lot of work and annoyance out of the process - a great idea. The beer quality was a bit all over the place, which is expected from a new brewery. However, some showed a lot of promise and I think Third Window has what it takes to improve their recipes.

This was my absolute favorite of the beers I tried so I got a large pour in a giant mug. \n\nBrett Saison\nLooking beautiful in the glass, glowing neon yellow with generous carbonation. The aroma is sawdust, barn, candied mango. The flavor is bubbly, neautral, and very dry but not abrasive. Refreshing, though a tad washed out in the flavor.\n\nRakau Welch\nLooking identical to the Brett saison but with a more impressive aroma with fresh corn grits, lemongrass, dill, fennel, oregano - super herbal. The flavor is dry, neutral, refreshing. The farmyard character of saison is spot on here. Simple, dry, but not abrasive.\n\nXexo\nSuper dry for an IPA that wants to deliver sticky caramel aromas and flavor, but the palate is way too washed out and the bitterness becomes abrasive. Needed some work. \n\nThe \u00d6KO BOMB\nInky black in color, but much too thin a body for stout. The nose is savory chocolate mousse, big raisin, chocolate covered raisin. But the flavor is too dry and moves to grape soda, grape cough syrup and tootsie roll.\n\nExecutioner's Daughter\nClear amber in color. This one had intense vinegar (acetic acid) and nail polish remover (ethyl acetate) in the nose. Taste is very nice, however, with cinnamon, mild sugar, dark bread, banana nut bran muffin.

Because of that, you might suspect people are sniffing cocaine due to their boisterous attitudes, but after eating beignet's at Cafe Beignet on Bourbon Street, I'm convinced that they are the reason for such things. Lol\n\nCafe Beignet offers better beignets than Cafe Du Monde and it's not even close.  They're far more fluffy, soft, well-sized, and deliciously powdered than any beignet I've had and it's only $3.99 for three!\n\nCafe Beignet has two locations--one being this one inside Musical Legends Park on Bourbon Street and the other on Royal.  I much rather prefer the one on Royal as it has a more clean and endearing environment.  This specific location on Bourbon is more fun and lively, but the distasteful smells of Bourbon Street creeps in from time to time.  I do love the live jazz music that is played though.  \n----\nConclusion: Those who are looking for 5 star beignets and a lively, musical atmosphere, come to this outdoor location.  I, along with Mr. Alton Brown (famous food critic on the food channel) agree Cafe Beignet is much better than Cafe Du Monde.  Come here for food, alcohol, music, and the best beignets! can be found here too!  \n\nExtra Notes:\n-Accepts credit card\n-Tables are available but be aggressive when trying to obtain one.

But a small cooking accident and a burned hand lead me to order out at this South Chinese/Vietnamese place, and I was pretty satisfied with the result.\n\nMy order was hot and freshly ready in just under ten minutes; I barely had time to hit an ATM around the corner. It wasn't super cheap; I paid for two dishes what I would have paid for three at the cheapest of such places, but the portion sizes were such that I'll get 2.5-3 meals anyway, which is about right for the price. And it was respectable American Chinese cuisine, with my Kung Pao dish highlighted by a mix of vegetables and a decent amount of peanuts, and my lemongrass tofu having the option of noodles or rice with a little salad and separate sauce on the side. Nothing world-beating (and if I wanted to, I could get mad at them for their spicy dishes not being particularly hot), but I got a good meal.\n\nFor some reason it came in styrofoam containers rather than the typical Chinese food cartons, and I was instructed to hold the bag level to avoid spillage; even being cautious, there was still a bit of sauce on the bottom of the bag. If they wanted five stars from me, they could do things like improve those containers or not sneak broccoli into dishes where it isn't listed or offer non-soy vegetarian dishes for variety, but their menu now isn't bad.\n\nTheir online menu proudly proclaims that the dishes in its vegetarian section are \"prepared with vegetarian ingredients\", which sounds redundant until you realize that Chinese places can and will sneak in something that isn't.

It's still down a dark alley off of South Street and in a house (the owners' house) Things have slightly changed- Marrakesh is still dim, and served as a 5-course eat-with-your-hands dinner family style, (as if in Morocco)  surrounded by tons of Middle Eastern decor- runs, lamps, the works. The servers are the owners- a couple who loves to keep it traditional. \n\nI called ahead for seating at 8pm but it seems as though we could have just walked in- we ate upstairs.  You have to ring the bell to get in. We came on Sunday but it was relatively busy- downstairs was full but upstairs not so much. Maybe it was because we were upstairs...but I felt service lacked a bit (we had to ask for water a few times, etc but I couldn't hold it against the one server- the wife). On Fri and Sat, there are belly dancers. \n\nIf you're new to this kind of thing, they do a good job explaining the process. First, they ran your hands through soapy water from their majestic-looking teapot. Next, they explain the menu and ask you to choose between 1 or 2 course for dishes 3 and 4. You don't have a lot of flexibility.. so I am not sure how vegetarians would fare. \n\nWe ate:\n\n1) Course 1- three salads: picked carrots, cucumbers and an eggplant puree- like a babaganoush. This was very tender, salty and good- the others were not as fancy but very tasty. A large tangine looking thing comes around for you to grab pita. The pita is ok- it's not warm, it's not fluffy but you can't win them all (and it's important not to fill up too much on this)\n\n2) Course 2- Very interesting kind of Moroccan...quiche? It's basically a flaky pastry topped with confectioner's sugar that houses egg, chicken, nuts...and some other things. It was overwhelmingly eggy, but tasty. Not my favorite dish but had to give it points for creativity and uniqueness.  The flaky dough was delish- very similar to that of the Green Spinach Pie.\n\n3) Course 3- was our choice between two chicken (chicken with lemon olive oil or spicy cumin)- of course we did spicy cumin! It was fall right off the bone- so tender as I'm sure it was slow cooked for hours. It's also half a chicken so you get the breast, thigh and wing. The sauce was not too spicy, I thought, but the cumin flavor is smoky and present. The sauce is pretty slathered across the meat- and yes you can refill up on pita if you're not into eating meat solo. \n\n4) Course 4- is a choice between beef or lamb and since I don't do red meat, I passed on this. My bf ordered the lamb though and said it was very tender and yummy- and sweet. It was topped with almonds and something else that made it sweet. \n\n5) Course 5- Dessert!  You get fresh fruit and baklava (one piece each). Usually I think baklava is too sweet for me but this one was pretty good- and not too oily. I mean, yes, it was very oily but it wasn't like...drenched in oil. It was pretty flat, cripsy and full of that nutty goodness that you make baklava. Bf said it wasn't nutty enough for him. Again, the flaky dough wins. \n\nThe fresh fruit was also a plus- except our apple was bruised so we didn't eat that. We took our orange for breakfast the next day. There were two strawberries (not really regional, ha) and giant seedless grapes that were almost frozen because it the fruit platter came with a chunk of ice. This was almost like a cornucopia..they really do make you feel like emperor and empress haha!\n\nThe meal is well paced (slow) so you have time to breathe.  They sell only a few house wines by the glass; otherwise you get it by the bottle (there are a few varieties at $30 ish, as well as liquor and the like). My bf got two glasses of red wine- the burgandy. It was actually fruity and full of body, which was a plus. I ordered the traditional rose drink which I actually wouldn't recommend- it was really, really sweet. It was like rose syrup (sweet enough), with sugar and water..it was too sweet and at $5, I was upset I couldn't finish it. \n\nThis place accepts cash only and is $25 per person.

Would I really have to wait two more weeks when I would find solace in East Texas?   \n\n\"We can try Burger up,\" I mentioned.  \n\n\"Why don't you just call them?\" hissed the appropriately nicknamed Viper.  \n\nTrue.  We didn't have to keep driving around aimlessly.  So I call Burger Up, and a very pleasant, sweet voice assures me they are indeed open.  \n\nViper: \"What was her name?  She sounded hot.\"\n  \nMe: \"Paige.\"\n\nViper: \"Yeah, she's definitely hot.  Have you ever met an unattractive Paige?\"\n\nMe: \"Good point.  At least we have that going for us.\"\n\nPaige was indeed attractive, but this review isn't about a photogenic individual who happens to work at Burger Up.  It's about what ended up being a visit to our fourth choice for burgers in Nashville.  \n\nBurger Up follows a national trend towards upscale burgers.  My particular order consisted of a medium rare patty served with aged cheddar, Benton's bacon (very good), and ketchup served on an artisan bun.  Basically, it was a gussied up bacon cheeseburger, but it was a rather tasty one.  My major complaint is that I wish the actual meat itself exhibited more flavor.  Having said that, the burger was cooked properly and the flavors worked well together.  I ordered some wilted spinach on the side (mediocre) and truffle fries.  Let's talk about those truffle fries for a bit.  I know more people are apparently into the sweet potato fries here, but I think they are missing the boat.  Burger Up's truffle tries have pleasant aroma, taste great, and are the perfect texture for soaking up oil.  If you are on a diet, it is true you should skip these delightful fries.  But if that were the case, why are you at a burger joint in the first place?  Seriously, if you get nothing else out of my review, please do yourself a favor and order the truffle fries.  \n\nBurger Up also boast an interesting beer menu with semi-obscure breweries from the Deep South included in the list.  I tried a pecan-infused amber from Mississippi - not bad.  I could imagine Burger Up could be a decent place to drink for a bit after eating.  \n\nIf I attended Vanderbilt, I would probably go here on a moderately frequent basis.

Seriously, it's been in limbo since the spring time. What took so long? I guess, as the saying goes, you have to wait for the good things in life.\n\nAnyways, we had a little reunion with one of my buddies from out of town and went to check out Lee House's latest digs. The place was pretty packed for a Wednesday evening and is split into two different areas, the left side more compact with smaller tables while the right side is for bigger groups of families and friends. The restaurant has a very spacious, open air feeling and they clearly put a lot of time and effort into making things look great. I was hoping that they would put more of their focus on Korean BBQ, as Edmonton is seriously lacking a good place. We shall see, I'm sure things will change when they finish renovating their original Whyte Ave shop.\n\nWhile we were waiting for my buddy to show up, we perused the menu which has quite the variety of options. We decided to try several of their BBQ options but sadly, we didn't even get to grill any meat. Sad face. Also, I have to mention service was pretty weak, even for an Asian restaurant. We could barely hear when the waitress told us what our dishes were, had to ask for tea several times, and it was hard to flag down someone to take our order. I'm sure it will get better once they settle in.\n\nWe ordered:\n- Banchan and rice bowls - the banchan were all good, especially the bean sprouts and spinach. I just wish they brought out more/re-filled them during our meal.\n- Bibimbap ($10.95) - steamed rice topped with vegetables (carrots, spinach, zucchini, daikon, bean sprouts) over a lightly fried egg.  They brought out the Korean chili paste in a separate bottle, so you can add as much as you want. The bibimbap was decent but nothing to write home about. \n- Jap chae bokeum ($11.95) - potato noodles with mixed vegetables, black fungus mushroom in a sweet soy mushroom sauce. This dish was perfectly done! Noodles had the perfect chew. I think I just love noodles. Someone teach me how to make this at home.\n- Bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced beef marinated in a sweet soy garlic sesame sauce. \n- Spicy pork loin bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced pork loin marinated in a sweet onion, garlic chili paste. Slightly spicy, full of flavour, this was my favourite bulgogi dish of the night.\n- Sweet ginger pork bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced pork loin marinated in a sweet ginger sesame soy. I didn't get too much ginger flavour from this one, but it was still quite tasty.\n\nSo to sum up, first visit (of what I'm sure will be many) was pretty good. Lots of interesting items to lure you back. We'll have to make sure next time we try out their other BBQ items and do some grilling!

The building had it's 100th birthday in March and is located  Mid City in the midst of cemeteries, funeral homes and some residential.\n\nOur waiter Gregory N who formerly worked for a well known restaurant in town was humorous, professional and a native of NOLA. We started off with a bottle of Merlot and ordered the smoked deep fried soft shell crab and a cup of seafood gumbo. When the soft shell arrived I was taken back how large it was and tasted divine. The gumbo was also yummy and contained generous amounts of seafood.\n\nFor dinner I selected the Flounder, fried green tomato, and stuffed mirliton. OMG this entree was so delish. The fish was superb and the stuffed mirliton which was my first time experiencing and was delish. I can honestly say I experienced authentic Cajun food at Redemption. I sampled the stuffed gulf shrimp with crab stuffing and the taste was also outstanding. We ended our magnificent meal with the Crepes with Louisiana strawberries\n\nWhat's funny is how I stumbled onto Redemption's by dinning at their casual sister restaurant earlier in the week which is located in Prairieville - Tommy's Fish house. Christian who runs Tommy's recommended Redemption. \n\nWe had the pleasure to meet the owner of Redemption Marie and head chef Greg Picolo who were gracious to spend some time with us and make us feel welcomed. I must say that the seafood was the freshest quality and reasonably priced compared to several other high end restaurants we dined at NOLA.\n\nRedemption exceeded my expectations and I would definitely return here next time I'm in NOLA.", "date": "2013-05-07 13:54:08"}, {"_key": "6589", "_id": "reviews/6589", "_rev": "_fNypmWm--J", "review_id": "qyOa21EsbxMAWvMtwSBOqQ", "user_id": "61FNJUiDqXReViksOYiILQ", "business_id": "klGvxx2XmKkd-9mdRZoGVA", "stars": 4, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "text": "It's cool and it's free... why not check it out?

My Southern and Texas friends swear it is the best ice cream on the earth. When someone says, \"Best on the earth,\" that is like throwing down the ice scoop to a challenge. \n\nThe Blue Bell is located in the front of the store. It's on the backside of the huge glass display case for the truffles, caramel apples and specialty chocolates. When I went, I was expecting maybe six or so flavors being offered on a rotating schedule. To my surprise, there were over two dozen flavors to choose from. For a brief moment I felt like a kid in a candy shop. Oh wait, I was in a candy shop, that had an ice cream parlor too. \n\nThe young lady working the counter was very patient with me, as I was having a hard time selecting my first Blue Bell flavor. I finally went with, Birthday Cake. It was a rich creamy vanilla with pieces of chocolate cake and swirls of chocolate icing and bright colored sprinkles. I'm sure you have heard, sprinkles are for winners. After enjoying my Blue Bell, I now understand not only the love the South has for this ice cream, but why the South has an obesity problem. This ice cream is too good to resist. \n\nNow, I'll talk about the RSC. This store was amazing, I had no idea they had so much to offer. They had pre-boxed, by the piece, Jelly Belly jelly beans, Weight Watchers candy and some the most decadent caramel apples. This is a great place for picking up a gift for that special Aunt, Grandma or person that stumps you every time on what to get them. \n\nPersonally I prefer local chocolates, Kakao and Bissinger's, but for gifts and Blue Bell, I will keep this candy store on my shopping list.", "date": "2015-03-18 18:18:23"}, {"_key": "6958", "_id": "reviews/6958", "_rev": "_fNypmXq--O", "review_id": "9_JbFHSPm1NfMvjUx1ZIwg", "user_id": "Nw_qhJuPSsMmNrfU8mBWUw", "business_id": "SdZvOwgALlSBt8A0DvVkuQ", "stars": 3, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "15 microbrew taps, order food, pretty nice little bar but the Wi-Fi is so so slow slow slow.

This place holds its ground as a solid steakhouse.\n\nWhen you get the Prime Rib dinner it comes with the soup of the day which usually varies between..\n\nSplit Pea\nClam Chowder\nChicken Noodle\n\nYou could have French Fries or Mashed Potatos for your side or even mixed veggies if you want to lay easy on the carbs. \n\nIn closing, \"All hands on Deck\" all in the front, all in the back just like that! This is a place you \"Must\" visit when you are out here in Reno. I always end up meeting cool people in here and overall just enjoying the food here.

My lunch partner ordered a burger and liked it. I ordered the tutto mare and was disappointed. It was slopped in the bowl, drowning in sauce and too rich to eat more than a few bites.

I know that local Italian salads have a tendency to be sweet, but this one was seriously over the top. Prices were a little high for the quality of food. \n\nOverall, my experience was just OK.

What a great way to launch a brand new venue with a music legend. \n\nThis gorgeously executed venue is massive with over 14,000 square feet of event space that can accommodate around 1500 standing attendees. The design layout is very thoughtful with 2 bar and restroom areas (on both Yelp Helps and Wanda Jackson, there was never more than a few person wait for the ladies loo. Shocking, right?) I also very much appreciate the front box-office area that is open at specific times for consumers to purchase tickets and avoid the sometimes highway robbery that is known as the ticket processing business. Ample free parking on the street and available secure parking lot spots are also available for a reasonable $5. \nThe icing on the cake for me is the coat check area. Ladies, you know what I mean... the worst thing ever is to attend a concert or event and have to drag your parka around like Linus's blankie the whole dang night... our husbands and boyfriends have had enough.\n\nIf you're lucky enough to make your way to the VIP Mezzanine, the view overlooking the stage and entire venue is quite splendid too. \n\nAs some of you know, I am a huge advocate for charitable causes and MMW is committed to making a difference in this arena. Their participation in Yelp Helps was impressive but they don't just stop there...each month MMW will spotlight one local nonprofit organization and collect items and donations at the front entrance during events and shows. To entice attendees to give, they will collect email addresses from those who do to register them for ticket-giveaways at the end of the month.

Lilly's is packed for lunch,  I've definitely never seen so many white people at a Vietnamese restaurant, and a good many of them seem clueless about Viet food but determined to eat it nonetheless.  That's a spirit worthy of admiration.  Now if they would actually try a bit of the sauce instead of eating plain dry vermicelli, or use the soup spoon when they eat pho, they would get a lot more out of the experience.  Perhaps the server should explain a bit or have a quick intro written into the menu. \n\nI was glad I got the vermicelli instead of the pho, which did not look appetizing.  The vermicelli was good.

Chip's pork chop was a spectacle of gristle and fat.  Despite its huge size he probably got about a half portion due to the bad cut of meat.  His potatoes were pretty good. His asparagus were missing, but when he saw the sad little overcooked spears I received, he figured he'd pass.\n\nWhen Richard came back and asked if we wanted a box for the uneaten gristle and fat we told him it wasn't necessary and explained why.  To his credit, he apologized and removed the $15 charge for my glass of Groth Sauvignon Blanc, which we thanked him for and appreciated the gesture.\n\nWhen we got the bill I noticed that I was given an additional charge for the asparagus, even though that was not mentioned when he offered the choice of broccoli or asparagus.\n\nI should say that the house chopped salad, rolls and maple butter were delicious and that's what made me give 1200 two stars instead of one.\n\nAvoid at all costs.

I immediately thought of Olia Zavozina. \n\nRecently being acquainted with myself, I was already impressed with her gorgeous collection of Limited Edition Dresses but knew that she is also known for her custom pieces as well. We made an appointment with her to meet her at her vendor space at Weddings 101 located in The Factory in Franklin.\n\nFrom the moment that we arrived, Olia made the happy yet nervous with excitement bride comfortable and had already preselected several dresses that were based off of the input that we had given her.

Why shop at David's Bridal or buy a dress off the rack at a bridal shop when you can have a locally produced limited edition or custom dress for a competitive price? Working directly with the designer means less back and forth with alterations which also means you cut out additional costs!\n\nMy friend is still debating about which dress to purchase out of two final contenders but she is certain that she will never forget this incredible experience.\n\nI will certainly turn to Olia when my time comes!\n\nTIP: OZ also offers Men's custom clothing and suiting for your wedding and beyond!", "date": "2011-03-21 20:46:32"}]
