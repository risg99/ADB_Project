I had a similar experience to Sara P. \nI joined in October. Got a GREAT workout. It was really enjoyable and definitely challenging. In December, emails about fraud, theft, employees leaving started coming.  My husband and I had purchased, but didn't get to use yet, 10 classes each for $85.  The new owners wouldn't recognize the 10 classes, but we can each have $85 credit. I was told we had till the end of Feb to covert the credit to classes but the owner said I may want to wait, as she offers specials in February. \nI email this week about a deal they have for 5 classes for $47. I get an email back that I can't use the credits for special deals.  What???\nI just want to use my credits, and walk away.

Considering the cost, it provides a lot of fitness opportunities. I look for a gym that has a lot of classes at various times so that I can fit in exercise before or after work. As my work start and end times change from day to day, though, I need a gym that has classes at various times throughout the early morning and mid to late afternoon.  I found that the class schedule here meets that need. The trainers are excellent.  The spin and row teachers are really exceptional.  Try the We-Fit class, but expect a huge challenge, even if you are fit.  The facility is very clean, but this is a new enterprise, so time will tell if the business will continue to keep things clean and fresh.

I find the rates reasonable and have been a member since they opened and will continue to be a member. So, for the rating I give the gym at CF a 3.5 star, I give MBSC a 1.5 star for an overall 2.5 star rating.\n\nMBSC review: I thought I would kick it up a notch so joined the MBSC thrive program at CF on South Street and tried it for three months. Trainers really aren't \"personal\" trainers. They have a set program that they put people through and you have very little to say about what you like/don't like. The trainers work with several people in a session so depending on how many people are in a session you could be waiting for the trainer to get back to you or waiting for the person in front of you to finish. One of the things that frustrated me is they want you to push through the routine they have come up for you in the hour's time. The sessions are hard with ropes, sleds, balls, bands, cables, weights and the most uncomfortable stationary bike I've ever had to sit on (and they make you end every session on the thing). No two sessions are alike - so if you like variety then great, if you like consistency or at least enough repetition to get the moves and form down then not so great. I seldom found a session to be fun or enjoyable, rather I often felt like I was a contestant on the Biggest Loser. They also play hip-hop all day long and you either like it or you don't. The environment and training is designed (in my opinion) to appeal to 20-30yo demographic.\n\nIf you really want to push yourself beyond your limits and don't care how you get there then you might really enjoy the MBSC program. If you want a professional personal trainer to spend quality time with you in achieving your goals and if you want a training program that you actually learn what muscle groups you are working and not just to be pushed through a routine then you probably won't like MBSC. Definitely do a introductory program because the usual 30 day notice from the contract date applies if you cancel and it's $200+/mo program.", "date": "2014-01-17 17:38:39"}, {"_key": "9195", "_id": "reviews/9195", "_rev": "_fNypmcS--I", "review_id": "ez69a3lm1h1UtJCoeDQtMg", "user_id": "bs5dGtIc0LC5Xlk-j98Vgg", "business_id": "5kZtETKu37RuwHATrB4a5g", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I personally have had a good experience so far.
