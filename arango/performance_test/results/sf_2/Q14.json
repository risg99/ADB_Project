The falafel sandwich that took its place was served on a rather hard bun, rather than traditional pita, which smushed the falafel as you ate and generally overwhelmed the flavors of the tzatziki sauce. (There are plenty of delicious falafel spots in the area that quite simply do it better.)\n\nThe drop in rating comes from the \"Express Lunch\" taking 45 minutes to get to the table (we had 8 people, most of whom ordered the Express Lunch, assuming it would be quicker than the regular menu). 45 minutes is not express and not at all useful when lunching on a time limit. It would've been nice if the server had noted that because Express Lunches are served all 3 courses together, they do not come out as prepared (they're held under a heating lamp till all pieces are ready) and therefore it might be faster for a large group to order off the regular menu. We saw other groups (including some of our colleagues) come and go in the time it took for us to get our food.\n\nI still like the space, as it's quieter than many restaurants, so you can hear one another more easily, but this latest experience took a hit on my recommending it for future meals. A tiny peeve: the \"giant cookie\" was regular-sized (small?) and fine, for oatmeal raisin.", "date": "2017-04-19 16:27:28"}, {"_key": "10010", "_id": "reviews/10010", "_rev": "_fNypmLW--B", "review_id": "0fnvV86zXmjFY4gbIYUjxw", "user_id": "k3LL4h53xyWJ-qj_u6XzrQ", "business_id": "sQPNcVLTkI0s6mpNiBEVdg", "stars": 5, "useful": 3, "funny": 1, "cool": 2, "text": "Knockouts opened on Super Bowl Sunday and I have been there twice so far to taste the fare. The decor is that of a boxing ring/gym. It is very clean with a fair bit of room. It is surrounded by a dozen or more TVs for watching multiple games playing at the same time. Their food is focused on standard bar/pub fare with an emphasis on burgers and fried foods. There is a second lounge area that is still under construction. They intend to have Karaoke there twice a week and possibly a cigar bar. The new lounge has a more upscale feel to it and an impressive bar area.\n\nOn the first visit I ordered the BBQ Burger (I forgotten the name it is under on the menu). It is a 1/3 pound burger patty served with onion rings, BBQ sauce and I believe lettuce and tomato. The burger stands pretty tall, too tall for a human being to eat it. However, removing some of the stacked onion rings brought the height down to a useful level. The flavor was good and despite the heft and wetness of a BBQ burger, the bun stood up to the task and did not fall apart. I had a side of onion rings and they were excellent.\n\nMy second visit was today and I only ordered an appetizer for lunch: the stuffed, deep-fried mushrooms. The site of the mushroom heads was about 2\" across and each mushroom had been cut in half before they were deep fried. I think this diminished the whole \"stuffed\" aspect of the mushrooms as there didn't seem to be much stuffing in evidence. The flavor of the mushrooms was excellent, as was the texture of the mushroom flesh, very firm and moist.\n\nThey do have a pool table, 1 or 2 darts machines and the ubiquitous Touch Tunes music system. The staff is very friendly and I found the service to be prompt. The food took a little time to get out, but I suspect that is simply because the place is new and they are still ironing out the kinks.\n\nI'm giving this 5 stars for a sports bar.

The service was probably one of the worst that I've ever received, which is too bad because it seemed pretty nice otherwise.\n\nI arrived with my fianc\u00e9 and the place was full so we were asked to wait by the entrance. No problem. A small table opened up after about 10 min, and instead of taking us to the table, the waitress led us to the bar. I usually don't like sitting at the bar because I'm short, and this bar was exceptionally tall. When sitting, the countertop came above my chest and I wasn't able to rest my arms comfortably. Who wants to eat like that? We requested to be seated at the table that was just cleared, and she informed us that she wanted to give that table to the family behind us with a child. Okay, fine, I understand that children can't sit at the bar, so we agreed to let them have the table. We let the waitress at the bar know that we wanted to move to the next available table and she said sure, no issue. Another waitress comes by to take our order, we explain our situation, and she comments that if we want to wait for a table, we shouldn't be sitting at the bar, like it's our fault for being at the bar in the first place. She did acknowledge at least that there were plenty of open bar seats at the time, so it was ok for us to sit there \"for now\". After another 5 minutes, the first waitress comes over and asks us again \"Are you sure you don't want to sit at the bar? If you move to the table you will have to wait longer for the food to come out.\" At this point, I'm frustrated but I've already invested some time. We tell her (again) that we do not want to sit at the bar, but if waiting for the food is an issue, then can we order now please? They take our order, and after another 10 minutes, we see another open up. Not unreasonably, we thought that would be our table... Until we see the same waitress gesturing to another party waiting at the entrance, letting them know that will be their table. She comes over and tells us that she had already promised that table to them, and asks us again if we're sure we don't want to sit at the bar. At this point, we were so fed up that we just walked out.\n\nI thought that we had been plenty understanding and even let that family go ahead of us, but they were just completely taking advantage of our patience and niceness.

So I was on my way through Nashville while on a trip to Texas from Maine with my girlfriend and decided to stay in Nashville for the night. We stopped by this restaurant and started off with some drinks which were both fantastic beers that were recommended by our waitress. We then ordered our burgers, I ordered the chili-chili bang bang and the Benton's bacon mac and cheese and my girlfriend got the buy the farm and truffle tots. Now here's where things got interesting and the reason why this place gets a 5 instead of 4 from me...... I got my food (which was cooked perfectly and had plenty of flavor) and my girlfriend took a bite into her burger and pulled out what appeared to be plastic from it. We politely told our waitress and she took the burger right back and had them make a new one for us. The manager (I believe, it may have been the chef) comes out and apologized and you could tell he was very remorseful and that this is not a regular occurrence. He explained that the wax surrounding the cheese must not have come off and fixed the burger immediately and triple checked everything again. He even came out with two extra sides of tots and quickly brought her burger back. Then to top off this already incredibly generous gesture, they comped her entire meal for us (which they didn't have to do, for after that level of service I would've been glad to pay full price). We made sure that we still tipped over 20% of the original price of the meal before some of the food was comped for the excellent service. I went in to try and shake that gentleman's hand but he had gone out back right as I was leaving. I would recommend this place to anyone of my friends who are traveling to Nashville, and I will definitely make a repeat trip the next time I'm here", "date": "2015-05-12 19:07:18"}, {"_key": "10280", "_id": "reviews/10280", "_rev": "_fNypmLu--J", "review_id": "SZ-wvMItkUd-PF-5yK2y0g", "user_id": "1PnSaUpAYbZSxAOsk_dJnw", "business_id": "EQ-TZ2eeD_E0BHuvoaeG5Q", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "The breakfast menu and pastry menu changes so some visits I have liked more than others, but I love the way they do there menu, the overall quality is top notch.

Very friendly staff and bartenders are very attentive to the guests at their rail.\nMoving on...Parking in the area is a challenge small streets don't help either. I understand it is something out of there control but when developing a restaurant your seating calculator is based on parking spots available. This will let you use areas more productively and efficiently. Also it is very confusing where the front door is or where guests are to come in. The signs in the back just make things more confusing. We would have enjoyed sitting outside the weather was not too bad but with properly placed fire pits you could take advantage of all your patio seating.\nOn to the menu, limited but great because of the size of the establishment and very well priced. The selections were good and diverse which is key to satisfying a variety of palettes but...if you offer small a menu everything that comes out should be perfectly cooked and should taste as good as it looks. I had the pork chop unfortunately it was cooked to a med rare. I do like my pork medium but rare is wrong. My wife had the salmon which looked slightly overcooked but she was fine with it. My friend had the bone in rib eye which was cooked well but as far as taste you can tell it was choice grade and lacked a beefy flavor many look for when ordering that cut. His wife had the tilapia and she did not eat it at all! The breading was soggy and tasteless and was non-visually appealing. Too many bland colors on the menu plate presentation is everything! If it looks good it taste good! \nAlso we noticed the menu doesn't offer a description of your sides which this technique is usually used in ala carte menus. I am sure your mashed potatoes are a staple to your menu, but it's important for your chef to check potatoes often through the night because they will brown and become gummy if not maintained right as mine were no good. All of us who received the side of vegi's we received cold and very wilted and over cooked. \nThe last item is we never saw a managers presence we had a food issue and no one came to our table to follow up with us. There was also a table that had children running and screaming which causes safety issues for your staff and the children.

We got the $65 oyster platter which came with 12 huge and succulent oysters, about a dozen each of clams and mussels, 10-12 tails of jumbo shrimp, about half of a huge king crab, 2 small sauce cups of ceviche, and 3 different sauces including a malt vinegar, cocktail sauce, and a spicy mayonnaise dipping sauce, as well as multiple wedges of lemon.  The platter was huge and probably could have fed 3-4 people, though I was able to eat most of it with some help from the fiancee.  The oysters were fresh and delicious and were the star of the platter, while the crab was the not seasoned and somewhat bland compared to the rest of the platter.  Of note, I liked the shrimp as they were steamed with a spicy cajun seasoning which was a nice Louisiana touch.\n\nWe also ordered the fried oyster, bacon, romaine lettuce, and avocado salad which was decent.  The fried oysters on the salad were perfectly prepared, though the bacon was thick cut and a bit on the tough/chewy side (i prefer bacon in a salad to be crispy).\n\nTHE BAD: Service was horrible.  I think we got the worst server in the restaurant; here's the breakdown: His appearance--his long hair made me think he should have been in an 80's hair metal band instead of serving in a moderately upscale seafood restaurant.  His service--inattentive: 1. he never introduced himself before taking our order, 2. he didn't allow us to finish our order as after we ordered our oyster platter he took our menus and walked away and I had to get another waiter/server to order a salad that we wanted to come with our oyster platter, 3.  He forgot our bread, and we didn't realize we were supposed to get bread until halfway through our meal when we saw other tables getting bread, 4. We asked him for lemon with our water and he forgot after multiple queries, and we actually asked 3 different waiter/waitresses/servers for lemon and they all forgot, though our main waiter eventually remembered and brought the lemon to us in the middle of our meal.  The final straw in this terrible haystack was his apathy and rude demeanor at the end of our meal--after taking my credit card and charging for the meal, he walked by our table and threw the credit card/receipt pad so that it plopped on our table and said \"here you go\" and continued walking away like he didn't care.  Overall, it seemed like he did not really care for his job and was there just going through the motions.  I was surprised that a restaurant of Luke's stature hired a waiter like this, as with an appropriate waiter and appropriate service, this meal would have been phenomenal.  Unfortuntely, the service left us in a sour mood despite the quality of the food.  If the service would have matched the food, Luke would have deserved a 4 or 5 stars in my mind, but because of the poor service we received, I gave the restaurant 2/5 stars.", "date": "2014-02-24 03:58:18"}, {"_key": "10537", "_id": "reviews/10537", "_rev": "_fNypmMG--P", "review_id": "HJpTp-cXIAIBm7dyARaXBg", "user_id": "JG2d1wLMtMKS5vlaqRNIVQ", "business_id": "Tq5jFk_BMSJG8-flqj5Bgw", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This unique pizza place is possibly one of my more go to places to eat with my mister.

However, we became frustrated when we noticed there were 4 open tables on the patio that still hadn't been seated after an hour of waiting. It was a beautiful day so we asked the hostess about it and she said that the tables were reserved. When we asked again, she explained that the patio tables were not assigned to a specific server but were instead added on to a server's load inside, so they weren't seating them because they didn't want to overwhelm the servers. Totally understandable to not want to overwork your servers, but why not seat people with the caveat that service will be slower? Or better yet, why not specifically assign a server to the outdoor section so that wait times will be lower? Having worked in the service industry, our group was confused by this. We ended up just sitting at one of the empty patio tables until the hostess notified us that a table was ready. \n\nWe ordered the Cheddar Biscuit, the Wood Fire Double Yokes, and a Turkey Feta Omelette from the specials board and all were delicious. The biscuit comes in a trio and though it doesn't look like a lot of food they are VERY filling. Our server surprised us with a side of White Trash Hash on the house because our food was taking longer than expected (we didn't even notice the timing, so it was a very nice gesture). The White Trash Hash is a must, this stuff is addicting! Potatoes, rice, and gooey cheese- who could ask for more.\n\nOverall, great place for brunch in Nashville.

We were fine with tap water, which was served European style-- lukewarm with no ice.  Since it was 83 degrees outside with 70% humidity, we found this unsatisfactory and had to request ice.\n\nWhen we asked about the tasting menu, we were told that the serving sizes were very small and we should get something else.  I find it obnoxious that a restaurant advertises a special and then when you get there they try to convince you not to order it!  \"It will never satisfy you!\"  Then why are you selling it!?  If the answer is \"bait and switch\", then it's  a fake deal.  It tells me you don't want repeat business.\n\nEveryone else in my party ordered something else, but I stuck with the tasting menu.  After all, that's why I showed up.  True to the waitress's warning, the three dishes which comprised the tasting menu failed to satisfy.  There was a tiny crudo (raw whitefish with rock salt) paired with a heavy red, a tiny mushroom pizza paired with a sparkling rose, and a thick piece of toast with a thin layer of prosciutto paired with a riesling.  In that order. \n\nThe flight of wine was lower quality, didn't pair well with the  food, and the servings were miserly splashes.\n\nThe crudo was so over-salted that I had a hard time eating it and it made no sense with the red.  I'd just started on the mushroom pizza when the waitress dropped by to ask if everything \"tasted wonderful\".  I said that the mushroom pizza was nice, but that the fish was too salty.  She replied, \"here, we love our food salty\".  I don't think that insulting your guest's palate is a great customer service technique.  \n\nTo sum up, the tasting menu, far from being a chef's calling card, an opportunity to experience something fun and creative, was a half baked and poorly executed marketing exercise-- and a terrible value to boot.    No one else in my party was particularly impressed with their dishes either.  The phrase \"not bad but overpriced\" came up a lot.  I wound up embarrassed that I'd suggested the place.\n\nAs a final insult, Moto's enforces mandatory 20% tipping.\n\nMoto Monday ensured that I won't be back for Tuesday through Sunday.", "date": "2016-07-15 01:40:46"}, {"_key": "10651", "_id": "reviews/10651", "_rev": "_fNypmMS--H", "review_id": "eB7NmWNq79J12x0vkmPWjw", "user_id": "bpgKKIpdAmtqdzJT5X3xRw", "business_id": "DeVlppoc8dPBhOCPrm4wmg", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Harry and Izzy's is classy and delightful.

Used to be a treat to go here and now it is just really expensive. Their target audience is clearly only people over the age of 60. There wasn't anything special about the appetizers or desserts, and unfortunately the cliche crab cake and chocolate lava cake were the only highlights. \n\nThe old fashioned cocktail was a healthy pour, but the most lack luster of Indianapolis, and a featured drink on their menu too. I think the bitters were forgotten and the orange zest was just a small piece of torn off skin. The glass had a single large ice cube, but they brought out the bourbon in a decanter filled with small ice cubes. It was barely anything more than very very watered down bourbon by the time it was poured. Guess they only know how to serve wine. \n\nFor entrees, I ordered the special, a dry aged New York strip, but it was totally overpowered by a thick pepper crust, which completely ruined the point of the dry aged flavors, for $60. To add insult, the steak knife was duller than  the butter knife, and I never had to work a knife that hard in a white linen.   The lobster tail for $26 was dried out and mediocre. The highlight of my wife's $50 salmon was the hollandaise sauce and side crab, the salmon itself was thin and uninteresting. \n\nWe opted for the chocolate lava cake for dessert, which was the only thing worthwhile. The dessert menu was boring steak house safe bets: lava cake, cheese cake, berries and cream, creme brulee. \n\nService was very good at least, although slow for being a quarter full on a Thursday night. \n\nOverall, a rather disappointing showing and it seems they have gone the way of Ruth Chris and outlived their Glory days. The dry aged steak dish was completely mis-designed and the menu is just as stereotypical unimaginative steak house as it gets. In hindsight, we probably could have had a far better, or at least similar experience, across the street for a hundred bucks less, not to mention whats available in half of downtown Indianapolis.

It's usually not worth the effort, and if I don't like a restaurant I simply won't go back. But this place... my goodness. Easily one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had. \n\nOrdered the Veggie Benedict, but asked if I could have it with egg whites. The server was puzzled and said that it already came with egg whites. Ok no big deal, it was strange that it wasn't listed that way on the menu but whatever. The server comes back a couple minutes later: \"It does come with normal eggs! All this time I thought poached eggs meant egg whites.\" Uh, ok. A bit odd for a server at a restaurant that literally specializes in eggs, but still not an issue. She asks if I do indeed want the egg whites, and I say yes. A couple more minutes pass, and she comes back. \"Our kitchen doesn't know how to poach egg whites, so if you want them they'll have to scramble them.\" What?? You poach an egg white just like you poach an egg. But whatever, I don't care that much so, \"Sure, that's fine.\"\n\nIt took us a very long time to get our food. The restaurant was not busy. Empty tables, no wait.\n\nFinally our food comes out, and what do you know it's cold. Not just room temp. Cold. We mention it to the server who proceeds to tell us it's because the restaurant doesn't use heat lamps because \"they have so many hands.\" Apparently not enough hands to get the food out within a half hour, and to get it out warm. \n\nOn to the food itself. I ordered what should've been a relatively healthy, easy meal. I got a plate that was literally covered in so much oil that my bennies were swimming. We're talking greasier than the greasiest Chicago pizza, but not due to fat from sausage or cheese. Oh no. There is no reason it should've been greasy at all, since all it had was spinach, wild mushrooms, asparagus, and tomatoes. It was literally just vegetable/canola oil. Even the side salad was drowning in its oily dressing. It was to the point that my own mother commented that if it had been her food, she wouldn't have touched it. We're not picky eaters; we eat anything and everything. So I proceeded to try some of my cold, oily concoction and unsurprisingly it tasted like nothing. It was so oily that none of the flavors of the vegetables could come out, and left my mouth, lips, and even fingers shining. And the hollandaise... oh god. What should've been a nice lemony-buttery sauce was a blob with the consistency of expired box pudding. Skin and all. And it tasted like nothing I've ever had before... maybe similar to cheese wiz? The stuff in a can? Yeah. \n\nWith all of the other brunch places around (Wild Eggs, Yolk, First Watch, Le Peep) there's no reason anyone should go to The Egg & I.", "date": "2017-11-18 20:47:43"}, {"_key": "10764", "_id": "reviews/10764", "_rev": "_fNypmMa--d", "review_id": "QJ46O6mR_R5XgfenGvR39Q", "user_id": "-f7hMcmoh_0pigmUfwE3_w", "business_id": "BjBDHqHhMXSxgyVipccznQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "text": "My wife and I have enjoyed dinner at this establishment many times.

It works REALLY well, texture-wise.  Liscio's rolls were fresh and shiny, and the Wacky Wednesday deal of a large for six bucks was fortuitous. They usually have SOME kind of deal going though.. Meat was tasty and not gristly, the white American cheese melted like a dream (but short of the sauce that Steve's is.)  I got more meat than my son did, but both were acceptable portions.  Fried onions were 1/4 inch cubes, and caramelized beautifully.   Crinkle cut fries only get so good, but these were pipjng hot, and the Whiz that came on the side worked great on the sammy as well.  Lots of people on Yelp complained about the Whiz, but I could see it along with American as a great combo.Whiz is what Whiz is.\n\nPossibly the REAL best thing here is the 1949 vibe.  This place is a time capsule, where only the prices have changed (and pretty minimally at that) over five decades.  Everything (including real fountain sodas) are made to order. Milkshakes (the half and half was very popular)  were killer.   Waitstaff is attentive and friendly as you are likely to find on the East Coast.

The Yelp reviews were pretty positive, so I figured we'd give it a go. Most of the reviewers are correct. This food is FANTASTIC and made with high quality ingredients.\n\nGiven that we were going the Sunday before Memorial Day, I called ahead to make sure they had some availability. The hostess told me we'd have a table for 1pm, and we arrived a little early. Another couple also had a table for 2 for 1pm, but due to a clerical error, they could only seat one of us. We gave it to the other couple. This ended up being a pattern for their other patrons who presumably arrived on time and had to wait. This is a pretty bad error considering how much it happened, but given the rest of the experience, I can't deduct a star over something like this. Just be aware that it happens. They were very busy that day, so it took a while for us to get served, but again, not enough of an issue to deduct a star.\n\nMy boyfriend and I enjoyed the quaint environment and bright colours of the place. It had the same feel as Pop Shop, a grilled cheese place in Collingswood, NJ. It was very cozy, well lit, and country style, what with the counter you can eat at.\n\nWe split an order of blue duck fries to start, and they came in a mountainous pile in a large white bowl. Gouda was melted over them with a healthy portion of green onions, as well as some juicy pulled duck meat. Honestly, our meal could have ended there. We were so pleased with them and devoured them in silence- a sure sign of amazing food.\n\nSince both of us came in wanting eggs benedict, we ordered it. Duck benedict with a perfectly poached egg, topped with more green onion and a SRIRACHA HOLLANDAISE. Yes, you read that. Expecting the usual overly hyped sriracha dish, we were proven wrong when the perfectly textured sauce had a nice sweet finish to it, as true to hollandaise. The bread the benedict was placed on tasted like nothing less than homemade bread (could be wrong, but it was fresh and fantastic). The duck on these eggs was probably 3/4in thick- it was extremely juicy and was a very generous, flavourful cut. Nothing in the duck benedict overpowered anything else. All fantastic flavours were appreciated and identifiable. \n\nAll in all, service was meh, but the brunch food 100% overshadows any issue we had with the service. A warning, though, the brunch menu is not very extensive. The choices, however, are very diverse in flavour and taste.

To which, my server responded, \"Sure...we have a house roast, dark roast, or a vanilla flavored?\"\n\nAre you kidding me?  A breakfast place with coffee OPTIONS?  And, one of those options is DARK roast?  Color me caffeinated.  I promptly ordered their dark roast which came poured out of a carafe left at the table.  Plus, they have flavored creamer (bonus!).  This was definitely not your usual (awful) diner coffee.  It was dark and delicious.\n\nFortunately, my dining companions were familiar with the menu and HIGHLY recommended the Salmon Eggs Benedict.  Always a fan of anything including hollandaise sauce--I went for it.  My people!  Perfection.  Here's the thing, when you smother something in hollandaise, you can easily be lazy in the preparation of what comes UNDERNEATH the hollandaise.  I mean, it's going to be smothered in all that lovely, buttery deliciousness--who will notice?  I will notice, people.  I will.  And, there was definitely nothing lackadaisical about the preparation of this dish.  The salmon, even without the hollandaise, was moist and flavorful.  The eggs were perfectly, beautifully, delicately poached.  It was the single best Salmon Benedict I've ever consumed (possibly the best Eggs Benedict in general!).  \n\nThe Benedict came with a side of home fried potatoes, which had a light peppery flavor that I quite enjoyed.  The service was spot on--prompt, attentive, and friendly.\n\nOne final note I have is the menu:  The menu is expansive.  If you have family and/or friends in town with diverse tastes--this is a wonderful option for breakfast.  They have all your classic selections covered (bacon & eggs, chicken fried steak, various scrambles).  They have the sweet (pancakes, stuffed french toast, waffles, crepes).  And, they've got your savory (An entire list of various Benedicts, skillets, and classic to creative omelets).  I can't imagine anyone NOT finding something they'd enjoy.\n\nPlus, I was informed they have an entire gluten free menu.  Not merely the slight modification of items on their regular menu--but an entire menu of creative gluten free options.\n\nGet to it!", "date": "2014-10-11 18:39:04"}, {"_key": "11153", "_id": "reviews/11153", "_rev": "_fNypmNK--D", "review_id": "uq9IhADYfub6Abv1MewTIA", "user_id": "EI8C77ht9bTtp_27daGhvg", "business_id": "dz_aIFbATP2PLWQSOBnMfw", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Came in here after our red-eye flight.

All I can think about is how fantastic it's going to be when Spring/Summer happens and they open the doors and have seating out on the patio.  I will be bringing my OB, and planting my arse there for hours, that's for sure.\n\nI went there (thanks to Yelp!) a couple Saturdays ago for a late breakfast / early lunch.  I was paranoid there wouldn't be any tables, because that's how I am whenever I go somewhere with an above-average Yelp! rating, but the place was pretty empty at around 10:30 a.m., so we got a spot by the window.\n\nI was immediately charmed by the warm yellow walls and metallic ceiling tile-thingies (I'm so not interior-design-savvy), and the case of mysterious desserts and granola-y looking items.  I say mysteries because they didn't have any labels, nor did anyone mention them on any menu I saw.  Also charming was the four-top of older, nicely-coiffed ladies who were literally discussing various iterations of Bridge (apparently there's something called \"the _new_ bridge,\" which is played by the most foreward-thinking old ladies, but hated on by actual old ladies), and saying things like, \"Doris, you have *got* to come over for Mah Jong.\"\n\nThe menu was pretty awesome.  Saturday mornings, they put out the Mid-Day menu, which is a smattering of both breakfast and lunch items.  We had envisioned breakfast at first, but then they described the soups, so we changed it up.  My husband had the Silver Spoon Mushroom soup with cumin croutons and chili oil, which was amazingly rich and has to be a calorie-fest.  I got the turkey and escarole soup which was light, tasty, and more escarole-y than turkey-ish.  Then, my husband ordered this breakfast sandwich - homemade english muffin, bacon, caramelized onions, egg, and cheddar; I ordered the tuna sandwich, because it said it included pickled onions, and I was inspired to go there before 11:00 a.m., simply because they were going to let me. \n\nOur server, whose name I forget, was really welcoming, funny, and gorgeous.  We hung out for a while and had two ginormous cups of coffee, soaked up some rays in our window seat, and then picked up some menus to take home with us to pine over our next meal there.\n\nAny place with pretty people, sunshine, homemade english muffins, and local ingredients is a must in my book.

I stopped coming to red lobster... due to the fact you can go to ANY steak & seafood restaurant... and they will charge you the same price for FRESH DELICIOUS FOOD!   This was just sad!!!! Our bill was 110$ for 2 people and it was horrible.    I didn't order broccoli... but the servers had a large birthday party... so I really felt like they just rushed when with us.  I hate broccoli. When she brought out the food which was steak Nd a lobster tail.. she brought out my medium well steak that was cooked all the way thru. It was dry and flavorless.  And the lobster tail was tough, dry and just gross.   I asked her for some ranch , butter; and lemon. So I could drown my food. Considering it was near closing I didn't want to ask for anything to be remade... however they could have offered us something off the bill.    By the time she came back with the sauce I asked for at least 10 mins had passed. My lobster was cold to the touch.  Oh on top of they didn't serve my mash potatoes until 10 mins after my entree. For 10 mins my dry food sat on the table and got cold because it was disgusting and dry!       It was still nasty after I drown it in sauce. All I ate was the rice(that I had to ask for after she brought out the dry old looking broccoli) and the mash potatoes. Which we paid more for lobster Mac but was brought out the smallest portion I've ever seen.    I've ordered it before and never gotten a portion this Small.     I'm also PRETTY POSITIVE Our meal came with a salad. Matter fact I KNOW. Because we've ordered the same thing before. They never even brought us OUR SALAD!

Here is The Good The Bad The Ugly and Low Down Foo\n\nThe Good- I am struggling to find something amazing about it. I wouldn't say good but just ok the Cuban and Mac and cheese (needs salt and pepper). Our waiter rocked though.\n\nThe Bad- not sure I would classify this as a gastro pub based off 3 factors: \n\n1. the ambiance it's more of a sports bar/ banquet with white linens, weird wall paper, big screen tvs playing sports and a big wide open space, a true gastro pub should have a cozy or rustic vibe that makes you want to relax and enjoy it. \n\n2. Should have extensive craft beer and cellar beer list... I believe  they had 20 beers most were domestic bud, bud light and the like. \n\n3. The food should be out of the box or fun plays on food. But it was just ok those Blue Chips where very bad though...Very bland blue sauce that seemed to be mixed with whole milk and was watery and tasteless. They could make it  amazing with chunks of blue, thicker sauce and something more to cut the salt on salt flavor.\n\nThe Ugly- craft beer 101 don't bring me a beer with a frosted mug it makes you seem like you don't know what your doing. You do not ever ever ever bring a beer in a frosted glass it waters the beer down. Also live band outside was way to loud.\n\nThe Low Down Foo- I think this place has an identity crisis... It's called a gastro pub but does have any of the features of one... But looks like a sport bar / private even space. \n\nI wish them the best but they just don't have any reason to get us back...

We narrowed our search to Burger Up and Cheeseburger Charley's. We settled on Burger Up and boy am I glad.\n\nI'm a fairly picky eater and hamburgers are one of my favorite foods. Unfortunately, all too many places really mess-up a hamburger (Five Guys included). We read some reviews here on yelp and still couldn't be certain we were making the right decision. Someone complained about \"family style seating\" (sitting with strangers) and another mentioned a \"dorked-up\" PB&J.\n\nFirst, let me say that the decor was quite unique. There were only a few tables where you risk sitting with strangers and I'm certain you could tell the hostess that wouldn't be preferable. Honestly, though, life's short. Chill-out and make the best of it. Are you really that unsociable?! The menu plainly states that it's grilled. Who's ever eaten a grilled PB&J?! If that's not what you're looking for, don't order it.\n\nFinally, for the burgers...\n\nI ordered the classic burger with white cheddar cheese and was completely satisfied. Someone complained that it was dry. You must have gone on an \"off\" night, because our burgers were juicy and quite tasty. The server told us that we could opt for Heinz ketchup, if we didn't like their house ketchup, but who wouldn't like their house ketchup? Good stuff. You also have a choice of regular fries or sweet potato fries. We didn't get regular fries, but their sweet potato fries were great, too!\n\nOkay, so no restaurant is perfect. Our server, Daniel, was great. Ambiance and food was great. The sweat tea was not good, nor was the lemonade.\n\nThere you have it. What they are known for -- burgers -- were definitely worth it.

I ordered a \"frozen\" margarita. It was the only frozen margarita on the menu and was pomegranate. It was okay, but a little off for my tastes. It was also melted and no longer frozen within a few minutes of it arriving. I only finished about half of it. We ordered during happy hour when the margarita is supposed to be $5 instead of the usual $9. We had to ask for the happy hour price, but more on that in a moment. \n\nThree of us decided to split a queso fundito. This is one of my favorite Mexican Appetizers and I order it regularly at traditional Mexican restaurants. While the queso fundito was still good at Besito, it was disappointing to someone that has had a traditional version. It is supposed to be essentially a fondue type pot of melted cheese with some chorizo and served with tortillas. Besito cheapened theirs by adding piles of onions and peppers. It was also served in a very shallow square skillet. When split three ways (and with the 2-3 others in the room that tried it), it left very little queso fundito. The flavor was good. However, with the added thick peppers and onions and the small quantity, I would not order again. \n\nI was able to try the chips, salsa and table side guacamole also. I will say that this is probably the best guacamole that I have ever tried. I loved the flavor and the thick chunks of avocado. The salsa and guac were my favorite things at Besito. However, I can't see myself paying $10 for guac on a return visit. That is just way too much for guacamole in my opinion. \n\nFor my meal, I ordered the Chile Rellenos Con Hongos. I order Rellenos anytime I see them on the menu since they are one of my favorite things. Most restaurants serve them with some rice and beans or some sort of side. Let's face it...stuffed relleno peppers are not the most filling thing in the world. My Rellenos did not come with a side. The came with sauce and nothing else for a whopping $18. I almost didn't order them when I saw the price, but everything else on the menu was that price or higher. The Rellenos had good flavor for the first bite...or maybe two. However, a few bites in I was over it. They are stuffed in goat cheese and there are globs of goat cheese on the outside. So much freaking goat cheese. I like the stuff, but it was overboard. That wasn't the worst part though, it was the pine nuts. There seemed to be a whole bag of the things mixed into my small plate. I would never order this again. \n\nOur service was great until it came time for the checks. Our waitress did not give us happy hour prices for the margaritas we ordered before happy hour was up. She also messed up dividing our appetizer between the three checks. However, the worst was that we handed the checks to them with our cards in each individual envelope. When they returned, my card was with my friends check (and had been charged) and my check was missing. WTH? It ended up taking us about 45 minutes to get our checks, get them corrected, get them corrected again and get out of there. My poor husband had dropped me off and was waiting outside this whole time since I thought I was almost done when I received the check. Uggg. \n\nI don't think I will be back to Besito anytime soon. If I do, it will be for happy hour only.

Mizu Sushi Bar, off Wash Ave., while not terrible, conforms to this sense of apathy that is killing a once bustling & eccentric area of St. Louis.\n\nFrom a service perspective, we maybe saw our waitress twice throughout our meal here - once to take our order, and another to pick up the bill. The empty chairs & tables during (what should be) a very busy lunch hour added to the poor atmosphere that we experienced. We had contrastingly high hopes for the food, as we were the only people in there, so we expected more care & time put into our meals. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case: my salad floated in a pool of creamy ginger sauce, our sushi rolls fell apart at the slightest touch, and my rice was overcooked & mushy. I'll give kudos to the Mongolian Chicken - it was quite good; well fried & seasoned perfectly.\n\nHowever, there are much better (and less depressing) places to find sushi in St. Louis.

I can understand restaurant not taking reservations, but the restaurant also has a policy that they will only seat when all parties have arrived. The parking is extremely limited - so limited the restaurant had to apply for a variance for parking. This means if you have to park on the street and want to drop off an elderly person or your spouse and young children, they will not be seated until you have parked and walked to the restaurant. Once in the pouring rain my husband dropped me at the door with our infant son, and the restaurant staff refused to seat me because my husband wasn't there yet, despite my explanation that he was trying to find a parking spot on the street since their lot was full. There were several open tables and instead of letting me get settled with a few month old baby, they insisted that I wait at the drafty entrance. I left and went elsewhere. I laughed out loud when we showed up for Mother's Day brunch a couple months later and was asked if I had a reservation. Although it states extremely clearly on their website that reservations are not accepted, they apparently make exceptions for Mother's Day brunch.

It's more of a bread than pudding and is at a sweetness level that can be enjoyed as a side instead of dessert. \n\nNow for the most important part, the sauces! One was a vinegar based spicy concoction that we mostly stayed away from and there was another \"mango\" flavored one that barely tasted like the fruit. The best is their sweet sauce, which is thick and similar to Sweet Baby Rays but with a little extra kick.

We had just briefly met Exec. Chef Casey Frank at an event this last Thursday, and decided to celebrate at Livery as we'd been meaning to stop by for awhile now. It seems he must have 1.) seen us come in; 2.) recognized who we were from the event; and 3.) remembered we had mentioned it was our anniversary that night - because after we placed our order of a salad and two entrees, the server came back out and informed us we should \"...forget about your order\" and wait for the experience Chef had lined up for us... \nWhat followed was an astounding 8-course small plate journey, with some of the most delicious and memorable flavor profiles we've encountered in Indianapolis. Chef Casey came out on two occasions to chat with us about the food and make sure we were having a good time. We felt like nothing short of royalty at 6:30pm on a Sunday. \n\nFood: (I'll highlight just a few dishes so as not to write a novel) \nSweet Plantains were culinary genius. Sweetness of the plantain, saltiness of black bean puree, spice from the habanero guajillo sauce, and brininess of the pickled onion in the pineapple salsa were perfectly balanced. The combinations were so complex, but you could still individually identify each component and the role they played in the dish. \nPork Tenderloin could be cut with a fork and was full of flavor. Slight char on the outside gave it smoke, which was complemented by an incredible sweet corn puree and spicy serrano hot sauce. \nScallop was the most well-prepared I've had in a long time. Perfect golden-brown sear on the outside, and so tender with not one bite of grit... A feat that, in my book, is quite an accomplishment! Served with a roasted carrot and poblano pico garnish, it was another masterful balance of sweet and heat while letting the seafood shine.\nChurros were a playful and well-executed nod to Latin street fare. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, with a wonderful caramel sauce that was obviously made in-house. \n\nService:\nOur server Tommy was a delight, from the first moment when he brought us 2 complimentary champagnes to toast. Friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive, he engaged my wife and I just enough to provide quality service and make sure everything was in order, while giving us privacy to enjoy each other's company.

I stopped in with my gal pals to take advantage of their happy hour which includes $3.50 screwdrivers and bloody Mary's, which are massive and not light on the liqueur.  We all ordered off of the happy hour menu which had 16 options for $6 dollars apiece.  Their regular menu is also massive so there is sure to be something to satisfy just about anyone. \n\nWe ordered zucchini sticks and jalapeno popper for appetizers.  There wasn't really anything special about the jalapeno poppers; there was no spice to them at all.  I'm the type that likes my stuff mild but this was no spice at all!  The zucchini sticks were good and I liked the size, they were more like a big French fry size which made them easier to share.  The zucchini wasn't especially impressive but anything deep fried is usually good.\n\n I ordered the beef sliders with a salad.  Two of my girlfriends got the chicken fingers and another got the chicken Philly.  Mine was certainly the best presentation; it was the best part about the meal too.  My sliders were served on Hawaiian rolls which were good but the patties were actually one hamburger patty cut into four pieces which I thought was really lame... If you're going to serve a slider at least make individual patties for it or don't even bother.  The hamburger was also really dry and had to be doused in mayo and ketchup in order to be eaten without choking.  The salad was good.  My girlfriends that got the chicken fingers were happy with them but I could tell that they probably came frozen and all Bully's did was fry them.  The chicken Philly was definitely the least impressive meal; the chicken was left in huge, tough, chunks and there was mention of quite a bit of gristle which is a deal breaker for me.   My friend picked at it a little but ended up eating hardly any of it.\n\nThe service was fine overall; no extra points for great service and no deducts for bad service either.  I would recommend going to Bully's for the great drink specials.  If you are going to get food stick with anything fried; Bully's doesn't get any extra points for being special or unique. The food had a good price but I can't say I would want to pay more than $6.00 for it.\n\nIf you want to see any other places I've reviewed check out my blog at: http://jparkhurst07.wordpress.com/", "date": "2012-03-30 18:13:41"}, {"_key": "11983", "_id": "reviews/11983", "_rev": "_fNypmOa--P", "review_id": "KBiV7ufZr1mj9Fh4iovWcw", "user_id": "5BpTDdcXblUeG2dV-xciWQ", "business_id": "GBTPC53ZrG1ZBY3DT8Mbcw", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Great little place for HH!

It was a fun, laid back, way to spend an afternoon.  Learned a few things.  Created and ate some great food.  If you're on the fence, definitely do it.\n\nWe attended a Sunday class that started at 11:00 AM.  The first ferry is at 11:00 AM on Sunday and the trip over only took a few minutes.

Bring *exact change*.)  \n\nI'd recommend calling him on the way so he knows you are arriving.\n\nWe ate a late breakfast before the class and that worked great.

Never in my whole entire life have I ever been to a place that handled a situation so horribly.

The host was very nice and was trying her best. \n We finally get sat and get drinks ordered and Our appetizers. It's going well, our server was nice and we were happy. Now this is where it goes down hill. Our appetizers come out about 5-10 mins apart. We brushed it off. A party that got sat after us were now getting their entrees? We start getting irritable at this time we've been in the restaurant for 2 hours. We finally start getting out entrees. 5 people are missing theirs. Sever comes over tells our friend their out of what she wanted. Would've been nice to know before everyone stared receiving their food. But she got to pick whatever she wanted for free, not bad. Everyone is now done with their meals and My friend beside me never got her food. By this time the restaurant is basically empty. The manager comes over and just goes \" what did you have\" my friend told her then she just walked away. No apology. Nothing. Her food finally comes out and she asks our sever why was she just now receiving her food? He replies with \"oh you know the kitchen gets slammed, things happen\" our jaws nearly hit the floor. Granted they comped her meal. But everything was poorly executed and the manager never stopped by to apologize, our server never apologized. \n  I guessed they assumed that they were gonna go down in flames cause they thought passing out a $5 off coupon for next time would do anything. Safe to say we spent 3 hours in a restaurant for a lousy experience. The food was decent but not worth it.

For what they seemingly lack in a way of app and entree selection they more than make up for with the quality, care, and innovation of their offerings.\n\nI landed after a long day of travel, famished. My lovely host, Brit S, picked me up from the airport, and after situating myself at the Conrad, we hopped the whole two blocks over to the Libertine.\n\n(It should be noted that former Indy CM Jon A also highly suggested checking this place out.)\n\nThe space is long and lean, with a formidable bar set-up and bottles for days behind the bar. Bitters and fruit and tinctures and all that, you know the drill at this point. The \"kitchen\" is also behind the bar, and the whole thing is grey and low light and trees/antlers and candlelight and warm and really nice smells. It sort of reminded me of a less formal Hinterland (located in MKE). Employees rock the whole Stumptown coffee look, but they're not nearly as in yr face with it as Stumptown is.\n\nOh, yeah.

A beet salad starter which Brit and I shared. Goat cheese and spinach and beets and yup, you guessed it. So so good, as beet salads can be when they're done right. Then?\n\n2. A chanterelle mushroom & fresh vegetable pot pie. Oh my god, I can't even. I love chanterelles, I love pot pies (secret favorite thing), so... you get the idea. Clearly handmade with fresh ingredients, I couldn't stop eating it. It was effing delicious. I was full, and yet, I kept eating. So so good.\n\nThe rest of the bites on the menu were on that whole gastro tip with an emphasis on the more foodie-focused. (God, I still hate the word foodie. I really do.) What I mean? I don't remember seeing offal or brains, but along those lines for sure. Marrow, elk, etc.\n\nAnyways, moving on (and this is important).

From the vintage sign outside to the wrought iron mustang carved enclosures that meet you at the front entrance, a subtlely hip James Dean appeal imbued the Prohibition.

Luscious looking carrots and cocktail onions and green beans came out on an equally verdant and zesty looking bed of fresh lettuce, but after my second bite I realized that looks can be deceiving. Let's just say this app tasted more like a vinegar plate than a pickled veg plate.  The veggie sandwich tasted overly seasoned and a few bites in, I couldn't even finish it.  I almost would have rather they served a Boca Burger and least gotten something somewhat tasty for my money. And then a quarter of the way through our sandwich, a slightly off cook (the head cook?) came out from the kitchen and kept offering the bartenders food, only to be turned down.

My friends really liked this dish, so I did want to mention. \n\n*Oyster Po'Boy - I thought the fried oyster was great. The breading they use to coat the po boy sandwich meats (and oysters) are really tasty and not overwhelming. I wish there was more oyster in the sandwich itself, but that would be the only complaint. \n\n*Beignets - warm and delightfully light fried dough and generous dusting of powdered sugar make this dessert just decadent enough. \n\n*Praline cookies - these were decent, but not the best I've ever had. The color was a bit darker than I was used to (more coffee with a splash of milk rather than latte color) and it almost tasted like they had burned/overcooked the butter or brown sugar. \n\nBeck's also has this authentic root beer from New Orleans available.

Both the lamb and the filet were excellent and extremely well prepared. They even bring out a bread basket beforehand which had a great selection. I can't comment on the wine as we brought a bottle with us- but other people looked happy with their drink selections.

When my work declared happy hour at this location, how could I not resist beating rush hour traffic to order my favorite craft beers?\n\nNow, I'm a fan of porters and stouts, so ML Rose never disappoints. This time, I ordered the Highland Black Mocha Stout from Asheville, NC which went down ever-so smoothly. It was quite frankly like drinking velvet. I've had the Japa Milk Chai stout in the past and was similarly thrilled. ML Rose is to beer as Nashville is to country music: it is the definitive marker of what beer goes. Period.\n\nIf you happen to be a huge fan of bar food, this location does not disappoint. I particularly appreciated the generous portion on my Carolina Sweets order. So, let me explain this magnificent paragon of culinary achievement: perfectly crunchy sweet potato waffle fries hugged by dollops of pulled pork, all smothered with a carolina mustard bbq and kissed by a few diced green onions. Talk about food that hits every tastebud high note: savory, sweet, sour, and (with a kick of hot sauce from your table) just a bit spicy. I suggest saving the entire plate for yourself because you will not be inclined to share. Trust me, this dish inspires selfishness in us all. While I have tried the Five Alarm Burger, I admit that what truly sticks out is the Caroline Sweets dish due to satisfaction alone. Bar none.\n\nBecause we did come in such a large party, I do believe the waitstaff struggled to handle the numbers. Beers were delivered late or could not be ordered due to busyness, orders were forgotten or delivered to the wrong people. Common mishaps considering the huge party that we made up. However, the quality of my food and beer were still spot on, despite my beer gazing at me from afar (for far too long). \n\nI would suggest the Charlotte location if you are looking for a less busy location, but this one is fun since it has a lovely beer garden in the back.

Decor was really nice and we got seated very quickly by the hostess, who looked to be all of 14. Our waitress arrived and that's when it went downhill. Maybe she was new, IDK, but it took her 3 trips to our table before she was ready to take our order. I asked for a beer to be brought with the meal and not beforehand and she assured me that was not a problem. I was wanting a burger but was told sides were extra, so I went with catfish instead. Wanted a kids meal for my grandson and was informed sides for those were extra as well. What next; extra for silverware? There were no crayons or colouring books for kids to keep them busy or child sized utensils either. Anyways, the food came quick and was tasty. Portion size was very good as well. The waitress came back to check on us after about 10 minutes, at which time my wife was able to inform her that the dressing for her salad, which was supposed to be on the side, was non-existent. About 7 minutes later she came back with the oil and vinegar. We were able to finish our meal and then wait another 10 minutes or so for her to ask if we were ready for our check. During that time we we able to watch as one of the male staff came up to the hostess station and was able to give long, lingering full body hugs to the 14yo and 4 others who had gathered at the front door. When he left, the girls continued the hug fest, in between customers coming in. Such love amongst the staff! 8 minutes later the check arrived, but not before 2 other tables had to go up to hug central and ask for their server, too. Going over the bill, at least I didn't get charged for the beer that is still in their tap! Overall, I feel this place is overrated, and it'll probably be quite awhile before I go there again.

You order either a salad or stir fry meal via a touch screen monitor (just like at wawa, for those familiar). I like to build my own, but they have several standard options to pick as well. \n\nMy only gripe is it was a bit light on meat. You can add more meat when ordering, but I would have liked a bit more with the regular order. Speaking of which, be careful when adding veggies on the build your own, after 3 you incur a $0.35 charge. Not a huge cost, but it can add up if you don't pay attention. \n\nAll the produce is local, which is great, but wouldn't necessarily bring me into or keep me away from a place.

The hostess sat us and the older manager was visibly not happy with where we were seated in the restaurant.  The french onion soup lacked flavor and could have used salt and pepper.  It lacked the beefy/wine flavoring that a good french onion soup should have in it.  The Beef Wellington, although beautifully presented was disappointing.  It lacked flavor and had no seasoning in it.  The Mushrooms/spinach/red pepper medley that it was paired with had CANNED red peppers in it. Seriously, a $25.00+plus dish with canned/jarred red peppers? It was like baby food.  The Flank steak had no seasoning to it and the sauce that it was served with it also lacked flavor and tasted like Mayo.  The chicken with shaved brussels sprouts salad was underwhelming.  The \"1/2 chicken\" was the size of a cornish hen. The server sold us on their \"amazing\" red velvet donuts for dessert.  That was a mistake. The donuts were hard and not warm, the \"white chocolate\" icing was hard as well and there was stale broken up donuts sprinkled around the plate with the chocolate.  The coffee was also luke warm.

There were about 7 of us, total. I called twice to change the reservation time, and they were very polite about it.\n\nWe were worried about not being able to eat here because we found out one of my friends has a peanut allergy. Knowing the way Asian restaurants work, a lot of them use peanut oil or peanut products in their food.\n\nThree people that worked there came up to our table to listen to our orders to make sure that they got it right, and to omit any peanuts in the dishes. I believe one of them might have been the manager. If that isn't good service, I don't know what is!\n\nWe ordered the roti canai (indian pancake), shrimp puff, young chow fried rice, hainanese chicken, sizzling beef, shrimp pad thai, deep fried shrimp with ginger soy sauce.\n\nThe roti is probably their most famous dish. Once you try it you'll know why. As soon as we sat down I asked if we could order an appetizer to start (since everyone was hungry and it was already 8pm). She asked if I wanted roti and how many, before I could even ask what I wanted. How'd she know? Two please!\n\nThe shrimp puff was so delicious! I'm warning you though to let it sit for a bit and give it 5 minutes. It is served HOT and WILL burn your tongue. The sauces tend to squirt out into your mouth as soon as you bite into it, which is no fun when it's extremely hot! Wait it out and you'll thank me later. The sauce was a nice touch to the shrimp puff. Very cohesive appetizer. You should definitely try this one.\n\nFried rice was average, as any Asian restaurant's fried rice is.\n\nHainanese chicken was very different ... never had anything like it. It's completely baked but served at room temperate so it gives off the feeling that it's being served \"cold\". It's actually pretty good with the soy sauce (which is served under the chicken) if you can get over the way it looks and the cold texture. We we're actually served a piece that was still blue and looked like a cyanotic chicken extremity which turned me off completely, even being in the medical field. Shivers. We decided just to set it aside and remove it so we wouldn't have to look at it anymore.\n\nThe sizzling beef was absolutely.. FORGETTABLE. Do not get this dish. It lacked flavor, and did not come out sizzling. Womp, womp.\n\nThe pad thai is also just an average dish. Nothing too special going on, probably would not get it again since I could get better pad thai elsewhere.\n\nNow I saved the best part for last.. the deep fried fish! It normally comes with other sauces, but we requested to do a simple ginger and soy sauce. This is the best fried fish, ever! We all couldn't get our hands off it and fought for the last morsel! Main reason it was so good was because it was so crispy! Good to share due to it's size. Fairly big.

We found a warm bustling place with a nice Saturday night feel and some decent barbecue.  Hendricks offers most meat choices that you would expect; both St Louis style and back ribs, pulled pork, brisket, turkey and sausage (what no goat? Oh well.)  Hendricks has a seriously large menu, obviously centered around barbecue, but the weirdo in your party could find something else to eat.\n\nWe had a great waiter, Aaron.  He was well informed ( I was impressed that he actually knew the definition of St Louis style spare ribs) and when we each ordered a Pick 2 platter, he informed us that each couple could split The Whole Shebang for the same price and actually get to sample all six meats for the same price, so that is what we did.  Apparently it is a default to serve the meat without sauce, which \"meats\" with my approval.  There are four sauces on the table.  Each of these trays of meat comes with four sides; so Ms T and I had two slaws, greens and sweet potato fries.  The D's added cheddar grits, sweet potato casserole, green beans and baked beans.  So here we go from first to worst.\n\nHendricks makes good ribs.  Both the St Louis style and the back ribs were smoky, moist, tender and nicely seasoned with rub.  The rub is the same on all meats and has a slight sweetness.  If it were over-applied, it would be too sweet, but it was in the proper proportion.  I would order these ribs any time and to me there is really no significant reason to choose one over the other.\n\nNext for me was the pulled pork.  I am not a fan of pulled pork in Missouri.  Often it is in large hunks and dry.  This was pulled to bite size and was moist, but not wet.  I would recommend this for a sandwich and it would be my second choice after the ribs.\n\nThe brisket was surprisingly good for this neck of the woods.  It had a good balance of smoke bark and beefy flavor.  It was nice and tender, but was on the edge of dry.  This would also make a good sandwich, but might require some mayo to lube it up.  I know this can vary a lot from brisket to brisket.  This is also worth ordering but at least this one night, was not quite as good as PM in Chesterfield  Valley.  Still pretty good for Missouri.\n\nTurkey breast and sausage bring up the rear and I would not re-order them.  Turkey is always a real gamble.  If it is not overdone and you get to eat it as it is sliced, before any juices run out, it can be magnificent, as we experienced at Black's Barbecue in Texas.  This had pretty mild smoke and was fairly dry.  It was not sawdust though and you could make a sandwich with plenty of mayo that would be credible.  I just would not order it again, though on another night it might be fine.  \n\nThe sausage was, hmmmm.  I almost liked it.  It was not like Hillshire Farms (a point in its favor).  It had some nice heat, Ms T and the D's found it too spicy but it is not really.  I like the locally made jalapeno and plain sausages in Texas.  They can be sensational.  My issue with this was that it tasted like Pine Sol.  This is either carelessness at the butcher shop with disinfectant or it has a spice in it resulting in that flavor.  Is it juniper berries?  A-1 Steak Sauce kind of has the Pine Sol thing going, maybe they are basting it with that or it is in the mix.  Whatever, all I can think of is \"the Power of Pine Sol, Baby\" when eating it.  I'll pass on that next time.\n\nSides - Ms D declared the green beans to be just a little better than plain out of the can.  (try some at Alcenia's in Memphis) They loved the sweet potato casserole, likening it to dessert.  They liked the cheesy grits and the baked beans.  I did not sample them.  Aaron warned me off the baked beans due to onion.  \n\nThe only think Aaron was not accurate on was the slaw.  He thought it had no onion, but that was all I could taste.  This is very finely ground (not shredded) slaw in the style that you get on dogs and burgers in Carolina.  It is unique, but inedible.  This was one of those rare times when we left the slaw.  It is unspeakably bad.  The sweet potato fries were fine.  The collard greens with bacon were good.  They were cooked well enough and seasoned with meat.  I enjoyed them.  There are even more sides to try.\n\nHendricks was worth the drive on a winter night.  I think we need to meet our St Charles friends, the L's there.  So go, have some ribs, maybe a pulled pork and brisket sandwich.  You will want to bring your own slaw.  I'm going to be generous and go four stars on the strength of the ribs.", "date": "2013-02-23 14:58:27"}, {"_key": "12617", "_id": "reviews/12617", "_rev": "_fNypmPe--o", "review_id": "ky31cUMjbHNul5mOkTJUrg", "user_id": "rcxQVKzWrSuIp3ygUENB1w", "business_id": "PW5eZM5RAQEhy3wgovChhQ", "stars": 4, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "I can't speak for anything other than breakfast but I've always enjoyed that from this place.

I am hoping the excellent food results in more seating!!", "date": "2016-09-18 21:22:18"}, {"_key": "12621", "_id": "reviews/12621", "_rev": "_fNypmPi--B", "review_id": "WzNu4kuaCUoYOvQM7fgnfg", "user_id": "m0JKd3kivFKCSay5-jF0Yg", "business_id": "Q1HHAb4FzrzfnnrRyA8fgg", "stars": 2, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Our server was very nice.  And, the manager was kind enough to take the chips/dip off our bill because there was a piece of plastic about 2.5\" in the dip.  Other than that, I am sorry to say that the food left a lot to be desired.  The sauce on the wings was not very good.  The batter on the fried pickles tasted like thick cornmeal.  The cheese dip that came with the chips tasted like the pre-packaged stuff you'd get at a carnival.  The mini cheeseburgers were hard and tasteless.  The regular cheeseburger did not have much taste either.  However, the fries and the Coke were good.  We thought this would be a fun place to go but were disappointed to find otherwise.  We are fulltime RVers who have lived or worked in 48 of the 50 states (we'll get to Maine and Conn. next summer to make it 50) so we've experienced the worst and very best of places to eat.", "date": "2011-11-30 21:05:11"}, {"_key": "12626", "_id": "reviews/12626", "_rev": "_fNypmPi--G", "review_id": "tADh39yT21-hdV2oG1lX9g", "user_id": "06JskCch79pI75sM4vzRRQ", "business_id": "I1h0GRYp86eX-XqwVXsSGA", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "The food is EXCELLENT!!!!
