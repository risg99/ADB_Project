# ADB_Project

The main intention behind this project was to study two NoSQL Databases, wherein we choose Document-based databases namely ArangoDB and MarkLogic. After familiarising ourselves with the same, we implemented it on a common dataset, in our case - Yelp Dataset. A bunch of queries were done to the databases and results were obtained and analysed.
